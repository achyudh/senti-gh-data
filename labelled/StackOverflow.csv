But sadly this is not working.,0,6
So everything builds fine but when we try to deploy the application to GFNUMBER we get the FILE_NAME file not found ''error.,0,78
That is what is causing your null pointer exception.,0,90
All attempts I've made were in a shortcut unsuccessful.,0,139
Don't use.,0,162
However when I try to run FILE_NAME it gives ``The system cant find the path specified error ''for the batch file.,0,187
Problem: without zooming the added content doesn't get visible.,0,200
in a application you can workaround with scaling the window size but in an applet I wasn't able to solve that problem.,0,201
else your GUI will be Hanged.,0,256
I am not sure about Map implementation in HazelCast.,0,342
But the above code doesn't work outside the ``FILE_NAME JavaAgent`` FILE_NAME of the main Agent.,0,361
Please note there is a bug in FILE_NAME L996 +997.,0,436
I am not sure why I can not get it to work and have been struggling with it for a while.,0,444
the problem is the following.,0,448
When I run my client it throws the following exception.,0,491
i did come across the same issue with Java API_NAME works in JDKNUMBER.,0,521
I am unsure how to return an array that will avoid returning CODE_FRAGMENT as an element of that array.,0,526
This is the first time I've encountered something like below.,0,580
NOT WORKING: directly compiled the src on Unix machine and used FILE_NAME files.,0,583
For some mystic reason the workflow is not enetering if ( )... Same exact code runs perfectly if I directly paste FILE_NAME files from Eclipse's bin folder.,0,587
It might not reproduce consistently but at one point you might see the issue again.,0,617
Still that does not guarantee that the first thread will run and only then the second one will check if the size > 0.,0,619
Eclipse error: `Failed to create the Java Virtual Machine '.,0,653
But unfortunately it can not be used!!!,0,726
Maybe there are some problems with the path of the file ( on my pc )!?!?,0,832
... but no such thing exists.,0,855
After entering the details when the button is clicked the entered data must be displayed as shown below but I am not sure how to align it.,0,892
But the file output messes with the chinese characters.,0,940
Not related.,0,964
Not even sure what JSR that is.,0,965
I had the same issue using a remote postgres instance.,0,994
I would avoid to generate the full XML String ( see @AdriaanKoster 'response ).,0,1027
I wanted to see all the files I have in my external storage I have this library that display the text to the user but when I'm using it to show the sub files it says something like.,0,1079
A workaround might be to use reflection however this isn't a generally recommended approach for a number of reasons ( brittleness performance problems breaking encapsulation etc ).,0,1152
That can hide an error and keep you searching for dogs a whole week while the problem was really a cat ( ch ).,0,1223
AS I know it's impossible in the case.,0,1230
It is not advisable to avoid an exception with an empty catch block even though you are completely sure that is not going to fail under any circumstance.,0,1244
You are really asking too much of the Java runtime ( and Jackson library ) by trying to make them infer all the required information about the type to be instantiated ( based on the parameterized return ).,0,1255
Server not starting in Eclipse Gallileo IDE with WAS7.,0,1261
Your API_NAME is messed up and doesn't list dependencies properly.,0,1336
Without that information you have to start the debugging process by guessing.,0,1388
so I'm not happy with it.,0,1424
Connections on the other hand are expensive and need to be managed carefully by the application.,0,1455
i try to return an output ( type date ) in a web service but i receive a weird result.,0,1504
My previous code example used CODE_FRAGMENT to fuse the filter and map operations but this was cumbersome and provided no advantage.,0,1566
At the moment I am receiving a ClassNotFoundException to API_NAME.,0,1613
I added it into my ANT_HOME / lib directory but it didn't have any effect.,0,1617
It didn't make any difference I receive the same error.,0,1622
An SQL EXCEPTION is being caught saying API_NAME: [ Microsoft ] [ ODBC Driver Manager ] Data source name not found and no default driver specified ''.,0,1663
If you've created your File IO and pulled from it in a weird way you can corrupt the encoding of the key material.,0,1763
But the exception is occurring.,0,1791
i'm having a difficult time figuring out to properly sort arraylists FILE_NAME though.,0,1797
I don't have any code to show because I don't know where to start.,0,1812
I am not able to find any documentation or info.,0,1921
I tried to download API_NAME file but I am not getting the file on net.,0,2008
I found API_NAME but that is for Ubuntu and not for Windows.,0,2009
I find this error when I am trying to open this file.,0,2010
There are many errors in this code.,0,2022
Used wrong column names which does not exist in the table.,0,2026
It's ugly and inefficient but it should work.,0,2041
Anyway their current behavior does not allow what you want.,0,2120
It seems that there must be some problem when genereting the response.,0,2127
I can successfully call my service but when generating the response it seems to crash.,0,2128
But as far as I create the entitymanager - which not necessary has anything to do with the response - it crashes... ( I still respond with just 200 ).,0,2130
The following warning messages should be ignored they are `false-positive 'alert messages.,0,2150
Since this afternoon it have started to give an error and the process ends leaving to process thousands of files.,0,2244
Its a little complicated there is a full example in this loadNativeLibrary ( ) method.,0,2259
Here is an example I don't understand.,0,2278
Bear in mind that the above code might not compile ( I haven't tried it out myself... ).,0,2298
Not sure why but I am getting following error from my FILE_NAME.,0,2399
The important different between these two approaches is that with the multi-threaded example there's no guarantee of processing order.,0,2468
since a day I have a very annoying problem - I can't run any Spring MVC application: / Today I have tried to write something basing at Spring Documentation.,0,2479
Any idea what i might be doing wrong.,0,2533
I think that you have a problem described in this bug report.,0,2575
Someone on StackOverflow had similar problem.,0,2578
i am trying with Jackson but im getting no suitable output.,0,2584
I'm a little worried that they use a ``busy-waiting ''mechanism as it would produce a lot of overhead.,0,2606
I don't want to get the last token and reuse it for the next query it does not make a sense since I want to use batch.,0,2656
Less margin for error.,0,2705
Wrong CODE_FRAGMENT CODE_FRAGMENT attribute.,0,2745
I was unable to get a perfect match.,0,2796
I am not able to deploy my App Engine project locally.,0,2824
You absolutly need to be compiling FILE_NAME JRE NUMBER!,0,2841
There is of course an API for the DRL compiler's parser but it isn't stable and as complex as DRL rule syntax which is considerable.,0,2862
I'm having trouble figuring out how to do this in drools 6 +.,0,2872
But this refernce doesn't solve my problem.,0,2899
This is an absurd unreasonable and frankly ridiculous requirement; I can't imagine what use such a data structure would be good for.,0,2928
First of all I do not think you need all these.,0,2938
This means it was not possible to resolve the dependencies of the API_NAME to the API_NAME.,0,2958
But now I think the problem is JNA creats temp files for the native librarys wit ``jna ''prefix and a unique generated numeric value.,0,2965
then I gets the module error again from JNA.,0,2971
This line gives the error.,0,2999
I am using standout library I added a videoView in it Everything is running correctly Except if i click on video then mediaController Is not Showing and i am getting null pointer exception.,0,3024
And an CODE_FRAGMENT argument type can never accept a CODE_FRAGMENT.,0,3132
But the underlying hard distinction between primitive and reference types remains.,0,3134
You have problem with classpath.,0,3172
Only the LoginHandler fails to compile.,0,3186
I can not read correctly a CODE_FRAGMENT and i have charset problem.,0,3214
If I give the 2 input given below it is showing an error.,0,3244
does not work without previously setting the FILE_NAME.,0,3287
They all fail with the following error.,0,3366
The following is the error I keep getting.,0,3382
But it isn't working like I expected.,0,3396
But unexpectedly I am getting 66.,0,3398
As an aside configuring the CODE_FRAGMENT that is created by the CODE_FRAGMENT is not supported.,0,3430
Why is it reading it wrongly?,0,3569
The error is as shown below.,0,3622
Exception in thread ``main`` API_NAME: Uncompilable source code - Erroneous tree type.,0,3623
I don't know if it is possible to show timer on cards.,0,3639
The problem is that when reader contains CODE_FRAGMENT it is not reporting ready.,0,3679
I tried the following and it returns nothing.,0,3681
I searched a lot but i not found any solution.,0,3798
What I don't understand is -- if one thread is still stuck deadlocked inside CODE_FRAGMENT then how come all the other threads were able to get past the CODE_FRAGMENT call?,0,3842
When I tried to compile the tool I get n error.,0,3848
I don't know what else to do to make things to work.,0,3853
I think the actual CODE_FRAGMENT would be a little more complicated to simplify.,0,3897
I have created a custom MenuBar in my Processing sketch ( using Eclipse as my IDE ) but it is not displaying.,0,3927
I expected there to be a CODE_FRAGMENT Menu in the CODE_FRAGMENT but there is none.,0,3935
but still nothing.,0,3965
But it's not necessary for our case.,0,4040
Java JTextPane JScrollPane Display Issue.,0,4079
I suspect there may not be a good solution for this right now.,0,4109
I thought that the problem was the ``id = null ''.,0,4141
I haven't used EclipseLink myself so all I can do is guess but what surprises me is that FILE_NAME doesn't have a setter for the id property.,0,4149
I learned that such beans are proxied using CGLib but still can not figure out how proxy can handle thread.,0,4167
This is your problem.,0,4275
This is not my intention.,0,4295
I guess my approach is wrong so I'd appreciate some guidance.,0,4333
This isn't valid Java.,0,4551
Well the funny part is we do not know.,0,4578
The data structure you are saving your data is not very optimal for the days with daylight saving time.,0,4596
This is part of the code which was working fine and now it's not.,0,4636
The exception is throw on CODE_FRAGMENT.,0,4637
I've notice that some of the feeds had false value.,0,4645
The problem is that you wrote.,0,4698
I wrote this code to update a patient in a derby database but it throws a CODE_FRAGMENT.,0,4775
I understand why you tried CODE_FRAGMENT but with the fix above we no longer need that we can just declare it CODE_FRAGMENT.,0,4812
Your CODE_FRAGMENT method calls itself recursively leading to an infinite recursion.,0,4813
CGLIB proxy did not work for my case.,0,4841
Problems creating JAXBContext to marshal object as XML.,0,4861
I'm about to hang myself with the little rope I have left.,0,4869
Here is a demo for the naive implementation which doesn't work.,0,4940
Because it's not initialized yet.,0,4942
( So the problem is CODE_FRAGMENT ).,0,4945
I need all subclasses to execute CODE_FRAGMENT but I can't rely on them doing it explicitly.,0,4947
Since this is correct why byte code noting down the return type of the called method and raising error when the library is updated with a return type for the method.,0,5101
Data loss.,0,5128
When I run the project I get the following error.,0,5219
As you can see the translucent text is clearly standard AA and rather than a clean translucent rendering it has that awful '90s ``spidery ''appearance.,0,5256
As others have stated this is not an issue with JPA/hibernate but rather with the json serialization library you are using.,0,5307
We ran into the same sort of problem with Flex and JPA/Hibernate.,0,5310
All seems OK but I get a NullPointerException ( NPE ).,0,5364
... Which brings me to the only downside I found: it might take a little while to wrap your head around TrueZIP.,0,5385
I am trying to link my native library to FILE_NAME application but when I try to run it I get a CODE_FRAGMENT exception complaining about missing symbols ( CODE_FRAGMENT ).,0,5409
( When I say don't use floats that includes doubles it's the same issue. ),0,5478
It's not possible using the Selenium WebDriver API.,0,5542
I have read the Doc but i am not clear what is meant by CODE_FRAGMENT.,0,5567
Annotations like CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT will not work unless you process them yourself and invoke the appropriate methods.,0,5607
There is a caveat with the above approach.,0,5623
It says that you dont export the JUnit Library into the build and if the build relies on the functionality of that lib there might occur CNF-Exceptions.,0,5636
If I run the code in the GUI it just hangs.,0,5649
I have looked and found that there are some packages that would automatically enter my keyring on login but that isn't really an option.,0,5655
When I first saw it I was horrified.,0,5670
Drawback of above approach not using copy of data is that thread safety is harder to achieve though.,0,5718
This code failed.,0,5791
You can not supply system properties to the API_NAME tool unfortunately.,0,5803
I have found out that certain misconfigured servers send an ``Unrecognized Name ''warning in the SSL handshake which is ignored by most clients... except for Java.,0,5812
You can't open CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT.,0,5878
This is an issue with how volley handles HTTPUrlConnection and retry policy.,0,5887
So it's basically in the wrong form.,0,5964
Avoid them.,0,5996
This may or may not work.,0,6114
On Facebook i ran in to a problem.,0,6309
The result was the same that i don't have the correct permissions.,0,6316
I am new to this so maybe i'm doing somthing wrong.,0,6326
And now my app is getting it's app Token and i can use it to publish messages but the problem is those messages can not be viewed on the app page it self.,0,6329
There's no way to do that AFAIK.,0,6378
You can't suspend a thread like that.,0,6385
Perfect would be to have in my CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,4
and then override this with CODE_FRAGMENT so that I could do.,2,5
Define your production environment as default profile in your API_NAME.,2,9
You can setup your API_NAME as filtered resource and have this value filled by maven from maven profile settings - that what we do.,2,11
Now you can use.,2,15
About setting default production profile already posted @andih.,2,20
So I do the following.,2,25
Many thanks.,2,39
Use this construct.,2,40
According to docs.,2,44
the way this projects i associated is.,2,57
In your FILE_NAME CODE_FRAGMENT has not been set and therefore is CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,89
I am trying to use JNDI for the JDBC connectivity but it returns NULL DataSource.,2,98
and hear is the code to connect.,2,105
Thanks for any help with this.,2,112
Also what's the difference between wait() and await() from CountDownLatch?,2,119
EDIT: I guess I need to rephrase my queries.,2,121
Await( ) as per the docs says.,2,122
With a CODE_FRAGMENT you can easily wait for all of the tasks to be completed.,2,131
Looking up the documentation is step one of any question.,2,134
CODE_FRAGMENT is an actual function of CODE_FRAGMENT whereas CODE_FRAGMENT is inherited from CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,136
What I am trying to do.,2,140
Well I thought I am authorized once I used my API_KEY to authorize my access to GoogleBook.,2,145
I did this like this.,2,146
Thanks.,2,153
You should declare CODE_FRAGMENT as CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,156
I can draw the circle with a transparent background like this.,2,166
I am executing a batch file FILE_NAME program.,2,179
I kept the batch file as a resource in the source directory.,2,181
resources/API _ NAME creation option: package required library into FILE_NAME ).,2,183
While Java can read JARs and treat them just as the normal file system most other applications can not.,2,191
Inside FILE_NAME that should trigger the batch file put the following.,2,196
actually it looks smth like this.,2,204
So try.,2,209
I am developing some small stuff for google app engine FILE_NAME.,2,217
That means you need to use the Google FILE_NAME files.,2,223
because this API depends on which server ( tomcat jetty ) you are using.,2,227
so it comes with the server.,2,228
Below are the features of Intellij IDEA ultimate edition.,2,232
Hope this helps.,2,238
I'm using Apache ftpserver ( Java ).,2,239
I need to have a nofication in my program when a file is uploaded through the ftp.,2,240
Any solutions out there?,2,242
I am assuming that you have a desktop program which is running on the ftpserver itself.,2,244
Lets see....,2,248
You can get all notifications using ftplet.,2,259
While there are modules that need a Spring context since they just wrap parts of the domain model we think that some of our APIs do not.,2,264
There is a central interface to access this API.,2,266
So a simple initialization would be.,2,268
It should mean either of the following two.,2,272
Or assuming that CODE_FRAGMENT is a specific implementation of the CODE_FRAGMENT and AInterface is the central access we could just say A uses a certain implementation of BInterface by default and so on and actually set them internally with new.,2,276
So we're wondering how do other API developers make their interfaces and beans accessible without relying on a context import ( which btw also clutters up the target context with many potentially unneeded beans like for example if an API provides several services and I only want to use one )?,2,281
But is there a way to have Netbeans automatically connect with API_NAME and retrieve these files?,2,293
Unless you start using Maven or a similar dependency management tool.,2,298
The name CODE_FRAGMENT is a package name and we only use the name of the site as a convention.,2,304
I have already created a custom access decision voter and using it in a custom access decision manager.,2,331
Can i use the Object o parameter specified in the vote interface method?,2,334
Your EntryListener will be called by Hazelcast's internal threads.,2,348
This can be done by submitting a runnable to an ExecutorService maintained by you.,2,352
I've attached a font (.,2,355
This library is attached to a Java Agent.,2,357
In that agent I can get an inputstream on the font file using this code.,2,358
Then I changed the client to use jQuery file upload.,2,369
in order to have a more powerful client ( with drag and drop ).,2,371
due to which spring dependency injection was working fine and was getting a bean through.,2,393
But now I have also integrated PowerMock in it.,2,394
You have to use the PowerMockRule.,2,398
and you should get the following test results.,2,402
With this annotation you don't need the PowerMock rule anymore!,2,405
I added CODE_FRAGMENT to my Java Build Path.,2,406
How could I add FILE_NAME files into the CODE_FRAGMENT file??,2,408
First declare it like this.,2,412
For example: if I have an excel sheet populated I can change the value of certain cells while leaving the value of others?,2,418
Thank you in advance.,2,419
Yes you can do it nicely using Andy Khan's JExcel library.,2,420
In order to improve performance data which relates to output information ( eg.,2,425
You'll have to write some utility to do this however it is possible to do in JXL.,2,435
Any help would be appreciated.,2,445
Here are my classes.,2,446
You use the simple array with the fix size 5.,2,457
It means that if you add more than 5 hobbies it will throw CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,458
The arrays are initialized to CODE_FRAGMENT by default which means that if you set less than 5 hobbies you try to call it on CODE_FRAGMENT which throws CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,460
So my question now is.,2,464
Any help here?,2,467
You will have to come up with a different approach if you expect to make it configurable after deployment.,2,473
And I'm using the following block of code to invoke the service.,2,490
As the error says.,2,493
So you must change the signature of your method to.,2,494
You can not return any thing.,2,497
It should be solved FILE_NAME 8....,2,506
Delete with a payload works fine in Jersey clients 2.x.x.,2,523
I.e. if there are 4 students in the initial array but only 2 are failing my array is returning: student1 student2 null null.,2,527
My current result when I do a test run in main is.,2,528
You're creating an array that is as long as the original array passed in ( which fills all elements with null ) but not necessarily filling all the slots.,2,529
By default CODE_FRAGMENT sets all parameters on the value stack.,2,551
this is one of the mechanism provides by Struts2 to handle Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ).,2,554
Have a look at.,2,555
Say the fruits are apples oranges mangoes... etc. If the user selects apples I call apples ( ) if he selects mangoes I call mangoes ( ) and so on... To select which function is to be called I Don'T want to use a switch or if-else statements.,2,559
How do I select which function is to be called during run-time?,2,560
NOTE: The programming language I am using is Java.,2,561
Use CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,563
Try using equalsIgnoreCase instead of straight CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,577
Multiple Threads ( Inner classes implementing Runnable ) sharing a Data Structure ( instance variable of the FILE_NAME ).,2,581
Working: took classes from Eclipse project's bin folder ran on a Unix machine.,2,582
I apologize if I missed anything obvious.,2,588
Thanks a lot @maasg... Solution was to add synchronized ( myArrayList ) before I check the size in the Thread 2.,2,589
To access a shared structure in a multi-threaded environment you should use implicit or explicit locking to ensure safe publication and access among threads.,2,590
Using the code above it should look like this.,2,591
Using a concurrent data structure lets you get rid of the synchronized block.,2,595
Check the return of.,2,596
You could also use.,2,600
to ensure the arraylist is always synchronised correctly.,2,601
If I got this right.,2,607
Depending on what you need to accomplish there might be better / other ways to achieve that.,2,620
Based on the stacktrace your output directory is not empty.,2,623
A FILE_NAME name should be used.,2,634
In my main method im parsing the command line arguments like this.,2,641
If I'm now running my programm with the following command.,2,642
Why does it treat this as my output directory?,2,644
I specified another directory as the output directory.,2,645
This should read all files in the single input directory.,2,648
It gives me the `Failed to Create the Java Virtual Machine '.,2,650
Every file has same data which is saved into Employee Table.,2,658
Another option may be the Factory pattern.,2,663
Of course you can combine both.,2,665
You could use a kind of strategy.,2,672
This way you can create new readers for any filetype dynamically.,2,681
Hope it helps.,2,685
You would only need parsers and a successor to each parser.,2,689
In some cases there is a trade that you need to do thus you should take into account your project's requirements.,2,691
Tried just to see the response.,2,698
I am trying to use EqualsBuilder in the apache commons library.,2,706
I have downloaded a few Android applications from Google Play.,2,713
I have got CODE_FRAGMENT code through reverse engineering tool CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,714
Is there any way to generate call graphs automatically?,2,717
thus I tried to write my own tool using Ruby which can be found in here.,2,727
and with WSAddressingFeature enabled.,2,731
Do you have any hints to avoid this error?,2,734
Thank you!,2,739
Gotcha!,2,740
The full story here!,2,744
So if you annotate FILE_NAME only with CODE_FRAGMENT it will not get exported.,2,764
I am trying to figure out how I could make something that looks like a folder file structure for a Java shell I am trying to make.,2,778
I want it to resemble something like the linux folder structure ( having a root and all decending from it ).,2,779
The folders in the tree would be ``server ''objects ( a FILE_NAME ) created by the root ( the FILE_NAME ) which in turn have`` application'' objects ( FILE_NAME ) created by a method in the server object.,2,784
In pre java7 simulating an ``in-memory filesystem ''is fairly complex.,2,794
Find out more.,2,810
How should I encode these 2 parameters to be consistent with what w3schools says is correct ( or is w3schools wrong? ),2,816
Java's CODE_FRAGMENT complies to this RFC with a few caveats mentioned in its Javadoc.,2,819
Trust URI.,2,822
CODE_FRAGMENT type of inputs are not simple attributes they are sent in separate chunk of the request.,2,833
Java library for reading multipart/form-data http body containing multiple files.,2,838
Use FileUtils from Apache commons.,2,841
Using you current code make this tweak.,2,842
You may use the Eclipse's AST parser also in combination.,2,849
I the next best thing I've found so far is to project the byte buffer as a CODE_FRAGMENT and call CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,858
What about CODE_FRAGMENT and calling CODE_FRAGMENT on the returned CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,866
CODE_FRAGMENT is made of CODE_FRAGMENTs not CODE_FRAGMENTs.,2,870
I feel like there should be some way of doing this with the FILE_NAME but I can't figure out a way to use it to get properties from an entity.,2,877
Thanks in advance.,2,879
FILE_NAME is only useful if you are using standard Java beans naming conventions for accessing the properties of your entity.,2,882
What you'll want to do is get the CODE_FRAGMENT of FILE_NAME using the CODE_FRAGMENT method then use the CODE_FRAGMENT method of the CODE_FRAGMENT to retrieve all of the ``getter ''methods of the bean.,2,883
You also do not have to hardcode anything like CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT in your reflective code.,2,886
This example compiles and runs.,2,888
This is what I have so far.,2,893
Then it's up to you to add the relevant code to the method body.,2,895
Add a listener to your ``Submit ''button.,2,897
Note that ``myLabelForShowingTheOutput ''is the JLabel you want to print.,2,898
Is it possible to divide two integers to make and make a BigDecimal out of it?,2,903
I was wondering if it is possible to do something like this.,2,907
In a word no.,2,911
I've a program test to see if the user input is a positive number and an integer.,2,913
Try this.,2,921
Load the PDF into memory and parse the content using a library like iText.,2,924
convert PDF to SVG characters with font size x/y etc. ( PDFBox does this ).,2,934
attempt to interpret the areas as cells of rectangular tables.,2,937
Something like this.,2,944
The answer from @hyde is valid but I have two extra notes that I will point out in the code below.,2,945
Of course it is up to you to re-organize the code to your needs.,2,946
Hibernate related maven conf.,2,948
Suggestions that I found were.,2,949
Regarding your 6 points.,2,954
User hibernate validation 4 +.,2,956
It is integrated in Hibernate 4.,2,959
You do that explicitly but they are also a transitive dependency to hibernate-validator so you would get them either way.,2,967
No that not required/related.,2,968
How do you use all these dependencies?,2,973
That's the whole purpose of GUIDs.,2,976
If your ``GUID ''is a CODE_FRAGMENT then the probabilities are quite low.,2,980
Any ideas?,2,989
Also the compiled library is available by adding the following to API_NAME.,2,1002
And I see lot of demo and sample code about broadcasting with CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,1005
You can try this one: WEB_ADDRESS.,2,1018
It supports API_NAME NUMBER + clients.,2,1020
So to send a message to specific socket all you need is to call CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,1024
Any tip?,2,1030
You could check whether your CODE_FRAGMENT also is an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,1032
thanks in advance.,2,1042
Throw a specific/custom exception and set a specific CODE_FRAGMENT for that.,2,1051
Lastly if you use tomcat you might want to clear the work directory with the temporary compiler outputs of the jsps you created.,2,1061

Has anyone ever tried to connect to a Yahoo Store using Yahoo API calls from Java?,2,1072
I was able to figure this out.,2,1075
Get the path of sd card.,2,1085

Any ideas are appreciated.,2,1094
No-one's picked this up but why are you trying to mock private methods?,2,1107
Why don't you try Easymock or Mockito.,2,1111
jMock mocking based on Hamcrest Matchers.,2,1124
Even Java5's support is going to end in two days ( 30 October 2009 that is! ),2,1128
Here is a code that I have written.,2,1133
When I open the file API_NAME it contains a single line of data.,2,1134
See the documentation of FileWriter.,2,1142
You can't access a private method from an FILE_NAME.,2,1149
Then you can also add additional access paths to the stuff you want.,2,1160
you can use a CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,1166
for problem number two are you adding anyting to the list.,2,1168
Now I was thinking of creating FILE_NAME progress page which would sleep for 5 seconds then generate a request and supply it with the filename that we want to know the progress of.,2,1175
Maybe JavaScript can do the desired actions?,2,1177
Poll the server ( requires a progress API ) periodically ( via javascript ) for the processing status and update the page accordingly when you get a positive result.,2,1180
On the client side you check the progress every few seconds until you see it's finished.,2,1184
You can add an onClickListener to the ImageViews in the FILE_NAME something like this.,2,1191
Hope that helps.,2,1193
to get this index use getElementIdx ( col row ).,2,1199
Here it is.,2,1205
Declare below string FILE_NAME.,2,1206
This video ID will be of next thumbnail which will be flipped.,2,1208
or if your goal is to wrap an existing method that does declare its exception.,2,1212
You can try and do nothing about it.,2,1221
( Come on put at least a CODE_FRAGMENT there - Logging is the best practice here as suggested by @BaileyS. ),2,1224
Only unchecked exception compiler can skip to check.,2,1231
There are 3 things you can do.,2,1240
The short instruction is.,2,1275
Inside eclipse installation folder go to FILE_PATH.,2,1277
Suppose to have an FILE_NAME say CODE_FRAGMENT and two non-abstract subclasses say CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,1281
E.g. I get an array of CODE_FRAGMENT objects.,2,1283
which someone converted to a JSON string as follows.,2,1284
Finally if I try to deserialize as follows.,2,1285
I convert the SVG file into a w3c Document.,2,1294
API_NAME: API_NAME ( ) FILE_NAME / lang/String;.,2,1297
My code is as follows.,2,1298
My dependecies for apache Batik in API_NAME is as follows.,2,1299
documentation of using the DOM api.,2,1302
Currently I'm working on a school project for a Java course.,2,1306
Change the double quotationCODE_FRAGMENT to to a single quote CODE_FRAGMENT like this.,2,1310
That said you should be using prepared statements.,2,1316
I have a project that is using Apache POI and I made sure to include all the external JARs.,2,1321
You will need to provide classpath in Jar file's manifest file.,2,1327
See this official doc.,2,1328
When the CODE_FRAGMENT command fails it's almost always because of one of two things.,2,1335
Make sure FILE_NAME dependencies in your manifest file point to jars relative to FILE_NAME's parent directory.,2,1337
Ensure FILE_NAME contains CODE_FRAGMENT or that your manifest hierarchy points to FILE_NAME that contains FILE_NAME.,2,1339
You should see your CODE_FRAGMENT folder there containing all the required dependencies ( including Apache POI ).,2,1341
About having FILE_NAME dependencies in a separate folder as you suggested that's also possible.,2,1343
Imagine your dependencies where stored in a CODE_FRAGMENT folder outside your CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,1344
It simply adds all the.,2,1346
jars within lib / folder to your classpath.,2,1347
i have found out that i have to read the error log.,2,1351
For testing I've created a.,2,1359
For versions and dependencies please see the API_NAME at the bottom.,2,1369
With Spring 4 it's now possible to use TestPropertySource.,2,1370
In addition to Biju Kunjummen answer.,2,1372
I'm new API_NAME and trying to make a simple client-server app.,2,1374
here is the server code.,2,1375
How to fix it?,2,1377
Look the documentation of InputStream #read ( byte [ ] b ).,2,1381
You should always check the return values of functions for error conditions.,2,1385
In the future study the input and the output of your systems carefully.,2,1395
it can be found here.,2,1409
Good luck!,2,1410
I'm considering making an Android app that integrates OData also.,2,1412
I'm developing a mobile application.,2,1414
I did some modification and in the end it was working but it does not support odata functionallity ( queries like $filter $oderby... ) and for each request I need a new instance.,2,1422
Then I tried my own implementation with CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT classes.,2,1425
So the question is: Is there another library you can recommend that I missed?,2,1427
The mentioned components generate a CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,1432
If you want content use the CODE_FRAGMENT element ( which isn't a void element ).,2,1442
As long as your configuration doesn't change you can create the Session once at the beginning and jsut keep using it.,2,1454
I created a library project exported it to a JAR file and added to the build path of a couple of clients.,2,1472
Important is that you use the right names for packages.,2,1482
They should be unique!,2,1483
I'm using netbeans for FILE_NAME coding.,2,1490
Additionally the CODE_FRAGMENT is never called.,2,1491
Any pointer why this keeps happening.,2,1492
FILE_NAME has a few abstract methods of its own.,2,1513
CODE_FRAGMENT return an instance of type CODE_FRAGMENT which also CODE_FRAGMENT but overrides some of the methods including CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,1518
Then I see that criteriaBuilder don't have method createCriteriaUpdate.,2,1531
Does anyone know how to resolve this problem?,2,1532
You might have both JPA NUMBER and JPA NUMBER persistence jars on the classpath.,2,1533
As per the Java doc.,2,1545

For example date like CODE_FRAGMENT should be converted to 13 February 2013.,2,1714
Using CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,1717
can be found here.,2,1731
I am completely newbie to this topic.,2,1739
My task is the following.,2,1744
Once you have the CODE_FRAGMENT you can get to the CODE_FRAGMENT and the public and private keys.,2,1751
Something along the lines of.,2,1754
You need an RSA key for encryption maybe you can switch your signature algorithm to RSA/SHA1 to avoid the need for two keys.,2,1767
You do not need to do anything special.,2,1769
Can you do something like this were Java is FILE_NAME library.,2,1772
How should I make it to get additional string input such as another user's id?,2,1779
use CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,1780
Using CODE_FRAGMENT;.,2,1786
An example is as follows.,2,1787
I want to list all album list from my picasa album.,2,1789
Please help.,2,1792
i have an arraylist of objects each containing a year/month/day / hour property.,2,1794
Any help appreciated.,2,1825
You can then iterate through each departure element.,2,1835
Here is an example of a row from the timetable.,2,1841
Sorry should've added more.,2,1847
keyboard is what I named the Scanner.,2,1848
This prints ``Press Enter ''to the console and makes sure the input box is empty.,2,1849
If they press Enter it should break the While loop and move onto the next statement right?,2,1850
The CODE_FRAGMENT method will block until it can read a token.,2,1853
When the line is empty it will return an empty string CODE_FRAGMENT not CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,1856
you need to have FILE_NAME in your classpath in order to reslove this.,2,1861
Here is the FILE_NAME.,2,1865
And here is the FILE_NAME.,2,1866
I've separated the loop body into two statements for clarity but it's equivalent to.,2,1871
Your fields should generally be private.,2,1876
Add public ``getter ''methods where necessary.,2,1877
and to declare getters and setters for you fields.,2,1880
And in your constructor If you closeley look.,2,1882
I want it to use id instead.,2,1890
I have the same problem I think it caused by CODE_FRAGMENT's proxy.,2,1892
then you will get CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,1895
You need to inject LocalSessionFactoryBean into ObjectMapper.,2,1906
I resolve it in my branch in github using CODE_FRAGMENT annotation.,2,1909
Is any function or api available to intercept addCookie ( ) so that the cookies set by the servlet will be encrypted using servlet filters.,2,1918
`users' table is located in newly created database.,2,1928
Check the CODE_FRAGMENT library in your project.,2,1931
If you see the source code of this method you will see that.,2,1942
This method is intended to just re-use the existing array and not allocate any memory.,2,1948
The fact that the size constraint and expansion is only related to CODE_FRAGMENT can also be a reason not to add this behaviour to the method.,2,1950
That would just be extra code for the sake of just a particular CODE_FRAGMENT implementation.,2,1951
Here is what the content of FILE_NAME ended up looking like.,2,1967
What kind of a tool can I use to obfuscate/mask away my code similar to NewRelic `FILE_NAME?,2,1970
I want to display only the headers of public functions.,2,1971
JSTL will make the CODE_FRAGMENT tag available which can be used to iterate over you collection.,2,1983
I am working on Spring MVC project in which I need to pass an object from my Controller to JSP and then I need to iterate that object and show them in a table FILE_NAME page.,2,1985
Below is FILE_NAME which holds the data -.,2,1986
Do I need to use JSTL for this?,2,1992
Or there are any better approach for this?,2,1993
We have a Java web application served from Apache Tomcat 6.,2,1994

I am looking to plot cluster heat maps from gene expression data that I have.,2,2013
I used Matthew Beckler's Java Heat Map a while ago.,2,2018
Forgot '' in Create Table Statements.,2,2023
Updated code.,2,2036
use an CODE_FRAGMENT and add a FILE_NAME if not in there already.,2,2049
Regex Explained.,2,2054
CODE_FRAGMENT creates a capturing group to be referenced later.,2,2056
Complexity is O ( N ).,2,2067
You may try like this.,2,2072
I try to split the String ``NUMBER ''to 2 new Strings.,2,2073
but I get a CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,2074
You need to escape dot.,2,2076
you have to use CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,2081
So I thought I could create FILE_NAME that counts and pass the stream through a API_NAME code is in this answer.,2,2086
So my Stream was finally.,2,2088
The stream ( if non parallel ) could be pass sequentially through all the steps ( filter map.,2,2094
Short answer.,2,2097
I suspect that's why the language designers made that decision.,2,2101
Why it technically does not work without CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,2102
Every intermediate operation of CODE_FRAGMENT such as CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT is actually just some kind of setter that initializes the stream's options.,2,2105
This is why CODE_FRAGMENT's argument is evaluated before a single item has gone through the first step of the stream.,2,2107
We want parallel treatment of our items.,2,2111
More detailed answer about why not allow it for non-parallel streams.,2,2114
I finally found my error!,2,2121
You almost certainly have a firewall or anti-virus program blocking your ability to connect.,2,2142
What can be the reason of this warnings?,2,2145

Yes i am using maven.,2,2151
Here is my API_NAME.,2,2152
Add this dependency to your API_NAME.,2,2155
Write to file.,2,2159
My logcat.,2,2161
Let's take a look at the CODE_FRAGMENT method.,2,2164
CODE_FRAGMENT is thrown because CODE_FRAGMENT is CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,2165
If so you should provide CODE_FRAGMENT by yourself at it's constructor.,2,2168
An CODE_FRAGMENT is.,2,2172
I have a Unix command to send email.,2,2174
Please guide me on this problem.,2,2178
Well... no.,2,2185
CODE_FRAGMENT against an object checks for reference equality.,2,2186
That is it checks to see if these two objects are literally the same spot in memory.,2,2187
It depends: which type of equality do you want?,2,2190
Maybe this way... Controller code for the CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,2194
CODE_FRAGMENT is an extension of CODE_FRAGMENT that adds a CODE_FRAGMENT status code.,2,2195
Used in CODE_FRAGMENT as well CODE_FRAGMENT methods.,2,2196
Where Object is FILE_NAME you want.,2,2203
I found work around from this post WEB_ADDRESS.,2,2204
First define an object to hold the entity coming back in the array.,2,2206
Then you can consume the service and get a strongly typed list via.,2,2209
Is there a best practices in using bower with a web application such that the application isn't bloated with unnecessary third-party library files?,2,2217
From the articles I read I kind of get the following.,2,2220
for which you can specify the target directory.,2,2226
If we move forward with this this is what I envision.,2,2228
If you're interested I have more to add ( since there's not a lot out there about this topic )... We are currently using maven ``js ''artifacts so we can leverage maven's dependency management with our 3rd party js.,2,2229
2 ) Create `bower_components' folder outside of your src folder.,2,2240
3 ) Edit API_NAME configuration file ( in the `bower_component's folder ) and specify path for each js library components.,2,2241
I have a native library that I call using JNI.,2,2254
A few notes.,2,2260
See NativeSystem.,2,2265
Its always fun when you have concurrent applications extracting different versions of your naive library to the same location and filename.,2,2269
Use API_NAME ( ) instead of API_NAME ( ) to load the extracted binaries.,2,2270
Quite contrary on Windows.,2,2272
Check out the documentation for the CODE_FRAGMENT here or.,2,2284
It will read a byte each time here.,2,2287
Quote taken from the CODE_FRAGMENT documentation.,2,2290
After that the UI thread CODE_FRAGMENT receives the message inside the CODE_FRAGMENT method.,2,2292
and acts accordingly to the message received and displays the message in your CODE_FRAGMENT of choice.,2,2293
On a sidenote.,2,2295
CODE_FRAGMENT Terminates the current line by writing the line separator string.,2,2312
This method behaves as though it invokes print ( String ) and then println ( ).,2,2315
Note that the byte is written as given; to write a character that will be translated according to the platform's default character encoding use the print ( char ) or println ( char ) methods.,2,2322
Edit: - Missed to add one imp line CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,2323
As to your point.,2,2343
The CODE_FRAGMENT will take care of the rest.,2,2349
That shouldn't be an issue though.,2,2353
It is possible to pass VM flags to expand this range too.,2,2363
Just changing the map's value externally does not reorder the priority queue.,2,2365
You will have to remove ( ) and add ( ) the Object whose ``score ''changed for it to move to its new position in the queue.,2,2366
And then for FILE_NAME we have.,2,2380
Examples of FILE_NAME names include.,2,2382
Otherwise the absolute name is of the following form.,2,2386
modified_package_name / name.,2,2387
Hope this helps anyone out there!,2,2397
WEB_ADDRESS #setString% API_NAME% API_NAME% 29.,2,2403
Example ( 35 degrees ): WEB_ADDRESS.,2,2415
I have modified your code to add them.,2,2418
Please refer to the code below.,2,2421
I am using the appcompat_v7 project as a library project in eclipse.,2,2423
And my Gradle File looks like this.,2,2425
where CODE_FRAGMENT is your CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,2430
If you include the appcompat lib as you do above you don't need to include support-v4 at all; appcompat depends on it and the build system will do the right thing.,2,2432
So go ahead and remove FILE_NAME from your libs folder.,2,2433
I have chosen this as a recurring pattern throughout the project.,2,2435
InsertandRetriveBlobData.,2,2437
Starting with the socket IO since Java 7 the NIO API has been available which means you can leave the threading required to prevent blocking the main thread to the OS.,2,2456
You might also want to look at an API like Netty which I believe saves you from having to write logic to re-construct messages.,2,2461
Once you have a complete message you need to process it.,2,2463
Each node in the network sends periodically updated data from sensors ( voltage current temperature etc. ).,2,2470
I start a new Thread for handling each remote object.,2,2471
Maybe try put your data into BlockingQueue and in main thread take data.,2,2475
this is FILE_NAME to read your data from BlockingQueue.,2,2477
So i created this from scratch.,2,2480
and of course API_NAME.,2,2482
it will tell from where to pickup the root-API_NAME.,2,2490
What am I missing???,2,2493
However you can find the documentation in the OpenJDK source itself.,2,2495
It's documentation can be found here.,2,2497
a way to get FILE_NAME type thread group or maybe just the priority of the interrupting.,2,2506
In a word: No.,2,2519
What happens if a thread is interrupted multiple times by different threads?,2,2522
Which one should be reported?,2,2523
You probably to build your own event mechanism in which the events carry the information you need with them.,2,2526
Using this i am able to generate an encrypted text but the PHP server is not able to decrypt my encrypted text.,2,2531

I am using API_NAME for encoding.,2,2538
Working Python Code.,2,2540
I'm looking for a well-maintained Java bytecode manipulation library with an intuitive API.,2,2541
Take a look at this article.,2,2556
Maybe you could do the same that he did i.e. explicitly declare rc05 version of Guava to force maven to use this one?,2,2579
( see: this answer ).,2,2580
how do i map FILE_NAME to set the values and create a different json with the same format?,2,2583
There is no exact equivalent of a CODE_FRAGMENT in JDBC.,2,2602
I am specifically referring to InputStream ( Java SE ) and its implementations.,2,2604
How is blocking performed?,2,2605
No they don't use busy-waiting.,2,2608
It's up to the implementation ( which will depend on the kind of input stream you're using ) but generally it's likely to use a blocking OS-level API so the efficiency will depend on the OS.,2,2609
the exception is on line 72 and 114.,2,2611
Please not that in the above code CODE_FRAGMENT method will close not only the CODE_FRAGMENT object itself but also its underlining stream ( i.e. keyboard input ).,2,2613
This means you've picked up a version built against Hadoop 1.x hence the FILE_NAME vs interface exception.,2,2628
One which is the Pro full API.,2,2635
I see some mention of ``flavours ''on the net but seems all the hits are to do with Android development and properties.,2,2637
When you build you can publish the binaries for both pro and lite to your artifact repository ( nexus artifactory etc ) and then you would have 2 separate jars.,2,2641
A single Gradle project can produce any number of JARs.,2,2643
You could simply add another Jar task and give it a unique classifier to distinguish it from the ``standard ''library.,2,2644
Say I have a input field which will only accept a CODE_FRAGMENT when the submit button is pressed.,2,2645
You'll need to customize the formatter's CODE_FRAGMENT method since NumberFormat normally ignores trailing characters.,2,2650
What I would like to do take any random XML and create object which will contain timestamps integers strings as well maps basically it would be all decomposed based on the XML structure.,2,2661
Is there better way than to do it manually?,2,2665
Component scan configuration file.,2,2683
In a FILE_NAME code base in my recent job I see the below code.,2,2689
Are there examples you have that could shed light on the above MapHelper's usefulness?,2,2691
you could use.,2,2695
See also `Is there a Java equivalent or methodology for the typedef keyword in C++? ',2,2700
They appear to have foresight about what the Map contains.,2,2703
There are some examples like this in the Java API such as.,2,2710
Does anyone know what the C# equivalents would be for the methods shown above?,2,2722
XmlWriter forward-only xml stream generator.,2,2724
The API_NAME file code is.,2,2730
When i run this API_NAME their shows only the labels and No button aor text field.,2,2732
Wrong JSF tags.,2,2734
In order to avoid such problems in future you'd better use some IDE ( e.g. Netbeans IDE or Intellij IDEA ).,2,2741
Use CDI's CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT or JSF's CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,2744
You must capitalize the first letter of the property in the getter/setter so instead of.,2,2759
Second: you are mixing CODE_FRAGMENT ( instantiation through JSF ) with CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,2762
Older versions of JSF used instantiation through JSF and you should be using CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,2763
Also to note when asking questions usually it is worth stating which version of JSF/server/J2EE you are using ( without such information we can not tell you which annotations you should use ).,2,2765
Do i need to use event mechanism?,2,2770
Use CODE_FRAGMENT instead and get this string from a CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,2775
Check here for an example which returns a String.,2,2776
Like this.,2,2777
If you insist using CODE_FRAGMENT you can try the below 2 ways.,2,2779
Can anyone please help me out with this.,2,2786
Hoping to get an alternate approach or a small overview of AnchorPane constraints.,2,2797
Note: I'm new to JavaFX graphics library.,2,2798
running CODE_FRAGMENT isn't enough running CODE_FRAGMENT after inserting the dependency solved it for me.,2,2806
I would like to keep that original window open throughout when the user is using the File Chooser and after.,2,2809
The file chooser's parent was the main window.,2,2812

You absolutly need to be compiling FILE_NAME JRE NUMBER!!,2,2828
I created the simplest possible android app which starts the RegisterActivity generated by the plugin where I did plug the ID Api Key and project number.,2,2832
I then click on the button but I get this error message.,2,2833
Although the console tells me that there is one instance up and running and the LOCAL_ANDROID_RUN variable in FILE_NAME is set to false.,2,2834
How is that possible and what can I be doing wrong?,2,2836
Thank you a lot in advance.,2,2837
The same number is: 2.,2,2845
Use this logic it will work for consecutive same values otherwise use ArrayList.,2,2855
drl file for creating new rules and modifying rules.,2,2880
What exists for programmatically creating new rules from Java?,2,2881
I don't know if this is the `accepted 'way but with the following code I comine CODE_FRAGMENT files with programmatically created rules in Drools 6.,2,2883
The following comment is found at the Java documentation.,2,2886
Adding API_NAME ( ) after awaitTermination ( ) method call can provide a delay which can get you the output you were looking for.,2,2896
I took help from this Question.,2,2897
System prints data like this.,2,2901
If not I just wanted to know if Java serializes objects that haven't been initialized yet.,2,2910
So basically you write primitives ( e.g. CODE_FRAGMENT ) or objects ( CODE_FRAGMENT ) with the CODE_FRAGMENT and then you read them back using the CODE_FRAGMENT with the corresponding CODE_FRAGMENT-methods.,2,2914
You can try use byte [ ] instead of String object.,2,2918
Each String object contains set of UTF-16 chars.,2,2920
It means 2-bytes per symbol in most case.,2,2921
UTF-8 encoding uses one byte for ASCII two bytes for many europe languages.,2,2922
Also each String object contains reference to char array.,2,2923
So you can easy reduce count of objects by factor two ( one byte [ ] instead of pair String + char [ ] ) and array length of UTF-8 symbols usually less than length of UTF-16 chars.,2,2926
And then in your other file.,2,2941
Assuming that the only issue you're having is the name of the dependent library see CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,2948
But this library has a dependency to other native library which cames bundled with the API_NAME.,2,2951
In the debug outputs of JNA i can see only the API_NAME will extract from FILE_NAME package.,2,2959
I have looked to the JNA code of the extraction method.,2,2963
Please see attached cause exception.,2,2983
You don't you get Neo4j cross-compiled to the client you have to run Neo4j as part of your backend service.,2,2988
You can look at the readme document on Github repository to get started.,2,2994
Sample code on working with blob can also be found in the repository here.,2,2995
I am using Android Studio.,2,2997
The logcat is as below.,2,3002
Can anyone tell me where I am going wrong?,2,3003
FILE_NAME project is called Osmosis and contains 2 packages search and common.,2,3007
My API_NAME seems to include the reference.,2,3015
Add CODE_FRAGMENT after your other two CODE_FRAGMENT lines in your CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,3020
As well I am adding a set amount of Labels using an array and a for loop.,2,3029
I have tried using both a VBox and an HBox but I am not able to see a difference in my result.,2,3031
I have also tried to use.,2,3032
( In this case I would have used.,2,3037
Quick fix is to make the VBox as the parent of the StackPane.,2,3050
so how we can parse above like example expression easier or FILE_NAME api for string parser.,2,3055
This uses ByteBuffer's CODE_FRAGMENT method.,2,3076
Now I want this when the user check a shipper by EditTextView I have from database an Object.,2,3080
I want insert the information of this object in the Fragment.,2,3081
Now in the onCreate method I have insert in all tab the FILE_NAME but I will to create three FILE_NAME for the three tabs.,2,3082
So instead of setting Bundle to null you can do something like this.,2,3084
Check out this link for more info.,2,3085
I did not remove sunpkcs # 11 provider after each API_NAME (... ) call.,2,3099
This exception is not because of absence of SunPkcs11 because i see the SunPkcs11 that i added in the providers list.,2,3106
I'm new to FILE_NAME language.,2,3107
In Java you typically don't write a single method that handle all sorts of arguments with all sorts of different types.,2,3126
Autoboxing is syntactic sugar. ),2,3135
If you want to implement a dynamic binding between names ( strings ) and values in Java use a FILE_NAME.,2,3145
So just use CODE_FRAGMENT instead of CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,3163
When I perform CODE_FRAGMENT request to CODE_FRAGMENT I get following JSON.,2,3193
I `am using library CODE_FRAGMENT for work with CODE_FRAGMENT file's.,2,3212
Then you can do what you want with the Collection: sort it loop through it create a Comparator etc..,2,3224
I was thinking of creating a new JSONArray object and copy node which contains Carlos.,2,3232
You'll need to use a regex for for the CODE_FRAGMENT path expression.,2,3238
I am doing a small project it is a interoperability FILE_NAME and.,2,3250
The program is just a hello world Program.,2,3256
You create a reference type by prefixing FILE_NAME declaration with CODE_FRAGMENT keyword.,2,3267
CODE_FRAGMENT is what you use to create an object in managed heap.,2,3269
( Note that nodes may have multiple style classes though I have never understood why this is a CODE_FRAGMENT rather than a CODE_FRAGMENT. ),2,3282
Finally ID Selectors work by specifying an id on the node.,2,3288
So you can do.,2,3290
One last note: you mentioned that your line ``lacked API_NAME ''.,2,3294
The code in Java is.,2,3300
What you need is to assign data to a string read from the stream.,2,3302
This is a question just to satisfy my curiosity.,2,3321
Consider the following two Java regular expressions: CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,3322
Are they equivalent?,2,3323
I went on and assumed you meant to quantify it as greedy hence the CODE_FRAGMENT in my example instead of non-quantified CODE_FRAGMENT in your question.,2,3340
They are equivalent when you use them as is with CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,3341
I like working with eclipse better than Android Studio.,2,3346
So I first tried to compile the sweet-alert-dialog project and I found out that I need to first somehow include the materialish-progress.,2,3352
Try to download *.,2,3359
May be some resources will need to be copied from archives too.,2,3361
Let me know if there are any other details that might help!,2,3368
Dug this up: WEB_ADDRESS.,2,3370
Guess I'll be trying to find a creative workaround in the meantime... The proximate cause of the failure is that there are more than 5 levels of subdirectories under.,2,3372
Provide path from src or bin to file location ( Running from eclipse ).,2,3389
For more Information: WEB_ADDRESS.,2,3393
I needed to write a program which adds binary numbers as if they were decimal.,2,3395
If you want to print a int as binary use CODE_FRAGMENT to get the string representation of a CODE_FRAGMENT in binary.,2,3407
Version of Spring is NUMBER.,2,3409
I have a session bean declared as.,2,3410
After debugging i found out that when test spring context is started in the.,2,3413
You can add a util method to your test something like.,2,3422
In production I would assume that you are configuring either a CODE_FRAGMENT or a CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,3426
See JIRA issue SPR-13217 for details.,2,3429
However having said that if you have a concrete need for modifying the mock request created by CODE_FRAGMENT manually and then having that re-used with CODE_FRAGMENT you can create the FILE_NAME in your project.,2,3432
Obviously the above example re-implements CODE_FRAGMENT but you can naturally do the same for CODE_FRAGMENT etc..,2,3435
Sam ( author of the Spring TestContext Framework ).,2,3438
And DispatherConfig is this.,2,3445
Let's assume that we have a for-loop that will loop through a collection or array of Strings.,2,3446
hey ) here's how I usually achieve that.,2,3448
Let's put your code inside a method.,2,3453
If you use CODE_FRAGMENT the loop will terminate and CODE_FRAGMENT will be reached.,2,3454
If you know the word can only be found once you can surely place an break; statement so the loop won't continue after finding the match.,2,3457
The application is a Spring/Hibernate webApp which access the Oracle database.,2,3462
This was configured in an API_NAME as follows.,2,3463
Question is of course: what is a solution to use the result of Oracle function for the new value of the ID?,2,3464
Edit: To call an Oracle function from Java see if this works for you.,2,3468
Call Java Oracle Functions From Java program and see the Java CallableStatement API.,2,3469
When I run this on Windows the console tells me.,2,3472
Does CODE_FRAGMENT work?,2,3484
Note however it's called CODE_FRAGMENT with a capital D.,2,3487
Question 2: From the javadoc.,2,3492
So yes you need to keep track of the position yourself.,2,3493
But when I run this json through CODE_FRAGMENT I see that CODE_FRAGMENT been replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,3502
What happens if a thread has been executed same time more than once.,2,3510
Something like below.,2,3514
Hope it clarifies.,2,3524
I have to fetch time stamp from DB and retrieve only time and compare two time.,2,3539
Which outputs.,2,3548
I have a string like this.,2,3553
Now i want to translate the string FILE_NAME entity decoder.,2,3554
url WEB_ADDRESS.,2,3556
is there FILE_NAME api to translate it?,2,3557
I'm using it to convert huge lists of strings with HTML entities in them back to normal strings.,2,3564
And I got the output like this.,2,3568
mm stands for minutes.,2,3577
So using... It outputs CODE_FRAGMENT for me.,2,3584
Accourding to this answer.,2,3589
IS there any way so that I can open using the code itself.,2,3592
and call the client as follows.,2,3596
The `API_NAME 'property represents an estimate of the number of words in the Word document.,2,3598
API_NAME updates this property when you call `API_NAME 'method.,2,3599
Please see the following sample code.,2,3600
en-dash & em-dash word count differs from MS-Office.,2,3605
Hi I have a sample log file here.,2,3616
The API_NAME ( String regex.,2,3630
You need to encapsulate the regex pattern in quotes.,2,3632
The line that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT method should look something like this.,2,3634
To stop this runnable you have to call this when needed.,2,3656
And a string contains the name of the enum.,2,3661
You have to do it like this.,2,3665
Here's an alternative way.,2,3666
Remember you should use FULLY QUALIFIED CLASSNAME.,2,3669
Here is the actual data sent.,2,3683
I think you also have to look at the database configuration.,2,3703
The package gets deleted in the registry.,2,3709
install4j transforms entered package names to path names so ''.'',2,3719
Using FILE_NAME I can do something like this.,2,3730
Any suggestion for a better design would be appreciated.,2,3737

FILE_NAME is instantiated inside an ItemProcessor bean ( spring batch ).,2,3752
Let's say that I have an Android library that has FILE_NAME Foo in it.,2,3753
You can also retrieve the item by calling API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') and it will return the item associated with Test1.,2,3755
In App 2 if I call API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') will I get a null pointer exception or will I get 1?,2,3758
I am not sure exactly how static classes in included libraries work scope wise.,2,3759
I am curious about the problem I have proposed.,2,3761
Thank you in advance!,2,3768
That being said the JARs you see there only support JPA not core Hibernate.,2,3772
But i didn't give me the thing i need!,2,3780
How can i do that?,2,3781

I have integrated sonarQube for code analysis.,2,3797
What do I need to change about the way I package my app so it can just use the latest Java?,2,3811
You should use a CODE_FRAGMENT for this task.,2,3824
If so then how far does this go; for example could a static final field be accessed by one thread before it's been initialized by another?,2,3844
I'm trying to compile a tool which uses apache ant on linux.,2,3847
I also have set JAVA_HOME.,2,3851
Use full path in ANT_HOME eg.,2,3855

Thanks and Greeting!,2,3865
So the question is.,2,3872
If you are using a PaaS ( like Heroku ) they usually provide a way to setup environment variables using their interface.,2,3887
This way this variable get configured in every instance you use.,2,3888
try this type code.,2,3894
In the CODE_FRAGMENT listener we can determine which button was clicked.,2,3899
and call this at every button: ( saves you the setOnClickListener ).,2,3901
If you add a method to do the CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT you can reduce the lines for each button from two to one.,2,3905
If you need to shorten the button code Use View's in OnClick ( ) with help of switch statement.,2,3907
Create the number of buttons that you want with different button id.,2,3909
You can use syntax like.,2,3915
I am trying to write missed responses to an external text file.,2,3916

The code i am using is.,2,3963
Assume you have this directory layout.,2,3966
What's happening?,2,3983
I've also verified previous GC logs and found that this issue was not forever.,2,3992
It started about a month ago after a deployment.,2,3993
CODE_FRAGMENT informs Java VM when CMS should be triggered.,2,4001
As part of GC first minor GC is triggered.,2,4004
I have found one more related SE question: CMS garbage collector - when does it run?,2,4007
So there are a few possible causes to your woes and I'll state the likely quick fix first and then state some best practices below that you should consider doing in the long term.,2,4013
You should be able to do this by adding the parameter CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,4018
Also based on what I can see from Stas' blog entry on the subject the unit is milliseconds not seconds.,2,4020
Try these longer term things in the long term.,2,4021
If you can try the G1GC collector.,2,4022
You are using Java 7 so if you can in your current environment give it a try.,2,4023
It's meant for performance with big heaps.,2,4024
Remember the bigger the heap the longer the garbage collector takes irrespective of whether you are using a concurrent collector such as CMS.,2,4030
You have a lot of tuning parameters and I would challenge that you need the majority of them.,2,4031
Here is the FILE_NAME implementation.,2,4038
At first we need to check that type is actually inherits from CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,4043
You can achieve everything @Vadim Martynov's answer does with an additional type parameter and additional type constraints and still receive compile-time verification.,2,4046
One way would be.,2,4047
FILE_NAME does one thing and does it well.,2,4050
( If you're not using Java 8 it's easy enough to write a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes an existing one and a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes two existing ones. ),2,4052
You can also use Java 8's static methods in CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,4054
Thanks alot!,2,4060

And here is how you can get back the term vectors from ES.,2,4264
To get the terms we parse the TermsVectorResponse as follows.,2,4266
Why not?,2,4274
What you probably want is CODE_FRAGMENT which returns CODE_FRAGMENT if the cursor is not at the beginning of the result set OR if the result set is empty.,2,4277
It isn't not at least at JPA level.,2,4278
This triggers a CODE_FRAGMENT on other tables/entities.,2,4283
( note: CODE_FRAGMENT is my JPA implementation ).,2,4284
Currently I have a method.,2,4292
The reason I do not want to have method to accept Reader is that I want my own method to have own control to decide what type of encoding should be used.,2,4293
CODE_FRAGMENT is just going to close the stream ( via a CODE_FRAGMENT in fact - at least in the JDK 6 implementation ).,2,4307
There's basically nothing to clean up apart from the input stream and structures in memory... the GC will take care of the memory so you're done.,2,4310
All of that can just go.,2,4313
I have set up the Interface as follows.,2,4327
where mOut is an ActivityInterface.,2,4330
If I make the toString method static I get a different error in the FILE_NAME.,2,4332
Remember to have a CODE_FRAGMENT clause.,2,4341
That is why it says ``Non-static method toString ( int int ) can not be referenced from a static context '' because you are trying to access a method which is not static in a static way.,2,4353
Also you need not need SimpleDateFormat to increment calendar details.,2,4358

When you add 3 hours you will get March 30 2010 02:00 UTC.,2,4568
Precisely at March 30 2010 01:00 UTC we switch time from +1 hour to +2 hours versus UTC so March 30 2010 00:59 UTC is March 30 2010: 01:59 CEST but March 30 2010 01:00 UTC become March 30 2010 03:00 CEST.,2,4572
In a week you can expect another ``fun ''.,2,4575
That's exactly why you should always store date and times in relation to UTC and convert them to local time zone before displaying otherwise you risk an ambiguity.,2,4580
Here is an example ( please note that March 30th 2008 is Daylight Saving change in Italy ).,2,4583
When I sum 3 hours to my midnight I get 04:00:00!,2,4588
Where is my mistake?,2,4590
I recommend that you change the way you store your day and use a date.,2,4600
You might do something like this.,2,4602
Omitted time zone.,2,4613
Should have been translated to UTC time.,2,4615
Like this: CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,4619
No Midnight.,2,4620
Some comments about this source code.,2,4624
Note that the time zone ( for Rome ) is specified.,2,4626
EAR dependencies.,2,4647
The datasource should load from jndi this is my API_NAME.,2,4648
And I've added these settings to the WebMvc FILE_NAME.,2,4653
i am making application that have scroll listener that add data from multiple URL.,2,4659
You are setting adapter eveytime after executing doInBackground.,2,4666
I want to ask some questions.,2,4671
( My question is here how to list the music on JScrollPane?? ),2,4677
If i double click each music ( sample1 sample2 ) the music that I choose is playing.,2,4679
I want the music's name that I choose.,2,4682
like sample1 sample2 so I can play the music like FILE_PATH format is FILE_PATH how to get that music name?? ),2,4684
I want to use JSONArray FILE_NAME.,2,4689
But you should have written.,2,4699
I'm FILE_NAME NUMBER on Tomcat 7.,2,4700
I can send POST request with this code.,2,4701
Use copyOfRange method API_NAME.,2,4713
startIndex is the initial index of the range to be copied inclusive.,2,4714
To get negative values working as well you could make a helper method for this.,2,4717
Doesn't a for loop work exactly like the slice operator in python.,2,4726
This is a list in python.,2,4727
This is how the slice operator would work.,2,4728
OutputRaw solve me issue.,2,4746
I have page FILE_NAME / tml ).,2,4747
Page contain also other components: grid textarea and etc..,2,4749
So variable contain CODE_FRAGMENT CODE_FRAGMENT CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,4752
The output that I get is -.,2,4761
The statement should have been.,2,4770
Here is what I have now.,2,4779
Edit: Thank you everyone for the help!,2,4780
ASCII codes... Characters are understood as integers in the above code ( e.g. CODE_FRAGMENT is 65 ).,2,4783
That said you have a couple options.,2,4788
You could write a Matcher that only accepts alphabetic characters.,2,4789
This would look like.,2,4793
I am using batik library to create pdf document from svg file.,2,4795
Single page export is limitation of this library used to export PDFs and currently page size is simply increased to accommodate more data.,2,4796
Just delete the method.,2,4814
CODE_FRAGMENTs have default CODE_FRAGMENT methods that do as you expect.,2,4815
Just delete the instance variable CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,4817
Choose an appropriate locale ( or leave out the two locale arguments to use the computer's defaut ).,2,4823
I cant use Date format only string.,2,4826
Spring AOP provides an option on proxy via FILE_NAME @EnableAspectJAutoProxy ( proxyTargetClass = true ).,2,4835
But I used AspectJ loadtime weaving.,2,4842
More details in thread.,2,4843
In my case I simply excluded the jaxb-impl that came with camel-jaxb and the application started working correctly.,2,4848
The FILE_NAME ( NUMBER ) is coming from camel-jaxb in my app so it seems very contained and not like this answer suggests.,2,4859
Netbeans with JAXB Random ClassCastException.,2,4863
can not be cast to API_NAME.,2,4865
The final CODE_FRAGMENT should look like.,2,4873
---------------------------- ^ should be replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT and appended to the whole string.,2,4874
I've read a bit and tried out some of the libraries which were pointed out here such as Velocity and FreeMarker.,2,4875
The only thing to take in account is that templates must be staticly generated ( in order to be processed at compile-time ).,2,4883
I have 2D closed vector paths specified in SVG paths-like syntax - i.e. these paths include straight lines and various Bezier curves.,2,4885
I expect to do a system when you can do a survey and then press a button open a new activity and see survey answers.,2,4905
Here is my code of the survey XML and JAVA.,2,4908
like this just capture all user input data No need for the database in this.,2,4913
Here list is the list of all question you are having....,2,4914
getQuestion and similarly with answer.,2,4916
I have a CODE_FRAGMENT starting alongside with app.,2,4918
In this situation when I click on the greyed out widget I need to start the app.,2,4924
how I could achieve this.,2,4926
You may want to check CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,4930
Your showFields method needs to traverse FILE_NAME hierarchy something like this.,2,4948
Note that I used CODE_FRAGMENT not CODE_FRAGMENT because the latter only processes public fields.,2,4949
Let's assume my model looks like this.,2,4953
I'm using CODE_FRAGMENT with a jackson and I was wondering if there is any better way to build a list of building an expanded version of this list than first calling then list method and then foreaching over all the Ids calling the detail resources and appending the result to a list.,2,4957
Unlikely - Redis' PubSub messages are Strings/Byte streams.,2,4961
Plese guide.,2,4966
Input SAD_FACETotalDigits Required NaturalNumberToBeFormatted ).,2,4967
Targetting to achieve.,2,4968
You can use CODE_FRAGMENT with a dynamically created format string e.g. input CODE_FRAGMENT should become CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,4969
If you prefer using a CODE_FRAGMENT you can call CODE_FRAGMENT to get the desired result.,2,4970
New information shows that a partial cross-join of the data is desired.,2,4984
Store them in memory in a CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,4990
Optionally replacing the CODE_FRAGMENT with the actual processing logic.,2,4996
Thread 2 iterates CODE_FRAGMENT and finds matching records by calling CODE_FRAGMENT iterating the submap giving matching CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT records to thread 3 for processing.,2,5003
Hmmm.,2,5016
But shouldn't it be (... | | fromIndex > = toIndex )?,2,5027
So you can see since CODE_FRAGMENT exception is not thrown.,2,5030
Can you help in understanding this code.,2,5034
Looks like it is getting timezone As an off-set from GMT in hours.,2,5035
In the code you referenced readLine is called on a BufferedReader.,2,5056
An InputStream or a Reader is where you read your input from.,2,5061
The CODE_FRAGMENT / CODE_FRAGMENT classes and subclasses are for reading / writing character-based data.,2,5063
In your particular example the code is asymmetric because the HTTP service it designed to talk to is asymmetric.,2,5071
Here's an example of a JSON structure.,2,5078
Here it's the function that parses the json.,2,5079
I've a JSON structure which is fully dynamic I don't always know what structure will come from it.,2,5082
Can I use a recursive function?,2,5087
Here's a question about what's the difference between them: Gson Type Adapter vs. Custom Deseralizer.,2,5093
Consider the following interface.,2,5113
Due to type erasure it will have a method CODE_FRAGMENT on the byte code level.,2,5114
Now consider the following FILE_NAME.,2,5115
Avoid legacy date-time classes.,2,5122
The CODE_FRAGMENT has a resolution up to nanoseconds.,2,5129
Instead use API_NAME classes.,2,5133
When you get your CODE_FRAGMENT immediately convert to API_NAME types.,2,5135
In the ThreeTen-Backport library for Java 6 & 7 use CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,5137
An CODE_FRAGMENT is a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds.,2,5138
API_NAME framework is built into Java 8 and later.,2,5141
To learn more see the Oracle Tutorial.,2,5144
Specification is JSR 310.,2,5146
Can anyone told me how to compare this two in best practice?,2,5161
Use it.,2,5165
You probably mean.,2,5168
e.g. see WEB_ADDRESS.,2,5172
I am using a regex that would basically regex for the following URL.,2,5173
The regex is.,2,5174
I am using this.,2,5176
You can use this regex.,2,5184
You are missing CODE_FRAGMENT for that your patter not match because it contain more than one character or number.,2,5185
If so please show an example.,2,5196
What is best practice while testing Android Services?,2,5203
After configure FILE_NAME to handle the payment process following the instructions from here I run my application and try checkout an order with paypal.,2,5208
I have this CODE_FRAGMENT file provided below.,2,5218
I took several measures.,2,5220
What should I do to solve the issue?,2,5223
I want to check those http request/response pairs against mod-security rules for auditing-purposes.,2,5225
How can I detect a USB device plug in and out ( kind of listening ) with Java?,2,5233
Is this due to a technical limitation for sub-pixel AA in general or a bug in Java or just because Java doesn't even try for translucent text or have I missed something?,2,5257
Graphics Initialization.,2,5258
I think its because your using GASP which takes the points from the font style.,2,5260
See here.,2,5267
url: WEB_ADDRESS.,2,5275
I've given an example below.,2,5284
There are several options.,2,5293
Otherwise you can enable eager fetching for particular query.,2,5295
Since that time we've tended more toward option two.,2,5317
I will post it here if I find anything new.,2,5322
But I want to connect this mobile application to the IIS server.,2,5325
you can create webservice and deploy it over IIS and consume it from j2me app /.,2,5333
and the callback expected takes a parameter of a record.,2,5339
There are one caveat with the use of callbacks in JNA.,2,5342
This is especially true for long lived callbacks.,2,5344
Otherwise it is important to have the callback instance deregister itself in it's finalize method.,2,5347
Here is the code that does the push.,2,5359
Here is the Tomcat 6 LOG ( it sends to subscriberID '99' ).,2,5365
For the records I found it ;o).,2,5370
For deails see Adobe forums thread.,2,5372
Enjoy and thank you for your time!,2,5374
FILE_NAME files are either bz2 or gz.,2,5378
Or simply use Maven repository.,2,5392
Select the JRE that is used for your projects and hit edit.,2,5394
Add other jars from your JDK.,2,5395
All projects will see the changed JRE definition.,2,5397
See details of this method here: WEB_ADDRESS #API_NAME.,2,5437
( And please reformat your code ).,2,5438
The customer is sleeping while he gets his massage.,2,5446
The customer leaves the salon.,2,5448
If there aren't any the masseur goes to bed again.,2,5450
I have FILE_NAME MassageSalon.,2,5454
You could use a fair Semaphore called NotSleeping.,2,5463
As long as the customer does not enter the saloon it holds NotSleeping.,2,5464
Here's an example.,2,5480
In both cases the BigDecimal shows me what the number is that it holds.,2,5484
Use FILE_NAME instead of float.,2,5489
And use Java code like this.,2,5490
I wouldn't use CODE_FRAGMENT I suggest using CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or ( if you have to ) CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,5491
If you mean ``direct ''ByteBuffers there's a put method which accepts other CODE_FRAGMENT instances so you can copy around.,2,5498
For direct and heap byte buffers CODE_FRAGMENT uses the CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT methods.,2,5500
How can i solve it.,2,5505
Until you create an object and assign it to the variable holding a reference to it the value of that variable is CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,5509
Well you didn't do that for CODE_FRAGMENT object CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,5512
You have to new it up.,2,5517
Since you are using CODE_FRAGMENT this will help.,2,5519
I have registered some CellEditors with all my columns.,2,5523
The FILE_NAME looks like this.,2,5525
Check if your Table has that style bit.,2,5537
I added.,2,5539
Here is an example in Java.,2,5548
To get HTTP Response code FILE_NAME.,2,5551
Now you can write your Selenium WebDriver code as below.,2,5552
After the request is done all you have to do is get and iterate the Perfomance logs and find ``API_NAME ''for the requested url.,2,5559
The output looks like this.,2,5561
When that is ready I shall post the code.,2,5563
An usage example.,2,5565
While I would expect.,2,5582
To register the bean try calling: CODE_FRAGMENT and pass a CODE_FRAGMENT you filled.,2,5593
Session scope population can be done ( ideally using a CODE_FRAGMENT ) using.,2,5613
In a similar manner you can populate the request scope ( ideally done in a filter ) using.,2,5615
my beans are destroyed How on startup I can get the same bean registered.,2,5635
As of JUnit there shouldnt be a dependency for your build right?,2,5637
I Add Junit >> > right click on project - > properties - > Java Build Path - > libraries - > add library.,2,5640
Warning is -.,2,5643
My code follows.,2,5653
Use the SVN Kit library instead.,2,5657
So in other words it would be a bug to recieve a non workday in this example.,2,5683
Store the valid strings in a CODE_FRAGMENT and decide whether a string is a valid day or not based on CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,5684
Let me know if you need more details.,2,5692
I know its an old post but I believe following result will be still interesting.,2,5700
The table below shows time required by simple loop and CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,5702
I'm working with a program that runs lengthy SQL queries and stores the processed results in a HashMap.,2,5708
May be it's worth to limit the 1st level of caching by just 50 reports and introduce a 2nd level based on WeakHashMap?,2,5720
I have a requirement to modify the templates at rumtime.,2,5724
There is a dynamic templating component that is moving from the tapx component library to core Tapestry in NUMBER.,2,5726
Here is a brief description of it.,2,5728
A small description of application is as follow.,2,5732
The application is basically an object manager where user add new object remove old objects and connect object with each other.,2,5733
What Left.,2,5738
cricle and fill that with red.,2,5744
However I'd suggest using a graph visualization library like JUNG etc..,2,5752
Using this you'd basically only have to define your object graph.,2,5753
can someone help me how to do this with a piece of code.,2,5761
Thanks in advance to everyone.,2,5777
You have to add FILE_NAME file using eclipse's interface.,2,5779
This website shows how.,2,5780
I had what I believe the same issue is.,2,5789
I found that I needed to adjust the Apache configuration to include a ServerName or ServerAlias for the host.,2,5790
Was being sent from the server to the client.,2,5795
If you can change the code it helps to use CODE_FRAGMENT ( with no host parameter or with a connected socket ).,2,5801
UPDATE: Actually it turns out that you CAN supply system properties to the Jarsigner tool it's just not in the help message.,2,5806
To allow your programs to work without re-compiling run your app as.,2,5815
When you have received the CODE_FRAGMENT warning ( fatal in Java ) retry opening a CODE_FRAGMENT but this time without a host name.,2,5827
Alarmingly my customer has discovered a setting in the Java control panel which resolves this.,2,5842
Our CODE_FRAGMENT was set to the internal host name.,2,5849
Restart your Tomcat ( important ).,2,5862
Just to add a solution here.,2,5863
My CODE_FRAGMENT's CODE_FRAGMENT was commented out by default.,2,5868
The CODE_FRAGMENT header is filled by the CODE_FRAGMENT based on the URL.,2,5877
Btw you can also try apache http components.,2,5880
You can also invoke Future #isDone ( ) prior to Future #get ( ) to know if the processing is complete.,2,5900
here is an example hot to use countdownlatch.,2,5905
If you have access to the configuration of your EJB container and you can set the executor then you could Guava's addCallback method.,2,5908
Guava provides a factory method for decorating each ExecutorService as ListeningExecutorService so you are free to use whatever ExecutorService you had beforehand.,2,5911
I also registered a new tag in CODE_FRAGMENT file as below.,2,5915
Basically the component type is mandatory for JSF in order to create the component by CODE_FRAGMENT method.,2,5933
The renderer is selected based on the component family and renderer type by CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,5936
tells JSF that the CODE_FRAGMENT should return an instance of the given FILE_NAME whenever a renderer of the given component family and renderer type is been requested.,2,5944
I have just a quick question: Are files created before they are finished or are they finished and then created?,2,5951
How do I get this string into the form of a JSONArray so that I can access it's elements.,2,5966
I'm printing a String.,2,5971
In the below code a book time is a period of time in which appointments can be made.,2,5977
So the booktime and the appointments in it are getting copied.,2,5978
The book time should be from 20:00 -6:00.,2,5983
whereas on non-daylight savings change day we see.,2,5984
The length of the appointments the span of time not yet attached to the timeline should be handled as a CODE_FRAGMENT object.,2,6001
Each date for which you want to create an appointment can be represented as a CODE_FRAGMENT FILE_NAME for a date-only value without a time-of-day and without a time zone.,2,6004
For example 8 PM in Auckland NZ is not at all the same moment as 8 PM in Kolkata IN and different again than 8 PM in Paris FR.,2,6007
You apparently intend these appointments for the time zone of central North America.,2,6008
CODE_FRAGMENT -- How long the appointment should be.,2,6018
When your are ready to determine an appointment's start and stop times as seen through the lens of some region's wall-clock time combine those parts above to generate a CODE_FRAGMENT object.,2,6024
Power tip: Stop thinking in any particular time zone.,2,6030
Think of UTC as the ``One True Time ''.,2,6031
We apply a time zone only to report a particular region's wall-clock time to the user.,2,6032
The FILE_NAME represents a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds.,2,6036
Think of an CODE_FRAGMENT as a CODE_FRAGMENT stripped of it assigned time zone.,2,6038
We can extract an CODE_FRAGMENT from each of our pair of CODE_FRAGMENT objects.,2,6040
The Joda-Time project now in maintenance mode advises migration API_NAME.,2,6048
Does anyone know the thinking behind removing this option?,2,6057
With CODE_FRAGMENT this example took NUMBER seconds with the option on and NUMBER second with it off in Java 6 update 29.,2,6059
( Should be visible in a couple of days ).,2,6064
It seems Oracle really removed the option.,2,6067
Loading and storing bytes in the byte [ ] consumes 1/2 the bandwidth versus chars in the char [ ].,2,6070
However this comes at a price.,2,6071
There is another angle to this.,2,6076
Edit 3/20/2013: An average server heap dump uses 25% of the space on Strings.,2,6082
Most Strings are compressible.,2,6083
I wrote a newsletter about this on The Java Specialists' Newsletter.,2,6095
How to send asynchronous HTTP GET/POST request FILE_NAME without waiting/reading response?,2,6099
the jsonp response looks like.,2,6109
Any Idea how to solve such problem when using CGLIB proxies?,2,6124
Example above produces output.,2,6127
If so we count the number of substrings.,2,6133
API_NAME: String index out of range: 3.,2,6137
On each iteration through the loop you're incrementing CODE_FRAGMENT as well as CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,6140
It should point to the exact line number the issue is happening on.,2,6152
list of UIDefaults by @camickr.,2,6161
Use float or double.,2,6172
read here.,2,6183
In the following 2 lines of code.,2,6186
What is context and what is CODE_FRAGMENT?,2,6188
Then what is a CODE_FRAGMENT?,2,6190
While working with netbeans I have to make a new file of category CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,6191
What is a CODE_FRAGMENT and what is a CODE_FRAGMENT?,2,6192
Jar file check following link.,2,6203
Hope it will help you.,2,6205
So what do you think?,2,6218
Its CODE_FRAGMENT method performs the CODE_FRAGMENT / CODE_FRAGMENT test described in the assignment.,2,6221
Your CODE_FRAGMENT method will pass a CODE_FRAGMENT directly to CODE_FRAGMENT.,2,6222
Call it CODE_FRAGMENT or the like.,2,6224
It accepts a regular CODE_FRAGMENT object in its constructor and simply delegates all methods other than CODE_FRAGMENT to the wrapped object.,2,6225
Since this is homework here's some hints.,2,6229
To clarify a CODE_FRAGMENT object has a method called CODE_FRAGMENT with the following signature.,2,6236
Let's look at a sample call.,2,6240
You can still compare numerically which was the goal all along!,2,6248
and finally here is the FILE_NAME.,2,6254
Assuming instance variables frst way EC CC PT are ZERO.,2,6273
CODE_FRAGMENT gets the value 1.,2,6280
No it's not the same.,2,6289
only HC will be initialized.,2,6294
all variables will be initialized ( with value 1 ).,2,6295
You can also do it as follows.,2,6298
First declare all variables.,2,6299
Then assign value.,2,6300
If you decalre CODE_FRAGMENT means all EC CC PT and HC values are one.,2,6302
Documentation: WEB_ADDRESS.,2,6304
I'm trying to post comments on an app page in Facebook.,2,6305
From what i have found the only API that is almost up to date is RestFB.,2,6310
Is this api up to date?,2,6319
Furthermore is there any other better api?,2,6321
Here is the code that i am using to post a comment.,2,6325
I know the message is posted because i can access it using WEB_ADDRESS Now my new question is.,2,6330
Is this the correct way to display posts on the app page?,2,6331
#NAME?,2,6340
I tried something like this.,2,6347
The result was byte [ ].,2,6348
You can use CODE_FRAGMENT to create a CODE_FRAGMENT from JPEG data.,2,6356
As an alternative to marking progress in the CODE_FRAGMENT itself consider decorating it with a CODE_FRAGMENT or a variation.,2,6358
Note that the GUI's CODE_FRAGMENT can update arbitrary components and the progress bar can be customized.,2,6361
Say after several text appended to a text area I want this to be appended.,2,6363
``Please wait a download is in progress ''.,2,6364
After that a download progress status with progress meter character '#' gets appended.,2,6365
Hope that helps some of you with the same problem.,1,69
I would recommend that you check the documentation for what they do.,1,137
When I print the path of the resource using API_NAME ( ''/ resource/API _ NAME'' ) it gives the path correctly as.,1,182
Which we currently are saved from using CODE_FRAGMENT.,1,269
Currently I can't see any performance degradation for 5-10k elements and 2 nodes.,1,340
It even works on Android.,1,423
CODE_FRAGMENT is designed for increased read efficiency ( since this is the primary use of the API ).,1,424
And you're able to use an external configuration file ( no extender needed ) to configure your logging.,1,469
Enabled and pointed my client to a secure port on my container and the last example ( the one that causes the exception ) works successfully.,1,519
It's a good structure for safe publishing of data among threads.,1,594
Besides increasing your heap most of the time it also helps to increase your PermGen space by using the CODE_FRAGMENT paramater.,1,654
You include your if / switch in a Factory which takes care of the ugliness and hides the abundance of ifs.,1,664
APKInspector provides both analysis functions and graphic features for the users to gain deep insight into the malicious apps.,1,724
Problem solved.,1,743
I suspect it may be more efficient to both query and write your records within each CODE_FRAGMENT but this is an assumption that would likely require testing.,1,808
It will do the correct ``legal ''stuff.,1,823
There is a slight improvement that you can do that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT's internal cache by using its CODE_FRAGMENT method.,1,910
But in the main case it works good enough.,1,1011
Stable and production ready lib.,1,1017
Not an extremely expensive operation I think.,1,1036
because it provides the lot of flexibility and improvements over using normal arrays.,1,1100
This provides the method CODE_FRAGMENT for inserting the element at specific location and it is very efficient.,1,1102
Whatever you are talking about is best done by the CODE_FRAGMENT WEB_ADDRESS.,1,1103
This will preserve the insertion order and insure no duplicates.,1,1167
They both seem to print out the list fine.,1,1171
Well a solution that works for me.,1,1320
Finally an IDE would be helpful for you.,1,1397
John Spurlock the create of OData4j personally responds to almost all of the posts there.,1,1402
As for iOS development with OData the best out there is OData4ObjC.,1,1406
CODE_FRAGMENT overrides these methods so there is no fear that such an Exception will be thrown.,1,1517
It's ok.,1,1529
Here's a set of solutions to this challenge for both JDK types and Eclipse Collections types using CODE_FRAGMENT.,1,1590
Any of the 5 options listed there should work just fine though.,1,1610
I can assure you it works from within a web app and also within an application using the Spring framework.,1,1637
take a look FILE_NAME executors as these will help with your scheduling and remove the need for the sleep.,1,1648
Useful links.,1,1683
Worked!,1,1712
Javolution Structs supports mapping of off heap memory as a data structure.,1,1726
or more concisely.,1,1774
I suggest you to use.,1,1879
Follow the steps otherwise your code is fine.,1,1930
This works for me.,1,2137
For me this worked.,1,2202
Specifically for bower there looks to be a good maven plugin here.,1,2225
It does its job but was built for our use case.,1,2231
That way you don't need to worry about API_NAME.,1,2271
I wouldn't worry too much about memory consumption unless you either have an insane number of tracks or several different maps floating around.,1,2364
I'm not too certain that the CODE_FRAGMENT solution is the best solution but I think far from the worst and should be pretty good on its own.,1,2367
So this works.,1,2396
In lieu of that however in my experience ASM offers probably the best combination of maturity flexibility and ease-of-use.,1,2545
As others have already said JFormattedTextField is the best way to do this.,1,2649
There is CODE_FRAGMENT to convert XML to JSON and mongo can deal with this on it's own.,1,2669
Curiously you are doing it right for the CODE_FRAGMENT property.,1,2761
Solved in case anyone stumbles upon similar problem.,1,2805
Of course it will works fine if only you know how many tasks you have.,1,2904
This solution is more flexible.,1,2907
but if you want you can do this.,1,2940
I have FILE_NAME that allows to download a file from the internet.,1,2942
With use of API_NAME all does work perfect.,1,2953
There are many ways to solve it the simplest is call.,1,3173
The FILE_NAME file will compile without and trouble.,1,3185
You can use Gson library ( or any other ) to parse the json object FILE_NAME object.,1,3226
Here's the official API on Java CODE_FRAGMENT useful for quantifier syntax.,1,3337
The format CODE_FRAGMENT can be used to convert any string of digits to the base CODE_FRAGMENT.,1,3404
In any case manually adding an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT to the front of the filter chain in your test will solve the problem.,1,3427
The good news: CODE_FRAGMENT is true.,1,3480
The simplest solution would be to use Java 8's Date/Time API.,1,3547
It seems after a quick google search that a popular solution to this is using CODE_FRAGMENT.,1,3560
This might prove to be useful unbescape.,1,3562
Since all but the day of month in the line prefix is a fixed length the simplest solution is.,1,3635
There is a good example showing how to put a file onto WebDAV server.,1,3922
Note: There were no errors in the console and the CODE_FRAGMENT function was working perfectly.,1,3941
That way you often don't need to implement CODE_FRAGMENT at all manually.,1,4055
And running your CODE_FRAGMENT will succeed.,1,4126
Ok I finally figured out what I was looking for ( this link was also quite helpful ).,1,4261
Earlier I was writing the file to local machine then it was working fine.,1,4423
That's correct behavior.,1,4570
I finally managed to get it to work.,1,4651
Thank you dunni for your help you've put me on the right path.,1,4652
And it works like a charm now SMILE_FACE.,1,4654
but you can use the very util FILE_NAME like.,1,4710
Java doesn't have in built method on array to do slice but there are classes which can help you with it.,1,4711
FILE_NAME under test uses FILE_NAME that has a simple autowired configuration bean.,1,4737
This answer describes what is happening more clearly.,1,4847
For example the following works great.,1,4853
It is able to handle all polygon cases including the self-intersecting ones.,1,4897
Comparison time should be fast so total run time should be only slightly more than sum of run time for each ordered query.,1,4982
Congratulations.,1,5005
Databases are much better at handling data than Java.,1,5007
Java is a fine general programming language but databases are optimized for relational data processing: they just do it faster with less CPU less memory and less network traffic.,1,5008
Embrace the Joy of Sets!,1,5015
I understand the boolean expression here.,1,5026
If you are looking for a way to write to streams in a more intuitive way try CODE_FRAGMENT.,1,5052
This is not particularly unusual... or wrong.,1,5073
Here's a knocked up utility to prove the point.,1,5244
it's worth a shot.,1,5262
I heard like Java is the most suitable platform to develop that.,1,5324
It's really good.,1,5381
It's an excellent fast library.,1,5382
At least I can commit a project on OSX and update to Windows and it still works.,1,5408
check API_NAME it's the fastest way to copy part of an array FILE_NAME.,1,5497
This works fine.,1,5518
It'll be available in JSF by CODE_FRAGMENT.,1,5600
The following code therefore might be ( as I have not attempted using it ) a better one if you are willing to use Mojarra specific classes.,1,5626
Better to use FILE_NAME API ( there are several I am not sure which one is better ) it's more straightforward solution.,1,5658
But this gets optimized by the JIT and there is no measurable impact in production.,1,5668
I still think it's not the best design but I did quite a bit of testing and can say with a good bit of confidence that it had no real impact on performance.,1,5671
Or since in NUMBER% of cases day will be correct.,1,5680
The set can be a CODE_FRAGMENT and you can wrap in an unmodifiable for good measure.,1,5685
Even in your own parsing approach you can make it faster by returning the enum when you parse the list.,1,5694
This should almost be obvious.,1,5707
The application is complete and working fine.,1,5731
And this code worked.,1,5792
Working Configuration.,1,5867
There is a solution to your problem.,1,5903
This configuration works very well.,1,5916
( Hopefully with a good example. ),1,5924
The maintainers' rationale is covered in the JSF specification.,1,5927
Also JodaTime makes calculations with time much simpler.,1,5990
The option reduces heap usage.,1,6077
For workloads that are memory capacity constrained ( i.e. have to run with limited heap space and GC takes a lot of time ) this option can prove useful.,1,6080
CharSequences can also be a lot more efficient to manipulate - subsequences can be defined as views ( pointers ) onto the original content for example instead of copying.,1,6089
With the new design they could also support other encodings in future.,1,6094
API_NAME can be used.,1,6102
Here's a good example from Jetty's wiki page WEB_ADDRESS.,1,6106
Using consistent indentation and sensible whitespace can make your code much easier to read.,1,6144
Very good example of steady pooling readHere.,1,6184
Now we're getting to the good part.,1,6238
So far i've done this for Twitter and it works very well.,1,6308
I solved the earlier problem.,1,6328
Addendum: CODE_FRAGMENT is useful for managing lengthy background tasks while displaying interim progress.,1,6359
