16311,i think autosubmitting to cause a full page refresh would be a pretty bad  experience  so id probably prefer they had to trigger the submit manually,1
16311,i agree with brad either the  complete  experience  or an unadorned pagerefreshing experience i think a partiallyworking automatic filter would be confusing,1
16378,added test to ensure single class is passed multiple classes gave false positive ,0
15999,remove this php block not required,1
16378,fallback for wildcard since there is no support to remove all classes and another loop didnt seem to make sense there is an issue with the wildcard existing where gives invalid argument error,0
10713,dpobel i would better say no    may log   runtime   errors but is not really suitable for errors that is the direct result of bad programming and should fail hard like if a typo was made in a class or method name,0
10755,thats fine for now i may merge them if i get some time,1
16402,this is a minor bug fix  should be   ,1
16412,do not add a newline between if and the following statement check framework code about it rawtaz check yii source code about newlines there is no symfony zend other code style,1
8214,done renamed timestamp to freezedate    im actually setting builddate to the actual day that the image is built because it can differ from the freezedate,0
13740,can we use something more descriptive than  and  ,0
16412,remove space after commas,1
16422,i think you might need to prefix the string with  like above  because of some other processing we do later on the chain with error messages    also  if we dont allow the comma at all in a collection title  the reserved string    doesnt make sense  sin,1
10755,id like to keep the yourkit stuff out of the oae module  you can deliver a custom template via the param to    if you add the yk java arguments to then the oae module w,1
16427,what a load of rubbish,1
15707,yep  you are right  the problem is that we dont know if more headers have been added  another option is to create a refresh method and call it from outside every time a new header is created removed  makes sense for me,1
16414,heres that bug i was talking about pipe character is a regexp special character needs to be escaped to match,0
14904,good catch  thought i got everything  ,1
15343,good catch  ill fix the debug message in ,1
16414,this should be changed to so we can have  ,1
15316,will fix  i didnt read the contributing file before contributing ,0
15932,i think id like to either do this  or remove the comment if theres a need for the method to change  well feel it anyway,1
14904,can you make this protected   also s they the in the comment,0
15932,we could probably make this change in   unless it was accidental ,1
16455,the type of is  this is not fixed  let me know if its ok ,0
15932,raising within a template is  i think  unprecedented in this codebase  so itd be good to understand a bit more about whats going on is this to defend against  calls which forget to set it in their    options ,1
16466,because the for loop starts at   it will loop once for instance  if someone picks the dates    and    and chooses to recur on monday  no loans would be added  because the time span is   for one day  which is a thursday similarly  if the user cho,1
15932,i think we could probably use a stronger selector here this will match any other link that happens to use the organisation name,1
16455,nah  object should be fine all objects are of anyway if phpdocumentor complains  well change it,1
16123,why did these need to change  the fact that it didnt break any tests means we have some untested and unverified cases here as well,1
16123,why is this changing ,0
16123,why is this needed ,0
13740,jeffheifetz i vote we dont use a status flag at all see my comment about editing the existing keepsource flag,1
16123,if it really does need an order accessor then  should be subclassed i dont really feel like this is needed though,1
16123,what does setting this to  mean  this is untested,0
16123,country code instead of currency codes ,1
16123,i feel like an option passed in with the request would make more sense if you want to enable it globally it could be an option to initialize as well this should not be the default as it breaks backwards   compatibility,1
16210,i believe this expression would be easier to understand it reduces to one level of parens and drops the confusing and      ,1
16495,this could be dryed up in a similar manner to the in the controller  since the always has the same value  and only the value of the changes    so  something like,1
16499,should these functions be exported ,0
16499,does this documentation explain anything   switch  to   ,0
16455,pmjones yes phpdocumentor was complaining  i discusses with mvreil and he mentioned to add  as param,1
14624,change to instead of clearing out button bar,1
14550,check if is true on the source,0
16499,doesnt x is dependent mean that x depends on something else  as in john is dependent on nicotine    x is a dependency of y means that y depends on x its slightly awkward  but you could say  nicotine is a dependency of johns  ,1
16537,it looks like youll only send trackadded for adding a new plugin track  and not a cue is this intended  ,1
15334,can you refactor this to use a service instead  suggesting people to use  in controllers is not really the coolest thing ,0
15334,i dont think we need a repository in the example ,1
16537,this means that track will only get trackremoved if it has a teardown defined i dont think that is right  and this should be moved outside this if block maybe right below the  statement ,1
16537,same as above  this will only work for plugins and not cues if this is intended  ignore this comment,1
14864,this is  a  every time because  is not defined maybe it belongs further down  and should be checking  instead ,1
16537,can you define a plugin that has no function definitions and still have it work  just to make the test smaller,0
15334,lets put this in a view instead ,1
15334,id remove a lot of stuff here since it is an example ,1
15441,there is a merge conflict in with a bug fix on master branch also  the tests have been enhanced on master so ensure your new code works with those specs,1
16537,should be for any type of track being added  regardless of origin cue  plugin  etc,1
15334,ha  lets remove credits ,1
13912,this is fantastic news ,0
15334,lets skip this and move to cli directly ,1
15995,it has now been moved to,1
15995,it has been placed on its own line,1
15334,can you add the driver config here ,0
14624,maybe inline error into the table  like unauth,1
15334,lets also add  to check that all entities are there,1
11557,since we know that this will happen if the original post is not there can we either   a log out a more helpful exception  b handle it without the try catch using and then just discard the reply if we dont have the original,1
16565,is this import needed  thats the default i thought,0
11557,if were doing this now using a timestamp do we need the property at all ,0
15334,then in the action something like ,1
11557,was this change also applied to replies  only ask for replies after the timestamp from the last received,0
16575,all taken care of,0
16499,ive found it useful it lets you type this  instead of this  but maybe im using them in a different way than originally intended  i often use them ,1
16594,unless is correctly published in all cases  this is not threadsafe,1
14550,is set to true  if we use the turns to false  however if we read the stream piece by piece with read it retains the value,1
14864,ah yeah i missed that one  typo fixed ,0
16456,seems to me that we have at least in  places    can we refactor to a method     thanks,1
15489,this title should have the same grade of importance as,1
15489,livedox must have his own subtitle,1
15489,probably should have his own index or something,1
16562,minor thing  but since you added the new attribute to the end of both the  definition and this methods   id propose to sort the parameters like this  ,1
16565,yeah  there is a local set class for the redis set command  so if i want it  to have the right return type  i need immutable,1
16649,this is to expose which is protected in actor,0
16594,given that the sets this unconditionally  shouldnt this be an error state here  not silently return a bogus value ,0
14510,is this valuable output  i can see how it would be useful if there are problems  but its noisy for normal usage,1
16577,this link doesnt actually work  did you load it up and test it   the link has to be  make the page name lowercase to fit in with everything else  and name it to make sure it goes through spring,1
14510,i was just following the riak way  but yeah im not the biggest fan of it either   i can remove it,1
13703,bah  yes  you are right this is why one shouldnt write code in githubs editor    in fact  the patch isnt even consistent in that it documents three values for the log kwarg  yet only implements only one i was originally thinking of allowing the user t,0
16649,the curly brace in our scala code is usually at the end of the previous line maybe the code could be formatted better    i had to read the documentation of to be sure,1
13098,instead of a try catch here  why not disable the editing functions when the view model states that the selected document is not editing      ie bind the property of the controls to ,1
14751,it needs to be one zindex higher than dont know how to give a relative zindex,1
16715,i couldnt find a pattern  but it wasnt a matter of unloading apps with sticky dirs like kernel  it can happen for any of the riak dependency apps,1
16729,thanks for describing the usecase kennethkoontz    the current way the meteor auth system is set up is that once you auth against an oauth provider your token is stored on the user document  as   for example    my underst,0
16565,just return a here ,1
16711,you copied this pattern around  times any chance you could extract it into a method ,0
13774,why dont you send msg as an argument to the hook esp should be interresting to the hook  also  why isnt there an else right before the  ,0
16736,this method should be rename to  ,1
16758,we should cap it with,1
15394,ok i thought include was a control its always called as a function  so where do we draw that line,1
16711,i started not being a very big fan of and be different classes from matrix,1
16776,needs platforms and since tags,1
15394,its not i just thought that adding the strictness would be a nice thing to do,1
16743,this should probably be   then you can use to get the key name and the string value to against,1
15394, is considered a language construct not a control structure so i think were ok there to treat it as a function  as that is how it is being used in this form,1
15394,in places where there is no clear standard that weve adopted  we should leave the code alone  when it comes down to it  someone else is maintaining that piece of code the component lead  and its   better to let them dictate the smaller aspects of ,1
16597,switching to  is good thing in this case but this    and this  ,1
16715,either way  i removed the unloading bit not having it doesnt seem to affect any of our existing tests,1
16499,oh ok  that makes sense,1
16729,ah  now i understand yes  your point makes sense lets keep it in for now    thanks for taking the time to help me understand the concern,0
16638,should there be a break  ,0
16806,makes only sense if the list is sorted at some time  i dont think thats needed for coordinate descent,1
16638,if you do not have vmware installed  install vmware player free,1
16813,can you add a bit about why someone would use this rather than the one that actually takes class ,0
16743, means the timestamp field in of the event  i think this may be better written as though perhaps as long as this special case is documented as such its fine ,1
16592,probably should be a global constant of a classlevel method on ,1
16592,hmmm  also  itd really be   ,1
16824,not sure why it has to be class loader aware,1
16824,make message consistent with what we typically do  ,1
11557,no  replies work fine with concept,1
11557,is used in ordering the feed ,0
16824,this should be enclosed in if since you are allowing null and it will override the default name,1
11557,i understand that they work fine  was suggesting that both be the same for consistency guess we cant take out of api call anyways since web uses that now,1
11557,gotcha  just checking,0
16592,wait  the person now is an instance of   ,0
15489,could i kindly ask you to edit the document as you see fit unfortunately   i do not understand your suggestions for improvement i think you only have  to edit a couple lines thank you very for much for your assistance   ,1
16592,ah  is this the place where the question about one from once class overwriting an from another class came from     thats right youll get kitchen goes into the kitchen here  this way     instead maybe you want something m,1
13774,i didnt really have any use for adding the payload to the hooks arguments  but thats a good idea    i dont want to handle only nonmatched message types in this  thoughi want to allow custom handling of  any  message type,1
11557,i think that feeds and replies update should be single api call and return them both based on timestamp,1
11557,the thinking here was that there could be tons of replies for a post that the user doesnt necessarily care about  bogging down the original response of posts  its also more complicated on the backend side as there could be a recent reply to a post that ,1
16123,this was the only instance that is not preformatting and validating the orderid i added a test case,1
16123,ouch  my bad on this one i reverted this back to the original implementation,0
16597,you dont have to change it  but in is good practice to use this   it will prevent this kind of bugs  it will save you a lot of time debugging ,1
16856,only thing thats needed here is on the child process object returned from   if you do not do this then the user sees no output during the long pause,1
16123,agreed  i moved it to be part of the options hash tests are added accordingly,1
16123,i think its opinionated to embed the in the authorization  especially when the is already part of the request do you know why it was embedded here in the first place ,1
16123,i added a documentation snippet from the official xml spec,0
16123,this is not needed it was part of the other forks implementation i got rid of it,1
16806,sorry   just figured out that for some reason pip got turned off in my ide now i can see what you mean  ill fix it right away   ,0
16597,much prefer  for the style  to me it looks wrong to put  with the value youre comparing to on the left side ,1
15394,ive removed it however notice how its under control structures ,1
15394,also removed all of them,1
16842,formatting and indentation doesnt seem right please use style              ,1
13774,well  skip the else thing then but please send in the whole msg structure  not just the payload that way you allow for the most flexibility in plugins  and it doesnt cost much,1
16889,this assumes  will always be successful if a user closes the popup without completing the login  for example   is null,1
16894,yes  use single backticks  like   note that you need to use latex notation here ,1
16889,nit should use  instead of  like you do in ,1
16889,this line doesnt do anything  ,1
16597,problem is that this is programmers error  and compiler wont catch it you are not comparing  you are assigning so this    is equivalent to,1
16889,supernit space after   i generally do a space after  as well for anonymous functions  but i also try not to use anonymous functions id actually probably rewrite this as,1
16597,i understand the bug youre referring to and what creates the difference between the comparison and the assignment     id prefer to have the variable on the left side of the comparaison and the value being compared to on the right side as i think this mak,1
16565,theres a namespace conflict on set,1
16831,dont catch  just throw through,1
16889,not sure this should throw that means nothing would get returned to the callback  right  i feel like with callbackstyle functions  theres an implied contract with the consumer that the callback   should always be called  and that errors will be sent to t,1
16831,restore newline at end of file many times   many files,1
16887,does call its own constructor or is this a typo   ,0
16887,according to the style guidelines for gecko gaia  this should be  ,1
16831,needs a better name than  like  to match ,1
16889,you dont actually use   or  here  i dont think you should bother declaring them,1
16831,dont ignore inline nodes  iterate over them  just like in dont forget to remove the comment,1
16938,im not sure because they are very specific on what we are going to test ive added more tests to test warnings and errors,1
16887,hmm does this add extra args you dont want or something to     seems like you could pass it directly and avoid the extra anon functions for each ,1
16831,it doesnt make sense to test for null here but not test for it in the other methods that load members  they would crash if they really got a null  instead ,1
16945,good catch i think i rather dumb it down a bit to only accept str and let the py version be a  to much magic will only hurt,1
16831,update the comment  are handled,1
8268,well yes  and so was  before that  but in fact in some cases it seemed direct declaration of dependency was required in the past   some cases a compile scope dependency was depending on junit   version x and that was overriding ,1
8415,shouldnt this be called    ,0
16831,classes that dont have a method dont need a method   back out this change,1
16953,it is  at the moment  because i was restricting everything to r to get  something working  im going back over the and to extend  them for rm  which is what we have already done with the gomatrix library    you are correct about the,1
8268,i think if we are going to spend the effort to update the deps  we should spend the effort to minimize there declarations as well,1
9698,this probably should be unneeded however  i would suggest unnecessary  as i think its used more,1
16565,return types should be generic and not tied to the implementation is the generic set trait alternatively you can rename the redis set or scala set via imports,1
8415,again  i dont think we want to confuse new users with this if you want a literal  use key instead  seasoned spel users will know they can use a spel literal here,1
8415,i like adapter and we already have with quick search,1
16482,arent you missing an  somewhere   even better would be  if thats the only function well need,1
16968,the padding should be set to to ensure that it causes no regressions,1
16973,it looks to me like this call to has the desired effect of removing the service from the dispatch state however i dont think its  are being treated as cleanly im not sure if that matters  but i think it,1
14575,do you want to try moving the unicode character to the end so its the last thing before the newline ,1
16945,i agree about magic ,1
14637,youll get used to it ,1
8415,well  that is not wrapped in an spca    a quick check of sublasses of point to classes ending with  the method is called after all   ,1
16968,we may want to call when setting the shadow layer as well,1
16968,call here too,0
14575,wow   that seemed to trigger it,0
8415,this is a  so yes is the right name the spca is the adapter  delegating to a source    the is different its an active component not polled that extends so it has the,1
16482,humstrange about the import   ,1
13137,a little more nitpickery but fixing this isnt mandatory  its just for future use  on its own line,1
13137,braces arent necessary for single line conditionals if i havent mentioned in the past  i tend to follow quite closely to qts code styling guidelines  but again  more nitpickery that isnt necessary to fix,1
16968,what happens when the user sets only one of shadow color or shadow offset   should we have some default values for these  if both are needed  we should only call when both are present,0
16968,similar to the comment above  what happens when you call when  for some of these fields ,0
16726,this is the only thing i dont like in the whole script  do we need that   if you take it out and outdent the stuff below it  then the cr is okay afaic,1
17022,please also pull to remove the now redundant check,1
16761,i think this method should be in the test class  not in the provider class,1
10934,are we still using  somewhere ,0
16806,the is also needed in the basic use case simple  one alpha fit with elasticnet  it cant be stored in then,1
16973,if youre deregistering a range of codes  it calls once per code  unlike during registration  where it updates the dict once per code  but calls just once for the range,1
16973,good catch this is probably spammy and raceprone,1
16973,yes  maybe it should be changed to have a  function,1
17064,kill this log line and typo,1
16806,i commit already not working code so we can agree on where to implement things    i cannot read nonworking code i would need source access to the brain  of the guy who wrote itcan i get commit rights too     to figure out  how he wants to make it wor,1
10934,were not using  or  anywhere,1
17003,mdineen was this still failing  not sure if the  was missed,0
16806,    because the prototype told me so the prototype is gold standard      also for the other tests    what do you mean by the prototype ,0
15995,i think it makes more sense to access the controller from the dialog code  context menus do it that way,1
17003,empty lines could be removed nitpick  lol p,1
16806, theis also needed in the basic use case simple  one alpha fit with elasticnet    why  i dont understand all we need is to learn the coefficients,0
17003,usually  var statements with multiple lines are indented once more to the right imo better readability  but your call  that is an opinion  and a nitpick ,1
16839,this channel should be buffered  so the instance monitor doesnt have to wait for the listener to read from the channel before continuing    actually  this opens up a vulnerability not a security vulnerability  but a deadlock vulnerability if the person,1
15774,no need to extend the other class,1
16983,maybe you could copy over the docstring examples from numpy here  so they get tested,1
17084,achtung  the default encoding is localedependent  not always utf this wont do what you expect on windows  in cron jobs  and so on    this is one thing where i think they really screwed up with python   but its been discussed before and apparently i,1
15995,remove baton from,1
15995,do not continue from this point if there is no baton,1
13489,what about making this a  or  event so that we know the video is playing ,1
17084,but   as a global variable set as     so do we want to force everything as utf   and use  everywhere  ,1
16781,i dont know  but wouldnt it be better to let the thread sleep for a short period if the service isnt available  or will this block something  dont know how long it normally takes until the service is   available normally maybe it could also be interest,1
16781,i think this line is too long,1
17084,we could use  i dont think theres any reason to save html in anything other than utf  though,1
16806, makes only sense if the list is sorted at some time  i dont think thats needed for coordinate descent    yes but thats a reasonable choice to keep the set ordered so when you  loop over features on only just positively in memory in other words  it avoi,1
16806, the is also needed in the basic use case simple  one alpha fit with elasticnet   why  i dont understand all we need is to learn the coefficients    same feeling here    if you do,0
17123,hate to monkeypatch  and would have called the original highlight function  but the original throws errors if you call it,1
17165,do you mind adding this to the header instead ,0
16304,hi matt  were going to deprecate files soon which is why it was removed from the master code  do you have custom code that uses relies on this ,0
16304,tabs look a little weird here ,1
14243,okay  this scares me is very expensive and worse yet  has in the past stomped on interface state machines and caused tables to become unresponsive are you sure reloaddata is needed ,1
16726,oops heh leftover fragment from debugging ill fix that right up,0
13489,i already test for autoplay and loop working  so this just tests that they are set when they would be read  this is fine,1
17212,do you need to specify  here or is that the default ,0
17212,that is the default not necessary,1
17212,what about  instead  kate  is there any functional difference ,0
11821,ill fix it when merging,0
17021,this should be for in result,1
16511,defining arrays like this does not allow fast indexing this was true in cython  im not sure if its been fixed that since then ,1
16511,i should specify i believe defining numpy arrays as a  function argument  leads to fast indexing  but defining arrays as variables does not,1
16511,is not in the shipped     well need fabianp one more time for windows ,0
17021, should read,1
17228,i am really not a fan of adding a click handler to the whole page  i will likely replace this with a animation handler hack so this behaviour  will only be added to specific elements as they hit the dom as seen in xtags and other libs,1
17231,what about commenting on another comment ,0
17232,i dont see where we use this method in the tests we should remove it if we dont use it,1
17231,we dont need to set the user  it should automatically be assigned from the,1
17233,qwcode id rather not require and assert a specific version that feels like it wouldnt demonstrate the typical scenario where this set of features will be useful  it also wouldnt help me clean up the   assertions in,1
17233,is there a verdict on this  keep it or not ,0
6682,i would rather see us come up with a welldefined way of injecting heira data so that its safe for us to always clobber the with our stadard version,1
6728,ok  maybe just a comment to the effect that the arbitrary selection of transitions is intended to be representative but not exhaustive  might help a maintainer if a refactoring later breaks something   either covered or not covered by the test,1
6682,i agree with this concept  but i think we need a more descriptive fact name here,1
17234,instead of using h  perhaps we should use constants  imho that would make the code more legible,1
17234,afaik the goal is to keep vars out of quotes,0
16575,i should probably add measures to if we want them to be useful right now its very difficult to index into the measures array to find the values for a specific part,1
17229,i think  is better indeed   is good too,1
17236,this line does nothing  i used it to have a breakpoint for debugging you can delete it,1
6821,can we do this   ,0
17234,cant this just be ,0
17237,is this an error in     should it not use instead  i see the implementation only needs  a spec,0
17238,still not sure about contents validation  since as a single function it turns out to be quite ugly ,1
17234, already had a value assigned on line  not sure if overwriting that is the way to go    if correct i would suggest  ,1
16429,i think we should use of a sekizai tag here to provide the css resources so that the style is available in any cms page,1
17234,cs  spacing between arguments,0
6771,if were not using puppet  is this line necessary ,0
6711,ideally this would go in a  since its needed for every test,1
17239,yes  i forgot to remove manageorgs,0
17234,cs  spacing around comparator,0
6771,not strictly necessary  but one of the box tests in veewee checks to see if puppet is installed i had to flip a coin to decide whether to remove the puppet stuff and leave that test failing or not if you   have a strong opinion either way  it can certainl,1
6771,its too bad its still version  in the centos  base repo ,1
6779,ginko this code looks like it could be cleaned up quite a lot  just declare all these variables first as blank strings  then in your if blocks just set the variables that is are different under that   condition    you could also change the ,1
6771,also  the intent was to leave these boxes and configs publicly available  and it seems the community standard is to have both puppet and chef available,1
17234, no newline at end of file,1
17243,  just push commits to your branch  no need for new pr,1
17245,paddy  could you please leave the old tests in there as well  that way we ensure there are no bc issues or at least become aware were there any,0
17241, or  from the  module,0
17234,a little indentation wouldnt hurt cant say much about the rest of this    if it works  it works for me ,1
17245,so what do we do about that bug ,0
17245,sorry for repeating myself  could you please leave the old tests in there as well  that way we ensure there are no bc issues or at least become aware were there any,0
17234,because we have only three options here and because i used the standard values of many shell commands  i think its not a good idea generally speaking you are right but in this case i think is not so   necessary,1
17234,its only a quick way to obtain the same result here,1
17247,is this github being stupid ,0
6857,how would that work  you should also update the and to use your requirement class  which wont work as we also override them,0
17247,circles dont have vertices   but actually is this even used anywhere  it looks like  just calls ,0
17249,please remove the null check should be consistent regardless of prefix,1
16575,the property was changed so it could be updated after the polygons inner and outer rings were joined once that code is refactored and decoupled from the shapefile project  this will go back to   being immutable,0
17234,actually the indentation is not possible here because i used some white spaces to indent the xslt output  this is a general xlst file to convert a docbook structure in restructuredtext format  i used the xslt syntax   the special template u,1
17240,i remember that too i must have rebased it in when i wasnt paying attention anyway  its fixed now i deleting code ,1
17248,could you rename this variable to  ,0
17234,yes  thats true,1
17240,im always open for review i wouldnt have opened a pr if i hadnt put on my asbestos underpants    i was rewriting the summary  and now im not sure if this does the right thing currently  it updates the workdir to match whats in the index  but maybe t,0
17248,what do you mean ,0
17247,there are just  points here  so the square isnt being closed if you add  as the last element in the path  it will autoclose the shape and make the starting ending vertex look better than if you just   repeated the first coordinate,1
17241,i would rather say the optimal   subtree   ,1
17248,can you add a link to the documentation      you can write multine comments with,0
17234,the code is not so clear here  you are right i reused the output as a new variable i will change this,0
17228,im not sure you need to credit me for this  although if it were more of a hack  its not a bad way to make have to not say anything bad about it ,1
17248,this is about the last method in the doc  without using acl but i dont think its a good idea to implement it,1
17240,good catch done ,1
17248,oh  no  not a good idea ,1
17228,i think andreas is taking a hardline about uses of  even though i think this is pretty harmless  you have a getter  so its probably somewhat annoying to change  but i have discharged my duty in   warning you about it,1
6857,yeah  i also thought about that in my opinion we shouldnt override and  say somebody customized these files in  and upgrades to   all his changes are lost i think its a bad idea you said yourself  that the se works as a s,1
17228,dont people usually do it like    i dont care  just wondering if this is believed to be better for visibility  etc,0
12338,change it back  its that way for a reason,1
17247,nit by repeating  at the end to close the triangle  the beginning ending vertex corner is drawn as two lines butted together  rather than coming to a sharp point like the other corners if you instead   use  as the last element  the shape wil,1
17254,kinda hacky  i know ,1
17247,actually  you might have to just leave off the last  here and  after you recenter below,1
17247,the  is pretty dark and makes it kind of hard to read some of the measurements perhaps this would look better   is the backg,1
17255,i think prefixing the modules with and having the namespace is confusing how about this for the module names,1
17247,yeah  this is used in the dataensure on l to make sure the inner shape is totally enclosed by the outer shape there are some weird corner cases literally d,1
17255,this could become an attribute of the app thats make it more yuilike,1
17251,i dont mind  i am okay with that    while i am at it  i must warn you  though  i am currently making  huge  changes on the tree structure see  i dont know how we should resolve our future conflicts   ,1
17257,could you call this something more descriptive  perhaps  ,0
16575,im responsible for this  sorry,1
6725,i believe we can actually change the  to be  to cut down on the typing and not need to define the  its one of the things i really like about faraday,1
6725,we are using the  middleware  so well get an exception if things dont work,1
17249,the reason the null check is here is so that it will make if the doc is null not sure what the desired behavior would be in this situation if i remove the null check but  still contains the id    in a sense the ,1
17237,what do you think about collapsing these two lines in one   ,1
6725,you should just be able to pass the  hash directly in as the second argument to  without needing to convert it to a string were you having problems with that ,1
17255,might be useful to pass the  option so you get a instance back from this,1
16575,limitation   i would call that a showstopper,1
17237,i am thinking of having a single histogram function without     does input validation literally in  lines and then  it calls i think we should put the code in one function  it made sense to separate ,1
17245,both lines are the same  is the unicode escape for  json interprets them as the same thing,1
17261,dont hard code these values use,1
17245,fixed in source  sorry  the comment can be deleted,1
17260,its a convention there may be issues with very old clients where being case insensitive was not strictly observed id simply prefer that we not deviate from what esapi does since it was written by   wiser minds than mine if its explicitly upper casing ,1
16575,this might be used otherwise it will be removed  see my comment above,1
7018,in order for to find this class  it  must  be called  see the static initializer and for or,1
7018,also  will never use this instance  since it always constructs its own instance,1
17262,wrapped everything into a that seems to be the easier and more readable approach,1
7165,maybe the comment above is worded incorrectly  this method works fine  if you are using only a few segments in a  since you can calculate the number of samples by adding up all the times if there are going to be multiple  then you have to d,1
17263,fix order container  display   no need for the part,1
17263,put a comment on these saying the unit is pixels,1
17263,put a comment with the unit,1
16575,were going to have to support polygons crossing the idl sooner or later  i guess the question is if shapefiles allow it   and if so  is it important enough that we should do it now ,1

7043,wow  overlooked while copying from one file to another  fixed,1
6878,it says here  but in you have   is one of these a typo ,1
17264,appcelerator coding standard requires testing for null  eg ,0
17228,lol  that was actually more a todo item the code i have now is not your error handling code ,1
6878,indeed  i think the extra is a typo  sort of redundant  ill fix this in the docs,1
17237,sounds right i will move the text output code in the caller in     we can figure out later how exactly to output as text,1
6711,did that  thanks for the suggestion ,0
17268,whats this function doing in here   it probably shouldnt exist since its only called once,1
17237,a little thing that slipped through with over    i will prepare a separate small pull request with this fix and another one for over later,0
17268,using an early return here may make the following else block a bit clearer since the else starts on line  and ends on line ,1
17265,note pull upstream master before doing this,1
17268,the  shouldnt be hard coded in here since gutsy is open source and presumably someone one day besides may want to use it  we probably do this elsewhere  if so  we should maybe just fix all of   them in another pull request  otherwise ,1
17265,i remember trying to remove the if and it errored out somewhere,1
17268,you may want to use the parser thing in utils here,1
17265,schema is probably different since i did a lot of database stuff on other branches  and i was trying to figure out how to do everything,1
6947,how about adding something like,0
17283,yeah youre right  this shouldnt be top level  it fixes the test but the test is flawed since will never be a fact    ive reverted this commit,1
6667,dont change the version when submitting a pull request let the librarys manager choose which version goes with changes,1
17287,these lines still expose the render logic in the view it reads like theres a possibility of both partials rendering    a better pattern would be  then  conditionally render in the presenter,1
17286,could you do a quick check and see if there is actually a requirement for explicitly an   id love to move this logic to have it consume a generic  and the,1
17286,it should actually be possible with the compromise of losing access to the  stuff ,1
17285,maybe would make more sense than    add to the top of file      if becomes unless,1
17288,i dont like this loop can you change this to  and then remove the loop  might need to pull upstream master if squeel is not installed    actually  do this,1
17287,yeah  that is good feedback ,1
7164,on refresh flow  we need to send client secret also ,1
17286,are you sure that we need a wrapped hydrator  after all   should allow you to access the fields directly also for writes  also here  could you do a quick check and see if  and,0
7164,chatter can call this version to the get the url i can put this method into chatter  but i feel isnt used directly by anyone  so it should be ok ,1
17286,use statements instead of this also  we should probably rely on ,1
17285,dont need this line if you do the changed above,1
17286,also here  use methods  and  from the interface,1
17234,freeaqingme this is standard getopt usage  not just in zf  but any library or language that provides getoptstyle cli argument parsing and i mean down to the syntax used to interact with it,1
6769,i think this line should be removed  what if we want to test that katello gives a proper error message when the description is left out   we should be able to use this task for such a test,1
6878,i like this  though the way it updates  at the end seems unnecessarily hackish  could it not just return maybe a dict and let the caller decide what it wants to do with the results   this works for expat    but if there isnt already a local vari,1
17286,use the  from the target class  here,1
7164,this shouldnt affect the normal flow it is required for ip bypss flow ,1
7024,as long as youre doing this  might as well make it something like    this would make it backwards ,1
17286,use  instead this is premature optimization,1
17282,dont need if you do what i said above,1
7164,need to store this  as we require it for refresh flow ,1
6878,cooli dont think i even would have thought of this  but i like the idea,1
7164,lets the application override this method to provide its own helper ,1
7164,let the application override this to decide if it wants to load ip bypass flow  or regular flow ,1
7164,all this moves to the   application can override this method to provide their own auth finish task   ,1
7164,removing account shouldnt be done on the ui thread since we already have an  removing the accounts here ,1
17291,you reverted them the wrong way,1
7164,this got moved to the async task ,0
17287,designating the       and  methods as helpers unintentionally exposes them as helpers to woople a better place for them would be in the ,1

7064,this message is wrong i changed the plugin the npanday file is repleaced by and the message could be something like   could not be found add set the path to th csc folder  ,1
7064,same as in csc next comment,0
17290,i swear git is crazy sometimes,1
17286,i dont agree with you about this one this is not premature optimization we dont need to load it  why loading it   this is just good sense p,1
17290,well just a minor thing you might wanna rename this to and same on the method above,1
7146,have  empty lines a special meaning in the code ,1
17286,that is mainly because  is an orm specific method,1
17292,is the needed here  will it work if you always use this  also  i find it a little hard to understand whats going on  can you try defining a separate function for the   instead of usin,1
17286,since we should ideally move to  and eventually extend the features here with more specific optimized logic  thats why i suggested to use ,1
7252,this is a bit hard to read    a better pattern might be  ,1
17293,from what i can infer from the controller  the user admin is supposed to set this in a form  so should be fine for deprecated,1

7241,average is generally abbreviated avg ave is avenue,0
17296,style commas should be followed by a space,0
17295,this probably wont work did you test all those ,1
17296,can you rename  to something less verbose  i think  is fine  as it is  that is finally concerned with what to do with the contents,1
17299,youre making capybara dependent on jquery    a  huge  no to this,1
17300,it would be nice to have specs for these changes  and not just in the rspec matchers ,1
17298,replace l with,0
17300,yeah  agreed but where besides rspec matcher specs ,1
17301,ive tried my dev environment but it breaks the  template from because it uses the  so this has to be changed there too  before merging thisone ,1
17302,ah yes  totally right,1
17302,worth sending this to crew or techteam ,1
17303,dont we need to drop this ,1
17265,no idea why this file is different for you dont commit this file here,1
18785,it would help performance in the server itself,1
18785,true  and i cant see any problems as such with it  im just saying ,1
18785,returns the simple name of a spell eg confringos simple name is fireball at least i think this is what evilmidget is trying to achieve ,1
18785,no  it gets the of the class itself  which is what does,1
18785,cant this just be ,0
18785,ah right this change is not needed then,1
18785,exactly my point its much neater and does exactly the same,1
18785,should even be  to avoid confusion,0
18785,i might change what does it  and how the spell name is stored though  but yeah  it is  and tbh you should have noticed  especially given this is code that is tested to work  and something like that   would break it,1
18785,you dont want it done in the constructors  very important values are set  for javaplugins via a initialize method  if things are initialized in the constructor  were creating objects and initializing   them with essential traits being null,1
18785,or even,0
18785,i prefer the neater approach of them instead putting the spells jar file inside the folder  as theyre truly writing plugins for this plugin  it doesnt really make senseor is as efficient for them to create   a bukkit plugin thats simply adding onto ,1
18798,no reason  changed to itervalues in,1
18785,then the initialisation should really be a part of the pluginmanager just send an instance of the plugin over to an  initialize  function and set every object there,1
18785,if were going to have plugins for this plugin  they might as well be able to access everything,1
18785,i do this a lot  and am doing it  and i have had no problems so far,1
18785,without the method will be null  therefore it would throw a npe immediately upon the starting,1
18785,if a user wants to create just a spell they use this method if they want to do more then they should be able to make a plugin that accesses everything,1
18798,the behavior that i initially had in mind was that the reverse mapping would just hold the first token to generate the id but it doesnt really matter whether the reverse mapping holds the first token or   most recent token that hashes to the id  in either,1
18803,even though i think weve come a long way from c  ill move the declaration to the top   also  good call on using ,1
18785,that isnt the case for all the other classes though very few of them will be affected in this way,1
18785,true  but one problem to write a class extending spell  you need to have  and for which you need to add the bukkit api as a library,1
18785,created issue for this ,0
18785,im not sure why needing the bukkit api is an issue,1
18785,they actually can access everything  as spells are passed an instance of ,1
18785,it isnt  its just that its only a few steps further to just writing a plugin  which would have a lot more power,1
18785,they can access everything  but not in a practical way  itd have to be in the constructor,1
18785,you have to have a constructor anyway,1
18798,to more directly answer your question i had wanted  to be none when the key in the dict i should have written   but as i say above  that behavior isnt n,1
18811,can you hyperlink method names     eg instead of  do ,0
18785,okay  im going to change partly to for the sake of readability and obviousness  and im going to modify and bring into use the spell annotation for description and alternate namesalthough class   names will still be used if an alternate name is,1
18785,oops  that wasnt intended to be a tag oh well,1
18811,no problem  ill update them,0
18827,dont know how that happened,0
18827,also dont know how this happened,0
18827,warning implicit conversion changes to   ,1
18827,c   allows you to specify the underlying type so you should be able to make it unsigned that way,1
18827,it would also probably be better to use set,1
14540,completely optional  but you could reduce branching logic we need to test with this,1
14540,if you want to log anything  we should probably use a log instance,1
18838,it looks like a copy paste error here a corrected issue is one that is referenced from scm comments in a failed build  and are posted on the next successful build,1

18856,i see some inconsistency in the naming for setup and teardown  become and unbecome are calls to perform something while and are callbacks  setup and teardown should perhaps be named and to indicate that they,1
13697,is the minimal spanning tree unique ,0
18860,as mentioned  those should be private and have a getter,1
18860,there is a     no need to go over the server instance,1
18798,hmm  and what if two words in the document map to the same id ,0
18860,i actually meant a getter not a delegated method ,1
18860,yeah  but i only need to look things up that one way  so why expose the  actual hashmap     seamless improvements ,1
18868,i was wondering if i needed a  function that returned a results class instead of just having the fitted attributes as part of the model class  however  ld have a class with only a fit function and nothing   else  which didnt seem right  but  it mig,1
8112,oh man  i hate simplyianm  for that    will change it after i get a go for this,1
18873,i believe all the values are given names with the k prefix  for example ,1
18803,about the declarations at top  there are some things that make sense in order to be consistent with the project style and bitly style  even if i might not do that on a new  personal project,1
18868,yeah i would return a results class from fit the model should at least have a fit and a predict method,1
18874,if we need this  then i think its a sign that we still need to override ,1
12392,if the pull request  for  gets given the go ahead  id be happy to convert this to be a new descriptorstyle gsobject  it looks very good  and great to have the new improved factors for hlr and   fwhm,1
18878,yes  a small point    mostly concerned with having an approachable api,1
12392,as has happened before  i have to confess to not feeling very qualified to comment on this tree stuff  having not coded up anything similar in the past myself,1
18879,i think this part of fix should be merged  this is no need to reinit bundle again  we just need to use the existing one,1
12392,great that you harmonized these  params to the pythonlayer style,1
18880,i think we still need this for some use cases i know i had some  or should it be an argument to   ,1
18880,oh sorry  i see that its moved above ,1
17992,do we use the start year of the project or the file   the file was created in   not sure where the  came from,0
17992,this line should probably be moved up by the other attribute definitions for ,1
17992,add a comment above this block saying something like here we handle manually selected modes,1
17992,in this method you are inconsistent about where you are putting spaces after  and   i think we want something like    i know the code style things probaby seem nitpicky  but they make the code much easier to rea,1
17992,i see that you are using a list of regular expressions  but each list has one element  do you think we really need the list   it would simplify the code if there was just one regexp per mode,1
17992,is this block here in case the config dict has a key where the name of the mode is not  but just    if i am reading this correctly  in this case  you just switch to that mode directly  this logic happens   after the first line regexp has ,1
17992,do you think we need to have open and close strings other than the default ones ,0
12392,as the status of  is not changing  would it be faster to move this  switch outside the  ,1
18860,this was here because of our annoying plugin it blocks people otherwise,1
18883,i really like how you have refactored this method ,1
18883,i have not used js exceptions before  but it probably makes sense to start doing so  does js have a notion of exception types we should could use ,1
18860,ahh the objc naming conventions,1
18884,in my installation  i had to change this to  instead of  this was for paginating  asis it kept generating the  folder in the root directory instead of in   as  just returned  ,1

12392,does this use of  come from some argument  such as considering the taylor expansion of  for  ,0
18885,this type of if statement only needs to be on the base classes  i would just put the code in this block at the top level and get rid of the test  see  and  for an example  i know this is very weird,1
18885,i would put  before  as it is called first,1
18885,the notebook is currently broken in this branch  due to typo here should be ,1
18885,code style comments  put spaces before and after  in each of these dict elements  spacing of callback to be ,1
16953,why are you using this format for centroids  why not just have the row be the index of the centroid ,0
16953,if you had the row be the index of the centroid ie  the centroids matrix would be  then this would be a call to  instead of ,1
12392,am i being totally dense  or is this a square region   if so  i was a little confused by the mention of r at line ,0
16953,youre right  ill change it    fyi i just made an unstable  in progress commit to the bic branch  i  refactored  rewrote  and added a higher level function to  submit with an upper and lower bound of k    it is rough  but i think this,1
16953,the row of centroids is the index for the centrroid  stores this in column   check the latest commit where i put up an ascii diagram to show how the matrices relate  i probably still have some   filtcols lying around that need to be cl,1
8150,im not totally happy with the overloaded  argument i noticed this feature in expressjs  and see it being very useful  and  looks nice but this ended up being hard to document  so that signals   something isnt ideal with the api    i,1
12392,ah  i see  later you also build a lookup table for the x values  hence it becomes analytic in the sbprofile sense,1
12392,right  analytic in the sbprofile sense just means that it can directly return the value without using the full d fft  so a lookup table counts,1

18898,patch looks good curious where did this routine come from ,1
18899,it might be a good idea to also unregister the signal handler just before is called later in,1
18900,this will have a global effect on the tests and will need to be undone at the end of execution perhaps     ,1
18900,i think it would be better to rename this file to something like     additionally  it might be worth mentioning inside the file that this is only used in the  tests,1

17992,im thinking of this branch to change the highlight     for raw cell that dont need cell magics prefixes     you could match on a git diff patern  or else maybe even  that should be handeled correctly by normal modes     tex for example ,1
18904,my first idea was to define a tuple type and  instead of  this operator i would have used for both transition and merge however  i found working with tuple types less convenient than just having each   field as an individual argument of ,1
18904,while i agree in principle  one should never have using directives or declarations at file scope in header files however  using declarations in a definition of a class can only be used to import names   from a base class,1
18904,i have no definite answer yet but i want to mention that for some modules initialization at least in the first iteration will depend on the first input tuple and cannot be done before seeing this,1

18916,all of wence accessor were written that way  i assumed that it had to do with property decorator being runtime whereas cython code is compile time  ,1
18916,it is kinda ugly  but it is backend code  the fact that you have to know the side effect of the accessor does not bother me much especially considering the code of the accessor is actually just above   also  those line are required only because we have to ,1
18899,this is a good pt but wont be necessary after i make the changes above,1

18918,i tend to use  for stuff like this will take any symbol with a  at the end and call that method on it and use the symbol for pretty error messages so good things like     etc are all possible,1
12392,yes  good catch  ill add that documentation,1
12392,yes  i added it here too now,1
12392,sorry  i started this file by copying the airy version and forgot to edit this description,1
18883,yes no notreally  i found this  but you basically cant catch only some type or exception  or you need to use a switch case each time and reraise them  in the other hand  you can throw any,1
12392,yes  the python layer has these names for  but we never changed the corresponding stuff in c    and i dont see a compelling reason to,1

16806,you should use otherwise some time will be spent centering the data which is not necessary here,1
16806,besides the memory jump difference iterate on active features or reduced set should do the same amount of computation and it should at least for small data be almost equivalent right ,1
18919,lines should be wrapped to  cols please,1
18919,please do not use global variables  i dont like this solution at all,1
18919,again  no globals  dont care whatever else you do  please no globals,1
18919,this is not correct as there is no c support i guess this is a  mistake,1

18927,you shouldnt need to use  here  just use  when you want to pass the call on to the inherited version,1
18927,unfortunately the  method on a user is very expensive  so we need to be very careful where were using it  or find a way to optimise it,1
18927,this method is likely to be very expensive  at the very least it will need to get the bounds from the gc object and do an  filter using those bounds so that we can roughly cut down the matches using   a tile index filter    if this is just to ,1
18927,same again  this shouldnt need qualification,1
18927,this change should be unnecessary  rendering the  partial from a changeset view should default to the one in the same view,1

18927,please dont duplication the  calculation here  just add an extra parameter with a default value  and then make this routine call it with a different scale,1
18875,you can pass a tag name into  which then behaves essentially like   but during parsing so its affected as well,1

18895,well have to keep this in mind  we have not built a release that used a native dll up until now,1
18895,although  all the configurations are set to build x  i might be wrong,1
18930,the problem with the  attribute of the  annotation is that the test will pass if any code in the method throws the exception usually its better to use the  rule so you know which method threw the   exception    in this ca,1

18935,i think were digging ourselves our own tombs with this not sure if it should be handled in this pr  but do you agree that we should stop doing   and instead allow entire strings ,1
18935,i agree plus this is hard to understand  to my opinion i mean  the multiple drivers thing,1
18931, can trigger sideeffects ie  lazy typechecking  you should wrap this in a  ie  replace  with ,1
18935,no  for sure not to be handled in this pr  but still to be handled somewhen will open an issue,1
18914,i wouldnt store the instances in i would create new class  that would provide them or could provide them,1
18931,if it works  its better to use though  it may not compile with scala  you need to test it  if the name constant is not available in scala   keep your code  but add a note so that we remember   to get back to this,1
18895,this will work if you stick on only delivering an x version of    well  looks like kgybels is already bumping up against that limitation on his repo so i guess well be changing over to amd,1
13932,sure we can do that and woud end up with  classes subclassing from one and it would be easy to do obviously  but i wanted to keep it to gather for now until this is the only concern  everything else is addressed and pushed and rebased with master so some,1

13932,yeah im not sure thats the right solution either i may be getting old  but i find it difficult to keep track of all these conditionals in my head,1
13932,given these else conditions are identical  i think you can significantly reduce the complexity by using,1
18940,a comment here would be nice i think this is using a bisection method to find an optimum solution  but it would be nice if i had some confidence that that was the case  ,1
13932,ditto  and the next one,0
18940,there is a lot of tight coupling here with the axis knowing about the locators private  attribute can you think of a neater solution short of adding  and  ,1
18914,i agree with you guys    for sure this is not the best approach  but the current events system cant handle this without create a event manager per entity class  and we dont have a di to store shared instances    if you have a better solution are welcome ,1

18931, needs  have you overseen it or do you mean that it is unnecessary  to check the tuple class ,0
18931,ooops sorry  my mistake,1

32108,the associated model should be removed if all references to that model are being removed,1
32108, and so on,0
32108,did you mean to leave this in  also   is useful here,1
32108,odd place for this,1
32117,i think this should be formatted a little better,1
32117,this should have a docstring or since it seems internal a prepended underscore    actually  i think both would be good no need for a doctest  just explain what the function does and that it is internal,1
32117,i think group generated is instead of generators are,1
32117,it says return the coset representation of an element  but there is no argument to specify the element ,1

32135,ive been reluctant to add apispecific tokens to scribe  this is falls out of the scope of the library,1
32136,looks like my less compiler does things a little bit different p,1
32138,cant we use the  protocol here to get these values  or maybe something in the  module,1
32137,sure  ill fix it and send another pull request im not up to snuff on older versions of python i didnt know  lacked support for named exceptions ,1
32139,please adjust coding style so it fits see the if just below  also i think using might make more sense,1
32138,i tried both  and  but they dont work in this case  ,1
32139,what about just doing a  and if that fails then complain to the user ,1
32142,right now  the only difference between mac and windows is which configure script to run  maybe its best to just have one set of instructions instead of two  what do you think ,1
32141,i think you need to check for null and return an error here,1
32142,we can avoid if we update the configure script to only sudo the command that installs global npm modules,1
32142,lets add a link to ,1
32142,true but we havent yet ,1
32141,the  state is interesting when i was originally thinking about this problem  i was imagining more states  for example a  could put you in a  state  but then on the next character you would exit that   into one of three states ,1
32141,instead of exiting with a goto  i would be tempted to add a  state and have terminal cases such as this just go into that state and then let the loop exit naturally,1
32141,i was thinking of this too  but theres also the issue of operator chaining  im using the state machine to detect operators and dispatch the parsing operations  and  to parse the argument to the caret   it seems l,1
32141,yeah  that seems cleaner  made me feel a little dirty,1
32149,guys  but i really dont like this name  we write code  which is reading by manymany people  for me spring always is archetype and i can say the same about others  ,1
32150,but here it would probably be easiest to do this  ,1
32149,no  if you dont add  you should return just   also keep in mind may return   null    so  it should be something like this  ,1
32149,thanks  ill add the check,1
32149,you use here  however  if youll make changes inside as ive shown above this test will be redundant  ,1
32149,i agree i basically went off the original jira but i am more than happy to change this to something less obtrusive,1
32149,is redundant just declare in the config  add to the transformer element and autowire it  imho,1
32148,i think this is a mistake  both need to be there  i think  the second maybe in a pack,1

32148,dont we want to use info on most rescued stuff  indicates an actual problem,0
32169,did you mean should be none  if so  how would be treated in the code  poisson noise from the object flux would be ignored ,0
32169,i guess we have to do some work to understand how our subfields overlap when it comes to photometry   when youre doing photometry  where does the error on the fluxes of each pixel come from     as i wrote it  this is meant to mirror how source extractor ,1
32148,i guess option  makes the most sense,1

32148,so nice to be getting rid of this hardcoded stuff,1

32169,thanks  will fix,1
32148,  yeah  weve definitely got to use the existing fetch mechanism as the codename api,1
32182,i think this is a typo  it should be ,1
32169,not a  great  reason to keep this more modular only depending on numpy  and to make it slightly clearer what is being returned im imagining that most of the time these functions will be not be   used directly  but will instead be called from the imag,1
32169,i know this is a bit annoying although hopefully not  too  much more than copyandpaste from   but i think you should have parameters and returns sections here and the other functions below    people will certainly be doing ,1
32148,userstamp doesnt handle that ,0
32169,definitely agree that each function should have a full docstring im waiting to do it until were sure we dont want to edit the docstring for  too much more because it is mostly a copypaste  as you   said,1
32195,why   this seems like an arbitrary limit  you can push as much data as you want  youll simply tradeoff against collisions,0

32206,im confused what is this code doing   does the  object do something special after  is used   doesnt look like this code is using  at all after joining,1
32206,im not  sure  but from what i was able to gather  this just joins the room so that works the type is   and the conference actually a jid it seems that you have to be joined to the room before   the delive,1
32206,also  is not the most idiomatic piece of ruby out there ,1
32148,i think most of them are references  i was working on a way to just have to supply the ones that are not in the pattern as a codename  in a lot of places  the is more convenient to use than the name   anyway  and this is a ver,1
32148,with something like this  we would not have to list out any  only the exceptions to the pattern,1
32148,please be more specific  you want to put them on a different class  thats just moving them  you dont like the method names  or the way it uses the class attributes     ,1
32148,that seems like an api win since that is the most common case  would make it simpler and faster maybe too,1
32148,this is used by the tasks thing  so i think it will be a leftover and get deleted  took this out too  it is referenced in a tasks method  obviously we dont have any tests related to this nothing new   failed with it gone  and we want to remove that ,1
32195,theoretically  you should have  collisions at this point,1
32148,this seems like something leftover from a bad idea  ill see if it is referenced anymore  not used  i took it out,1
32195,and really  if this isnt a good test  thats fine i was also trying to test the clearing of redis did something if you ramp this up from   then more than this test would fail if you didnt clear redis so   whatever you think is best,1
32148,they are a bit of a pain  but dont we need something like this for a couple of things     wait  i cant tell whether you are pointing above or below,1
32148,youre asking me   oh  you mean just the  not sure about that,1
32148,we would have to test  but you may be right  i may have added it when something else was broken  or it may actually be necessary,0
32148,but it needs a test if we want to keep it and use it,1
32148,that was used for the which is now history  i think  this routing would be handled in the new rack based stuff when it arrives  i will delete it,1
32148,you mean i did this   sorry  im sure i never meant this as a final solution,1
32148,was only referenced in a couple of specs  got rid of that and i think this is good now  ,1
32195,there is no guarantee that there will be  collisions bloomfilters are probabilistic data structures it is  highly unlikely  that you will get a collision with your configuration  but  it is  possible    which makes for some great heisen failures in yo,1

32148,i agree  and i keep getting myself confused about the final api on this stuff    yes  lets address this by getting rid of the old stuff at the right point in the process,1
32224,use a fat arrow here also,1
32224,so  lets just get rid of these aliases as per our discussion on irc,1
32224,i was obviously half asleep when i wrote that,1
32222,thanks artem  we can actually remove this element as the transactions will be handled by the poller in case of an inbound adapter,1
32233,npc casting it seems dumb  but people do dumb stuff  bang crash    add this to    ,1
32131,agreed  although the user doesnt have to use for sure we should check to see if is defined  otherwise this will blowup apart from that  what if we offer a localization feature  where home    and action,1

32222,yes  amol  i understand  im about this javadoc its not reflect the reality of resulted  however  i think this code will be moved somewhere up  when mark will give agree to implement ,1
32148,this was  i think  we may want to move parts of this to session or whatever that becomes,1
32236,sorry  i overlooked this could you move this type to the main  namespace ,1
32148,session will be problematic unless it will play well with the existing session model class that is more or less implicit  and i agree with   and that it needs a better home,1
32222,markfisher what should be the best way to refactor this  should we create a common util class under where we store common xml config parsing utility methods  ,0
32222,yes  i am not too happy about having this duplicated code here basically the whole block is copied and needs to be moved asap let me nag mark again ,1
32148,all the changes in lib util have been reverted    delete,0
32169,yes  i was suggesting by default  which would mean that poisson noise could be ignored which it can at long wavelengths,1
32248,the function is not synchronous so error would be assigned after compilation and lost and its not  because you throw away result of execution you should probably use ,1
32148,these are related to the replacements for and that may have been on the user class   not sure what it was exactly before  but these are the class vars for the replacements,0
32148,this one will not new the card if it isnt there  it returns nil in that case  i think the use case depends on it returning the card when it finds it,1
32226,while this will probably always work  it should really either be  or  or ,1
32148,i dont think this has to be hardcoded  but it was convenient a few times in debugging  in any case  it shouldnt need to be hardcoded,1
32148,re the stamper attribute explicit in the version create  i think i may have had trouble getting the equivalent of this to work right for revisions  or maybe i hadnt done it right yet,1
28029,i dont see how this will harm anything,1
32148,for debugging  should remove when finalizing the branch,1
32267,bug  as its again instead of   fixing this with my refactor and adding a unit test because i am getting afraid ,0
32148,that may be debatable  but i changed this case back  i did notice the same pattern two other places  and i wonder if you find it the same there,1
32268,out of curiosity  why these  lines are enclosed with     is there something special about this syntax im not aware of ,0
32268,nothing special  i think there may have been an else on line ,1
32148,i think maybe the whole file can be removed  or at least thats the goal,1
32281,that line is unnecessary  the assignment is unused except as a return value,1

32148,i added a new codname method that looks it up in codenames,0
32297,one more second here leaves time for  ticks on the kinetic scroller timer  so a displacement of      pixels    that increase could be made dependant on whether kinetic scrolling is enabled or not  and adjusted on the current displacement s,0

32305,this shouldnt be here,1
32305,a bit of an explanation as to what this does would be helpful,1
32305,when the server has a lot of ip addresses and i want to do proxy throught special ip  listen on that ip didnt help  server will connect throught default ip  this patch fix it  ,1
32148,i think this test can be if codename  but we need tests for it  then,1
32305,right  i get that i mean in the file itself  such that others viewing the example later can make sense of it that  and id collapse the proxy examples  no need for two  just document this option,1
32308,the problem with this is that i depend on a specific function being defined in this  if it were possible to override it  it would break a lot of things of course  this kind of override is not exactly a part   of any public api anyway  but at thi,1

32313,extracting the ray code out into its own class was necessary for making it easier to do ui testing,1
32313,this factory object is what im currently using to put together a sequence of worlds to be played in order  along with their descriptions it would probably be much better as some sort of dsl  or even a   json file  ,1
32148,i attempted to get rid of this  but there are clearly dependencies  what i intended for this is that it would be automatic  generated if necessary when you assemble all your packs with the core and   deploy,0
32313,similar to   this code could probably benefit from a nice dsl but in the code below you will be able to see how my generalized world objects are meant to be used the  reflects the layout of the world   used in practic,1
32313,notice how the  object is now fairly ignorant of gamespecific terms it is up to the  object and the file to introduce those this is a win  but does make the  object a bit more cumbersome to use,1
32313,this is about as simple of an object as you can imagine  but its mostly because i didnt really add any abstraction at all it probably can be the home of more interesting level specific logic later,1
32313,if it werent for floating point rounding errors  this point would be guaranteed to be within the  from  ,1
32313,because there  is  a possibility for floating point precision errors  i do rejection sampling and generate a new point if it is not in the distance range this is messy business  and is possibly a sign of a   bad model the problem is that the borders betwe,1
32315, below should also set this and become lazy,1
32148,this method needs to be used in a few more places  or the underlying  which iterates through the set members resetting the patterns on each one,1
32313,before the points we chose were truncated to integers  now that they arent we need to prevent displaying giant unformatted floats but i sort of hate doing formatting code in data structures  perhaps   this belongs elsewhere ,1
32313,this is a clever tagging trick which facilitates easy lookup of points via the  object that  wraps its points in its a bit of a kludge but works surprisingly well,1
32313,total hack this is a sign i am trying too hard  i should instead be creating an enumerator here  or storing and incrementing an index,1
32313,this is definitely a sign of an object that needs to be extracted whenever you have a method that says lets delete all the variables and reinitialize them  you are essentially recreating object   creation destruction mechanisms still  i struggled to f,1

32318,what about something like  i feels cleaner  wdyt      ,0
32313,needed to remove this because the presenter needs to present messages throughout the game  not just at the end,1
32148,surprisingly  this badness is not introduced on this branch  though the comment is here  me thinks we should look at what this should be on develop,1
32313,determining whether the game is finished now relies on a boolean field  which is actually a bit cleaner than checking for the presence of a display message,1
32313,while it was a bit tedious to set this up  it makes it possible for us to both run the game as an executable script  and also control it grammatically from  testing tool,1
32313,this whole tool is a huge hack  and required tons of trial and error with mostly undocumented ray functionality however  it does seem to allow us to simulate a player pressing the wasd keys in an   attempt to reach a certain position in the world  which al,1

32313,this makes searching through the  objects that  aggregates easier in retrospect  it would have been better to store these objects in a hash keyed by point label with a catchall for unlabeled points    possibly that would have been much mor,1

32342,yeah im not going to fix the whitespace for now,0
32342,data is already being split into packets by tcp  im not sure what your option would do better this test just specifically forces it because thats what we test here,0
32342,the data is transparently sent as multiple packets by tcp  but theyre reassembled into a stream when theyre received so this interaction between the two layers isnt usually seen by the receiver unless   its on a slow link with high packet loss and or hi,1
32342,i agree we need specific tests for this  i dont agree that this has to be in the client for unusual behaviors  raw is what should be used  you already know im not a fan of adding dozens of nonsensical   options to my code  ,1

32403,changed to no since it should only be testing stylistic i guess  feel free to change it back,1
32398,oh  i didnt know,1
32406,this function doesnt appear to be used anymore  i take it thats because the existing logic takes care of any necessary copying   if so  can you remove it and the import of deepcopy ,1

32421,this was in place to get timeout behavior on the call  which i was thinking was necessary when sticking to nygards version of the circuit breaker  so if the call exceeds the call timeout that is   specified  that can be considered a failure      i can ce,0
32421,the timeout can be considered after the call returns it will not fail fast of current call  but the failure counter is increased  using future with await here is not an option  since it will consume additional thread resource,0
32421,all these should be durations,1

32456,hmm  now we have two versions of each process and array method  lets document why we need both  and when to use which,1
32342,actually why not create a generic slowloris like transport that buffers and randomly delays on sending bytes to test that sort of thing    then just run your test suite over with a different config ,1
32342,because were only testing  or  parts of the code and therefore only  or  tests should be needed if you want to make sure it works over many values you can just change the values  and  to   something more random or repeat it with a range of values ,1

32365,could you move this to  ,0
32365,most probably you need to use please check man  ebuild for that,1
32490,i would rather not impose the restriction that backing up globals be configured off there is no need for the to be in global scope  i think its better to unset here,1
32365,i think that would break setting s as the extracted folder has the architecture in it  im not sure what would be the best way to handle this,1
32490,im not quite sure what you mean this block conditionally injects a locator statically into a base test class so it can be used by any test class that extends it,1
32629,should this be here ,0
32629,its probably not a good idea to have the  variable switching from referencing a dom element to a string better to cache the id in a new variable,1
32632,could you change that to a case statement please ,0
32629,this needs a bit of work  itd benefit from being dried out a bit  since creating audio and video elements is a very similar process also needs to have checks for undefined values,1
32635,do not want this diff in the pull request,1
32088,the style used in the rest of this codebase for multiline blocks is to use  instead of curly braces,1

32648,it feels weird to say  if you for some reason have a commandline but not node but maybe thats just me,1
32647,i considered this  that would make us repeat the console  undefined condition in each line,1
32647,i can use the same code in initializing the module instead of having to repeat it here,1
32647,couldnt you just wrap it all in one check to see if console is undefined ,0
32647,what about the next guy who comes along and is messing with tests and has to rediscover it  i think its worth having the decisions about the code and its tests and building written in place,0
32608,i would have said it was the note object oid the one returned by  but now im a bit lost,1
32647,does your implementation of require in the browser use the identical implementation as node ,0

32647,originally it was i switched to in analogy with for arrays,0

32608,i think  we wont find any answer in the git doc  but we should at least try to figure out some answers  and then express them as  unit tests,1
32608,hey  you stole my questions smile     should the target of the note taken into account as well     the problem is that there is currently no way in that im awere of which can give us the target of the note nothing comparable to,1
32608, i think we wont find any answer in the git doc  but we should at least try to figure out some answers  and then express them as unit tests    well  the current unit tests would pass by using the blob id for equality tests  i think im hitting agai,1
32666, at least seems to pass even without your changes in  so i am dubious about the need for this pull request by the way is there an associated jira ticket ,1
32608,the problem is that there is currently no way in libgit that im awere of which can give us the target of the note nothing comparable to gittagtargetoid if you prefer    you could pass the id of the object being aspected to the  ctor and use,1
32667,these will just cause silly export errors lets remove em,1
32667,same as above these are useless here and will just give us errors,0
32666,as mentioned in the general discussion for the pull  this is no good we still want  when cloning it is true that  does not work  since the tag changeset is not part of the repo in that case,1

32682,you do not consistently check  for null when creating tags either do so  or make it nullable,0

32684,hmm  i wonder if you dont just want to return the query and let the caller fetch the results and turn them into a list  again im really really worried about the memory consumption of loading a bunch   of measurements into memory all at once also  a calle,1
32684,heres a case where you could iterate over results from the query returned by renamed to and serialize them one by one we would eventually change this code to construct the archive zip files on   the fly rat,1

32682,did you check for deserialization compatibility  ie run the old plugin  then update and browse this action using the new plugin  i think it will be ok just set to null by xstream but ought to check it,1

32718,unless this is used in more than one terminus implementation  we can squash it down into the actual hiera endpoint  we might as well do that  the code reuse through inheritance approach is not   awesome    assuming that there isnt some codified metapr,1
32718,so  the stubby tests are ok  but it would be great to have some tests that only run if hiera is installed  and that actually  do  the lookup  otherwise if the hiera interface changes we will totally keep   passing,1

32732,would it make sense to remove this file from source control ,0
32732,right the hit counter wasnt working  so i fixed it the database connection change was done to eliminate repeated code,0
32732,are you sure it should be written to   i never saw any html files written there should we just remove this script from source control  and you can keep a copy of it in case you need it later ,0

32829, lines here as well,0
32839,since the views are already separate classes  can we move the defaults into those classes as well ,1
32841,at first i thought this was unnecessary but it looks like you are only saving if the pools need to be updated  which is fine ,1

33384,rebundle revision and repository should probably be an input  please open a ticket and be mindful when you merge  or just make as an input now,1
33382,looks like keithtom created that using   seems to do a fake http action and compare the url with what is expected  something like an active resource version of,1
33373,fixed per your suggestion in ,0
33384,debug option is commented out in the configure script wont this cause a failure when we are automating the build of a dev image ,0
33382,ic  this was a spec that was broken so i was just trying to get it passing before i submitted the pr  i think garylin is aware of the  inconsistency,1
33382,one way around this would be to assign the id to a variable its used twice anyways and then the cardlink variable becomes pointless and can be removed        ,1
33394,we need to not have  or  anywhere in queries  especially since this code is completely open to be seen  its a security risk    this data needs to be validated    it happens a bunch of times on this page  as well as pages a,1
33077,thank you for the review  i added unit tests for  and also fixed a typo  ,1
33394,code can only be seen if youre logged in and have seo privileges i need this approved so i can show it to jo ann ,0
33084,why is this so separated from the rest of the ssl config  also why os the first option  afaik should be more widely available,0
33401,override kinetic scrolling in that case there might be others though,1
33401,if we receive a null move then we dont have to move period,1
33401,correct computation of the scrolling amount per your code  instead of the one adapted from qtlabs flickcharm,0
33401,when kinetic settings is overriden scroll directly    note that using the base class call introduces some flickering  ill look into that  it probably happens when the viewport height is even,1
33084,it used to be next to the zlib finding its earlier because i started earlier and id rather use that one ill change the order,1
33382,i commented out the call to below  and all the tests passed  this test doesnt seem to actually test anything other than that none of the code here throws an exception,1
33401,for this particular call we are resetting the documents position from   to where it was before we switched from another document,1
33382,as mentioned above  i dont think sets up any expectations and so i think this test doesnt actually test anything,1
33382,yeah youre rightdamn,1
33384,i left some of the stubs in so it could be finished later  there isnt any support for debug on rebundle asis  so there is no reason for someone to be setting that mode on the creator  we dont create   dev images on rebundle,1
33382,kind of seems like its just testing if the url is formatted correctly,1
33382,theres no real expectations so yeah  really only things that cause it to raise an exception  like a bad url maybe  like you mentioned  would get caught    i see that you were just modifying this and that it was already not testing anything  are you abl,1
33382,i talked to keith and it basically only testing that galaxy client can set the url correctly  headers  etc  since its only a unit test it doesnt test galaxy  it doesnt even seem like it gets back anything to   test for expectations     on the human si,0
33382,ah yeah  that makes total sense and it shouldnt do things like see if the user can authenticate afterwards    it still seems wrong to me that the test passes if i comment out the code being tested  there has to be some kind of expectation we can setup ,1
33384,added inputs for both and tested,0
33382,hmm what about this   ,0
33382,and in the    instead of nil in the return spot  we just return the http success thing,0
33382,if i change it to this  then it works as expected and fails if i comment out the call,0
33408,id make  a var somewhere instead of using a magic number,0
32148,below  you got rid of those  right ,1
33408,so does this actually work  even if doesnt find anything  it still returns a nonnull nonundefined thing,0
32839,was added in  specifically  but we never added general support for it to the templates or publicized its availability though we may have used it in stanfords custom templates so its safe to remo,0
33382,james  i just now saw your recent posts  checking that the response is success might be good enough actually    whatever solution you come up with  i think it needs to fail if the code being tested is commented out,1
33382,yeah makes sense  let me test that,1
33382,woo hoo,1
33411,what if the trigger is qrcode     higher level  why not just use handle remainder ,0
32148,if it ends in   it should return true or false  right   so   ,0
32355,the three below are the ones i dont like,1
32148,i meant the   i think its a good practice on uninformative args like true to use this technique to make the code readable  otherwise its really hard to remember what the heck that does,1
33405,what is the deal with the commented out stuff  does it need fixed or removed ,0
33382,azimux  what do you think ,0
32839,this was resolved in,0
32355,ya  i think theres room for improvement in our error handling in this arena in general,1
32148,i would kind of like to know if it doesnt,1
33382,just checked out the recent commits  i think those are much better   looks like itll fail now if the thing were testing is not executed,1
33382,i would change all  of these to lets and delete this before block    i dont have a personal problem with before but ive seen it heavily recommended that before be avoided due to potential headaches down the road,1
32148,i like the thought,1
32355,dry suggests we need something for them  renames may be a good idea  but the only other option is to actually repeat this code each time it occurs,1
32148,i vote to take it out  would prefer to use ruby extensions sparingly  because theyre kind of hidden  valuable for frequent patterns  but if its only a time or two and not super performance sensitive    id rather just do it inline,1
32355,my primary complaint is the type  this code has nothing to do with type per se    as far as i can tell  isnt used at all  so scrap that one    my suggestion would be that we add a  to the fetch module     as a go,1
32148,seems to be worthwhile doing  it appears that there were a few dangling references to this class that werent really valid anymore,1
32148,i thought i had added a new comment here  the ones below are necessary class methods  if you dont like the name  we can fix that  they are used in more than one place  so dry suggests a   method somewhere  and this seems the right place for it,1
32148,no  the point is you can test it for existence with nil   it will return the card if it is real  would you suggest a   postfix for the one that does the new below and make this one no postfix ,1
32148,i cant delete yours  so i will just mark like this    delete    and remove mine,0
33424,i think this is only on the initial photos  like background photos and the default profile pic  all users need access to those,1
33424,correct  is only used for the initial photos in  otherwise  we encounter the error i described in a previous comment,0
32148,i guess the convention confuses me because it is code  but it has no functional purpose  just as a comment  i put it back    delete,1
32148,nan,0
32148,well  right  the problem isnt that were explicit here  the problem is that we  have  to be  which means that we dont have a functioning userstamp on the revisions table  which we did have before    i think we need to get that to work,1
32148,im working on it  i suspect we may need to keep it around for a while so that migrations will run  ive had similar with the cardtype model,1
33428,this was causing link submissions not work  as the url of the reddit api and the input was the same variable name,0
32148,well have to carry this one forward as something we still want to fix,1
32148,this is implemented now ive also cleaned up as many of the references as i could    you can delete when you review this,1
32148,methods ending in   should be booleans  methods ending in   have two common meanings   ruby calling object will be altered  eg     rails raise error on failure eg    this isnt either of those    im thinking about f,1
32148,done added the codename to the error message for easier diagnosis,0
33434,should this be   im not seeing how we end up with a mimetype at your line  of ,0
32148,and test it ,0
33424,how about using the local variable user defined up there ,0
33424,oops  missed that when copying the conditional down,1
33309,note to self refactoring problems,0
32421,i dont really like the interaction with the error handling on this particular call  the thrown exceptions from the circuit breaker never make it back to the caller,1
33076,i added a task to this backlog card  remember user mode per file extension as a user when i open a file and specify a specific mode i want brackets to remember my descision,0
32148,as it turns out  i had to move more of the migrations up before the codenames one  because it uses all sorts of core wagn code to do its thing  it needs the table names and columns to already be the   new ones  so all the structural migrations go first  t,1
33445,why not do it here too just to make sure ,0
33382,how could i not do this after all smiley,0
33010,i think we could use some smart default based on the method name,1
33076,with glenns work for js inline editors we can i was keeping this around to get the context around the regex results ill remove it,1
33445,i thought about it  but one thing to another  wed really want to wrap every single i o calls lets keep it targeted to observed conditions for now hopefully  at some point well have a way to get the   site offline during updates,1
33445,seems safe to add these around all read operations  since they should be less likely to fail but sure if we want to fix each problem as it arises thats fine by me,1
33309,its in and appeared to be used once we went back to the wide version of openbook,0
33076,ill have a look and if its easy to replace ill grab them if not i will log a clean up task ultimately we probably want the language intelligence stuff factored out as a plugin that both clients can use,1
33309,added a line then deleted so no change,0
33309,its only as big as it needs to be while sets a defined size,1
33452,i dont think im familiar with what mpi is  the julia build process uses  to compile arpackng  they skip the build process and build only a subset of what they need  but i figured id make things as   general as possible so thats what i did ,1
33076,i like it  i wanted to move the list out of the way so the user can see symbol or line highlighting this looks much better,1
33115,no  still uses this argument you can check  for details,0
33115,   how automake can help in silencing make    to enable the use of silentrules in his package  a developer needs to do  either  of the following        add the silentrules option as argument to      call the macro ,0

33451,what will the cancel do  have you tested it ,0
33076,haha  that makes two of us i had to think about it too    i started with the comment  but then thought renaming the variable to fileinfo was more concise and removed the need for a comment,1
33451,yes i tested it and it reverts back to the previous state for all the fields associated with it,0
33463,it would be nice if youd test this  i put a check in so that it doesnt yell at me every time about there not being an ae checkbox p,1

33076,i wrote this before joels plugin code landed my intent was for quick open to make this interface public so a new plugin could call new on this and then register by passing an object rather than the   bag of functions do you think i should go with this ,0
33469,awww  i liked that space note this is funny,1

33469,can we get rid of it now  or is does invoke callback before function completion ,0
33469,followon from previous comment  is  guaranteed to invoke its callback argument after it returns   if not  then this is a regression that could cause the javascript is taking too long errors weve seen   on slow browsers read ie  give,1
33469,followup to my followup  whats the utility of here  ,0
33469, awesome  updates to test coverage  i did a cursory sampling  but love how many new areas were testing,1
33483,i think we should specify that a grey strip  without a name  is another nurses vacation segment and then should we be explicitly clear that just because theres a grey stripe doesnt mean that they   cant schedule ,1
33483,maybe link below to schedule a vacation segment ,1
33483,should we mention that deleting a unit will delete all the nurses vacations for nurses in that unit ,0
33483,should year be first ,0
33483,i dont think it matters at the end of manage nurses  i say to go to rules  and at the end of rules it says go to year,1
33490,fyi as of the updated cs for ezpnext that was made last year  we dont align lines like this anymore  as it makes diffs larger then needed  and makes it harder to do code refactoring but as you have   seen elsewhere not everyone is following it yet,0
33434,i guess it could be an unapply  but it should rather return an either then use fold in line      the match  uses the   then  of the case class,1

33507,fixed it in the next push  reused dir  ,0
33504,i guess you can simplify things and make the code more general  have a look to this simple implementation    i would expect to use a sourcemodel which is a container in this way  ,1
33515,the diff confused me as to what the intent was here  but after reading the code everything was crystal clear,1

33490,i know  but php does allow it   i asked docb about this way of hiding things from interface and he is ok with it,0
33535,ive added some inline comments around this  as its not very straightforward to read see merge commit,0
33457,lloyd  excellent note  i should have put that in there myself  perhaps instead of having a discrepancy with the upstream  i should just change upstream to pass the name of the message,1
33537,why the uppercase  i prefer lowercase  since thats how it is elsewhere and its easier than having to hold shift,1

32853,and didnt catch the case where the count is  this one does  and doesnt seem to catch other cases  so it might not be the best check  but works as we need i might not have reviewed all cases and   compilation regressions,0

33562,another tiny space just before the video,0
32853,this is also being optimized  as the compiler recognizes it as constant  even tough its stored as a variable     im not sure how to force this to be volatile  but in theory  the  check should deal with it ie break in case it is,1
32853,the  check aborts this case successfully  and none of the others  and none of the regression cases  too,0
32853,this part of the test is removed  since we cant compare it should be enough in the compiler tests  though,1
33568,the package name should be in the params file  even if its the same on all the platforms we currently support this will make any future porting to other platforms a little bit easier,1
33457,can we get a happy case test for this ,0
33575,this would fail with a name wrapsocket is not defined,1
33573,sorry  i forgot about responding to this  ive added a commit that deals with that now  thanks for the feedback,1
33570,i dont see stages used in this module  so not sure why it needs also rather than doing if   it can simply be include since its not a parametrized class,1

33457,this is accurate to what they were shown instead of us reparsing acceptlanguage headers,1
33537,rather not they are going to drop php versions so there is a pretty big chance that  will be on that list also there are some issues with that version on travis due to compatibility issues on ubuntu    so testing on  should be suffici,1

33299,it is more backwards compatibility we dont want to convert those arguments into post parameters because they will be named incorrectly,0
33537,this is mainly driven by what applies on my comment with regards   i still dont feel strongly on dropping this all together,1

33537,we should utilize mutator methods instead of setting the property directly not a big deal  but this way if we want to add some validation or something later  we dont have to go through and change   it later,1

33653,done  ive also removed some old debug code that was lying around for a long time heh,1
33653,true   to get and  to set would make the api a bit cleaner than it currently is  i already talked to stojg about this  and he didnt like the  etc either sminnee what do you think ,1
33537,committed a change that will allow the creation of setters if required  simply add a  method to the object and the rest is handled i do not like the idea of using setters for the sake of using setters   because maybe somewhere in the future,1
32789,well  the thing is join accepts any iterator  so you can use a generator instead of a list the following  expressions are equivalent actually  the generator ones should even be more efficient    ,0
33626,its because its looping over directories i moved it out of the loop,1
33668,if im understanding this line correctly  youre calling the method from the superclass  which is a nop that always returns false this seems like it would hinder performance for no reason or am i   missing something ,1
33537,well  we are now no longer testing against it and phpbb  is   i think im certainly leaning more and more towards requiring  or another  release,1
33537,thats a discussion for a different place  though you know my opinion on this matter and that hasnt changed just because i removed this line  this change is purely driven by the fact that i expect    to be dropped from travis and that will break th,1
33626,would have helped if i looked at the code ,1

33076,oops  this actually crashes now  it looks like someone made private  im fine with changing it to public again though,1
33668,nitpicky is good  makes the code better     id say dont merge yet  tomorrow ill try to improve the performance a  little and fix the tests im not sure about the dateutil  though  ,1
33693,actually  shouldnt this happen in llvm itself as part of the patching  this way any llvm application can work without changes to the source,1
33076,this part fell out of date a bit too the generic line and character properties have been replaced with a bunch of more specific values,1
33693,thats a lot more complicated  no longer an easy search and replace on llvm  ,1
33668,youre right  i think dateutil is probably necessary and the more i think about it  the more i want to put dateutil into the gpx code to improve consistency there ill have to benchmark that though  ill   only make that switch if its faster and it coul,1
32789,fair enough  ill make the required changes,1
32148,agreed  the good news is we have at least one test that will fail  so if we fix it  we can remove this and the tests will still pass,1
33693,wouldnt it mean you can leave the  alone  you would only have to change  to ,0
33076,looks like this is doing a casesensitive compare is that intentional ,1
33076,if you have two of the same selector in a file  i think this would only let you select the first one  seems like some work to fix  though  so if you want to spin this off as a bug im ok with that just let   me know when youve filed it,1
33693,actually  after looking it up  it seems you can only alias a namespace the compiler has seen a declaration for already so the right substitution to make would be something like    becomes,1
33693,hmmm that might work  ill try it    ,1
33693,note that there are more ways for namespace llvm  to get mangled by whitespace and not to be recognized  than there are for a simple replace of llvm  but ill give it a try    ,0
32148,the former is the  most common case  so i dont like that is is long and too complicated maybe for the one that is now   and leave the other alone   thats what i will do  then we change it again if you   have another idea,1
33693,agreed but theres also using namespace llvm to detect when using the other method    the good thing is that once done  we could recompile any llvm application without changes and maybe even submit this patch to the houdini folks   ,1

33786,so  every loop you register inotify handles  check for changes and reregister  i could be wrong  but it seems wasteful  and might not get some events in between the checks    i think you should init the inotify on constructor and clean on destructor,1

33899,we should use the enums here instead of the literal value,1
33899,same here  or we can just check the range and assign  something like        otherwise throw or n,1
33894,why did you change this ,0
33901,you should fix it as it is not valid phpdoc,1
33881,doesnt an empty it automatically become pending  or is the preferred style to actually say pending instead of it at that level now ,0
33900,this is very pretty,1
33894,i added the x because using the bootstrap the left hand column would have to be  or  when set to  with the x image  the image looked totally lost when using x on   the  width  the image overflowed too much that it over took t,1

33909,just a test  can you receive this  ,0
33881,and now that you mention it  im not sure what the right pending policy is here these are features that are nice to have but may never be implemented do we want to clutter the test output with   permanent pendings ,0
33901,fixed  hope thats what you meant i took it over from one of the other checks where its also wrong then,0
33792,i was trying it on live app by dropping in some puts and just refreshing page,0
33923,sorry  working in the same line of work is redundant uses work twice and too broad ,0

33909,net kept these methods for back compat and just added the get reference ones i can see since we dont have a huge backstory in java we could take this change  we should discuss further  ,1
33923,i agree about the attraction of piquant text  but do you see that job is misleading in this context  as if it referred to any particular job position   it will make people think if only i was a man  i would   get  more for doing this same job  which ,1
33909,also  we should add a convenience helper method on cloudtable to consturct a query against itself,1
33923,im using job and occupation or profession interchangeably here for the sake of brevity and simpler language  and i dont think its misleading  especially given the further explanation on the page,1

33879,nope the lockdown computer in my old engineering will have no attached blast doors  thats all ,0
33978,ya  its a bit of a hack  this function is only used on the search page right now  i need to perform those checks  so maybe i could move it into a search helper  so its not considered a base helper,1
33951,when is this flag true ,0
33951,why would summaries by null when you new it up above,0
33981,sensu  changes to a hash  so this will need to be updated  ,0
33980,mostly out of curiosity  but why change from  to  the whole object and then indexing it  do you ever need to get the properties that previously werent persisted  its not a big deal  but the previous   method used less storage,1
33980,i find this  to be weird usually get is paired with set  but here you have source as a combined getter setter  as well as get  unmatched with set,1
33980,this could be renamed to something more meaningful what does source mean  also  not a huge fan of introducing combined getter setters in this style of code,1
33986,you should inject the assuming the  naming and use to find the appropriate manager when using several ems in the project  and it will not work for people using both the orm and the odm in a project as it will s,1
33986,this will fail for a proxy iirc you need to give the entity class for find,1
33986,in my case i still use   so the code is still valid but it can be updated for ,1
33986,stof find is required here because you always point to a type that is an actual doctrine entity class   also  deserializing sets the valid directly  which does not load the proxy if i use instead  which leads to weird situations,0
33986, already have a in the doctrine bridge for the orm only so if your code is ormonly  it could use this interface some methods in it are deprecated in  as the doctrine common names are a bit   different but they are still there for,0
33986,oh  so it will always be the entity class name  not the proxy class name  ,1
33986,im going to update the code today then ,1
33986,btw  i think you should split it in different handlers the existing handler aimed at serializing all doctrine proxies with the same instance  and then another handler aimed at the deserialization  which   would need to be registered several times once for,1
33910,this should work fine  but you can just do ,1
33910,oh wait  im guessing that wouldnt work for some reason with the complicated joins,1
33910,yep thats right  doesnt work p,1
33992,i would drop any mention of support on natty or oneric,1
33677,it does happen code falls through and returns a  in the event of an error    is this considered bad coding style  i could see how it may be considered obfuscated,0
33991, is deprecated use  or  depending on what youre trying to achieve,1
33677,should use method to return a http  instead,0

33677, for error  for successful change  for idempotent operation that did not change anything,0
33677,but it isnt an internal server error  which is what a  response indicates to my knowledge whenever ive seen an  error  it typically indicates some kind of server fault    is there a precedent for this  or a reason i should change it  i could sen,1
33864,hashtag entities are under hashtags property  but each entity has text property to store the hashtag value  and only hashtag entity has text property    eg             ,1
33997,please learn the alphabet  s is before t yep ,0
33677,depends on the error  if the problem is that the request didnt pass validation  you want to send a  bad request error i think  unfortunately play doesnt have a handy method for that  so youd   have to set the response header manually,1
33998,yep  thats a good idea,1

33991,these booleans are not working correctly for me i am running lion i added this fake test to one of my formulas    ,0
33991,i will use macosversion      yes  this or  is the correct thing to do if you want to apply  on snow leopard     is actually snow leopard or greater  and  is just a wrapper,1

34005,im not going to accept changes that will change our public api to include hacks or workarounds    we just need to find better way to do this,1
33991, the flagrant offenders being the second and fourth lines    yeah  unfortunately  was historically defined as  which is a total misnomer unfortunately  it is probably too late to correct this behavior,1
34005,same goes into this one no special cases in long term these are going to make our apis unusable,1

33825,let me rephrase thatit wont raise from the pyapns server,0
33980,if you want i can change it back to setting each property individually but ive avoided this as each setting parses the json string into an object  sets the property on that object and then stringifies it   again this probably isnt really a performance is,1
33980,as ive said in another comment  getting actually parses the json string  so its just an optimisation parsing it just once  instead for each getter im not sure what  if any  the performance impact   would be to do it the normal way,1
33980,source provides easy and clean read write access to the underlying  string if you want i could split this into   or another name that you prefer ,0

34029,no need to indent the content of fenced code blocks however  you need to add the opening php tag otherwise the syntax highlighting would not recognize the code,1

34036,should we actually check a call to ruby v as well in case build fails partway  or does it not touch that dir till fully successful ,0
34036,does this have sufficient progress output to keep the capistrano connection open  or should we output the dots like we did for rvm ,0
34036,im not sure i like this for when you are upgrading the ruby version  there will be a portion of time when a previously set rubber profile is blanked out  maybe put this in its own file ,1
34036,we should probably just remove the rvm specific stuff and force an upgrade to rubybuild  while this script may work  other things might break since we removed rvm references from other places like crontab  etc,1
34036,used to be  we needed to use the system ruby here because the aws bundle script run on instance would not work with newer ruby  may not be the case anymore  but you should test this  ,1
34036,double check this still works  it never does whenever i make a change here ,0
34036,if thats the case  were going to have problems anyway because im pretty sure ubuntu  switched to ruby ,1
34036,i didnt have any problems compiling ruby p on an   but the dots probably make sense as a progress indicator if nothing else,1
34036,is this var no longer required  does it just use the ruby in the path   should we still hardcode it direct to the ruby we installed to be safe ,0
34036,im open to improvements here  but the only problem i see with overwriting the existing file is the path wont point to the old ruby  but  even with a separate file  it cant point to the old ruby    otherwise none of the gems will install properly  and i,1
34036,the wouldnt need to do the path in addition to say   just have the one file manage the path  ,0
34036,i guess  it just feels weird to have a file thats under rubbers management but isnt a template so it cant be customized by a user  but  its no worse than what im doing currently,1
34036,i commented on this  but im not seeing it now    part of the problem is this script is also run locally  where someone might very well be using rvm  maybe it doesnt matter there  but i figured id play it safe  if you know that it doesnt ill gladly,1
34046,this seems both unnecessary and inaccurate based on code below,1
34036,it will just use the ruby in the path  we could hardcode it to be safe  but it seemed like a potential referential integrity problem,1
34047,could you add some code to do something like    so  any args prefixed with  would only be passed with the jobname removed to one of the particular jobs   this is useful because there could be c,1
34047,couldnt we instead do    then i think you can make immutable and public  and you can also remove the other methods below  what do you think ,1
34036,ok  didnt think about the local use case  but in that case ones env is already setup by rvm when running from command line  this script is really only needed for running rubber from cron    if you can get things to work without forcing upgrade  go for,1
34047,i think we could do this instead with a companion object so you dont need to make mutable    so  ,1
34036,similar to  etc hosts that way i guess  always end up with problems like this when bootstrapping   ,1
34047,it would be nice  as you mentioned  to actually run a test job one that we already have  for instance    you are right  you will need to change this line,1
34052,very good but can you also change mirage so we do not have to use extra time in fixing it  too ,1
34056,id rather repeat whats in the function  once for precision errors  once for performance      ,1
34056,i dont understand this ,1
34057,i think you do need it in quotes,1
34057,should this say   or     or something to convey that it doesnt have to be the full note name,0
34057,oh  you do magic with ,0
34057,note sure if we want to document that usage in the future we may want to add arguments maybe,1
34057,get rid of the first gist here ,0
34057,i personally like not having to type the quotes  but yeah if it changes in the future we can update the docs  nonetheless  this is fine for now because it  does  work with the quotes anyway,1

34065,i like this new option a lot  but im not super happy with the name  i used episodes in the  record mode  but everywhere else in the vcr code base theyre called http interactions  and i think id   like to stick with that here  so mayb,1
34065,first off  i think errors should always have an explanatory message and not just a descriptive name  although thats important  too  the message here should include some details about what http   interactions were not used    secondly  i think its unne,1
34065,i think a different method name would make the intention here more clearmaybe  ,1
34065,this is pretty minorbut its good in doc comments to surround named code elements like options with backticks so they stand out as code elements  so this last line would have  rather than or   whatever,1
34065,id prefer this wasnt a public method  i want to keep vcrs public api as small as possible that helps me maintain it easier  you can certainly make this a private helper method  though  theres no   need for a test for it  either itll be implicitly ,1
34065,if you do keep this as a private helper method  itd be nice to use the  method rather than  directlywhen possible  its nice to use the pubic api even internally,1
34065,one other thing needs to maintain the same interface as a full   so whatever public methods wind up being added here need to be added there typically as a noop,1
34065,actually  thinking about this some moreit might be good to add a test for that have a test that finds all the public instance methods of  that were defined directly on it  and not on an ancestor  and   assert that  has a,1
34065,this should be  rather than   right ,1
33895,if you are refering to and   it was done so the unit tests would pass cli assumes you only are parsing args once per execution,1

34065,you mention that this option defaults to true as it should  but its actually not defaulting to true  it should be included in the default  see the  method in     alternately  if we come up with ,1

34127,i thought maybe its a bug referred to application code  not the language itself    i agree that bugs in the language itself are extremely rare    sent from my iphone,1
34127,yeah  i guess it is quite ambiguous  ill merge in the other changes shortly  thanks for the contributions ,1
34140,technically yes  but since  i think this clarification is needed ,1
34153,why to use when we can use  ,0
34140,yeah  youre probably right got a bit carried away by my random test cases ,0
34152,suggestion    note events may be raised by several threads  such as the gui thread and the audio thread  if a subscriber method calls operations that must be executed in a particular thread  then the subscriber   method is responsible for posting those c,1
34155,the file itself is fine  just github website has header   thats why it looks garbled this applies to all other nonunicode resources,1
34152,sounds good  we could also consider to document this at a central place instead of having this note on every event,1
34140,fair enough  how about returns  false  for primitive types  including   that way we clarify but dont imply that  is not a primitive,0
34116,there are five other instances in this file of the url being quoted and relative to the current file rather than unquoted and relative to the base i like the change made here  but please make it   everywhere else as well consistency is important,1
34116,please remove these comments if these comments are still valid  create a new ticket against puppetdashboard and elaborate on the comments there,0
34122,can we add another example as well that uses  instead of  to make it super clear that we are passing the variable name as argument ,0
34122,one option is to not match against each specific block but simply do this,0
34122,the  and  handlers have different third argument it is a minor difference in this case  but i would still like to keep this explicit for now when it comes time to adding more verbs  ill be able to refactor   ,1
34122,give me a second,0
34176,hmmm shouldnt this be implemented in  and then post could just do a noop ,0
34177,same as in l,0
34177,there is no need of is i think that checking should be enough,1
34176,should add this logic to the model or maybe we should even break creating a status message to some sort of factory object ,1
34176,i still dont know what this does differently than built in jasmine mocks any idea opinion  denniscollective ,1
34184,can you add public in front of the method ,0
34183,could you move this to the previous line   else  ,0
34186,the date should be updated,1
34152,either way is fine with me  but lets make it very noticeable since this is a concern thats both common and subtle,1
34189,i think it would be cleaner to stick this in a utility function at the top of this file  then anytime it is needed   can be called,1
34189,same as above  this should be moved into a utility fn,1
34189,it looks like this file was out of sync with the changes i recently made to it this set of changes is also removing a feature that was recently added,1
34189,perfecto    sent from my iphone,1
34200,fix is here  ,0
34152,ok  lets keep it like that so the ide will tell the programmer when he actually uses the event,1
34207,for information  and aptitude permits the use of the flag y to use the yes  ,0
34209,instead of changing the level here  i would move the level map to the handler to be consistent with other handlers,1
34211,we shouldnt will need to figure out what tests break and fix that,1
34211,we depend on memcache for csrf now but we might be able to fix that with a local settings change,0
34211,is definitely not required for minimal hacking i rarely run it at all,0
34209,this will duplicate many things as  contains the normalized record it should probably be limited to     thus  looking at the raven client  it seems wrong the params array is meant to contain params to f,1
34209,i dont think forcing to use the stacktrace is a good idea it should be configurable in the constructor,1
34209,while having a convention about the way to provide exception in the context to allow a special handling is fine  im concerned with this implementation it will log only the exception and drop the log   message which could be better to understand the issue,1
34218,should be able to get rid of the conditional        works on mri  and  ,0
34219,i dont really get whats the point  by default is highlighted   anyway  the code seems to work,1
34224,is there any reason to not make this private ,0
34227,im not sure that i like doing this via a method why not just mix in all the proxies when we include the module ,1
34226,can we get rid of the redundant local variables here  function     also  i think youre overdoing the comments a bit here get rid of the loop over x comments,1
34227,i love that we can pull that condition out now,1
34226,this is going to break on ruby         this should work on both    ,1
34227,if youre going to change the text  it should be method selection not the larges of deals also   is better here  i totally agree,1
34227,why did you choose this over  ,0
34227,i would say includes and not receives here,1
34232,the arrows should be aligned and those strings in double quotes should be in single quotes as per the puppet style guide,1
34233,shouldnt this be replaced with assignment to setter rather than just remove the line ,0
34232,uh  doesnt look right remove the quotes,1
34232,for me just says linux which is not very useful at all,1
34235,pull down on to next line for consistency,0
34235,that was already there  i just moved that line baby steps p,0
34224,use  the  new,1
34224,could we add a couple of specs for eg  as well  add something to the page that calls using  both the success case and the timeout case should be tested ie to make sure  is invoked corr,1
34232,confirmed  what is the expected osfamily of arch  probably archlinux right     basically if its not redhat  debian  suse  or solaris  it falls back to    one could argue that arch deserves its own    i guess the only problem is that since osfami,1
34232,there will need to be more arguments passed here eventually i use source  gem in my manifests   is there a puppet equivalent  of  or  or some way to take an arbitrary number of arguments to a define ,1
34239,this sort of stuff concerns me a bit  we have lots of hardcoded references to file locations this wont work in any of my applications for example    i dont have a suggestion for an improvement right now other than we list stuff like this in accompanyi,1
34239,thats from the older version phil i just copy paste this xml  and only tweak the test directory  since ci did not have some generator   i think we need some console interface  to autogenerate the   file  based by what dev want t,1
34232,i am pretty sure that there are no such things as in the puppet dsl maybe if we wrote it in the ruby version of the puppet dsl,1
34232,arch is significantly different from any of the above  not based on anything else nor do i know of any derivatives anyways  should say something like archlinux or arch  and probably should fall   back to     can we fix,1
34253,if we start adding helper functions for headers like this  would we not need to start adding a whole lot more  expiry dates  cache settings  language  etc ,0
34254,shouldnt we keep the entryutility class  we still have the entrymeta in entryheader or should we have two entrymetas ,0
34253,agreed  i set headers on a request more often than setting content,1
34257,why a at the top level  its already in ,0
34256,i would default to an empty array here if it doesnt exist,1
34259,space between  is missing,0
34251,should this use for consistency ,0
34251,any answer to this question   seems like you might be duplicating some level of checks that would run below,1
34251,can you add a little bit of description comments are fine as to why the outcome of each test is as you expect   ie should fail because authoritative and attribute not reachable  should decline   because not authoritative and not reachable  etc so the,0
33872,the change should take place in soosim  so the above code would subsequently change to  doing the small step by default would not change thi,1
33743,this makes it very confusing i always wanted to get rid of this notation can we just squash it with rows  instead of splitting it up  also  i think some of the options could directly be be   placed in the parent module except for the objectman,1
33743,i think the entire class could be stripped if we dont provide additional code what do you think ,1
33743,did you try to dump definitions for this class  i dont think the class definition is really needed as s runtime definition would probably discover the same values,1
33743, is probably wrong here  as this method doesnt need to be called every time it is already required in the constructor,1
34268,place braces on their own lines,0
34268,please add original test case that is in bugzilla,0
34269,please add issue number as a comment,0
34270,this should be part of an other pull request  i guess however  as ospf capability pull request has already been accepted  there is no need to split this one in two,1
34274,i dislike this change  although it gets more compact it also gets less understandable ,1
34270,this method signature is likely to change in the future  accepting a connection  or a however  its not the goal of this pull request to fix that  but only to provide current functionality from a java   interface ,1
18919,prabhuramachandran the migrations had to be removed due to problems with taggit library there is no known solution as of now ,0
34277,but you allow signing of non receiving addresses here  no ,0
18919,hardythe  jayparikh please comment on this line as it is not self explanatory,1

34259,hum  it actually also works without the space  ,1
18919,try to get a true false instead of count using bool,0
18919,instead of using the same logic in multiple places  make a function that checks if a user is moderator or not,1
34288,can you put the call on its own line ,0
34288,can you remove the space behind the  and put each statement within the if block on its own line  closing curlies also belong on their own line,0
34278,nan,0
34286,this needs to go before the pull request can be accepted this is just to show off,1
34288,lgtm good find ,1
34286,in reality has no dependencies this is just to show off,1
34286,also note here that if you wanted a specific branch youd just do        neat  of course any flag can be passed here,0
34286,this slot needs a better name something like  or something,1
34286,could use a better name ,1
34286,this could be turned into a method and thus be a lot smaller and easier on the eyes,1
34286,gotta find a way to not print out the cloning bit,1
34286,in the future this will be handled with  at which point we wont need the recursive mess wont even need this whole thing ,1
34286,consider starting with just  and adding more specific stuff like  and  after youve demonstrated an actual need,1
34254,outside of a bottom margin on entryutility they were styled identically  to target the former entryutility you could use  probably could go either way  but i thought it was redundant to have    separate classes  ,1
34286,isnt the  convention pretty well established ,0
34286,why is this configurable ,0
34309,could you please start each title with a capital letter and end with a full stop and empty roxygen line ,0
34309,this function should invisibly return the old path,1
34309,can you please make sure you have a space after each comma  and around  ,0
34315,its better to use  here  so that the env vars are restored even if theres an error,1
34315,i think you should make the arguments match  exactly,1
34286,this is getting piped directly to the git clone command  so if git clone supports  then thatll work ,1
34286,one part me breaking up the code into smaller chunks and one part me thinking someone might want to be able to change it in the future  say if some other moving part is using ,0
34323,have we gained an extra  unnecessary level of indenting here ,0
34286,takes a  object and pulls updates dependencies other setup moving parts could also be shoved into this method,0
34325,we need to disable the cache while this runs  to avoid a nasty bug    also  we should resave them all after  to   be sure it fixed the bug   retrigger all the caching we didnt allow to happen,1
34286,what i need is a paper blog series whatever that talks about cpan  rubygems  npm  pip  and maven a lot of my foundation comes from having only really interacted as a publisher with rubygems,0
34326,the main suggestion i have for this code as it is now is for you to try and move this functionality down into and have assemble the data upon request from its child package objects  in the same way   that  d,1
34326,perhaps this is premature but id like to see this logic elsewhere  mainly because its confusing the role of  perhaps the object can do more of this,1
34326,as a side note  you mentioned in  about the use of  all over the place youll find that its main use is not to assign  but to curry additional arguments to functions that need to be passed around    so we dont end up with callbacks with,1
34323,to be honest  im still struggling a bit with enders code formatting conventions actually trying to reconstruct this for this post  i think that even one more level of indenting is need here    before,1
34326,one problem we have is that we leave it up to the templates to decide whether to indent or not which youve obviously discovered  i think perhaps the best way to deal with this is keep track of   which was requested by the templates this can be done he,1
34328,im a little concerned by this its a big slowdown for proper databases  just to let test databases work better i wonder if theres a way we can catch this error for and fix it  or a databasespecific   switch pretty hacky  mind    alternative,1
34330,i know nearly nothing about r  but why do you need to create a variable just to return it immediately   wouldnt       work the same     also and pardon again my i,1

34323,oh  of course  because you added another function  yes it goes in yet another level when you have another child thats an annoying inconsistency that still remains in the code formatting  maybe well   decide to always indent at that level whether theres ,1
34330,  would look so much nicer  if you ask me,1
34330,in other repos languages we have the convention of always finish the file with a new line  in case you want to adopt it,0

34352,that might make sense  sure  it wont be sourced unless that symlink is in place,1
34340,i was just guessing seems like node should have support for os independent paths by now,1
33972,hmm after adding the  wrapper were only left with a string giving users a dom tree to manipulate seems much more friendly than forcing them to deal with html source    ,1

34507,i was forced to read the rubydocs because i couldnt figure out how to easily compare elements in an array and see which had a higher value in this case  an integer greater than the other what   would be the more conventional way  to use inject        ,1
34505,what about filtering by type  and  tag  ,0
34505,i would use to be sure not to overwrite some previous condition,1

33786,adding method  to determine how much to read when flushing the queue  now its possible to allocate enough buffer space to read the entire queue in  pass  ,0
33786,this method is not currently used  but maybe useful in the future to determine the number of events in the event queue  currently  all events are flushed,1
34507,you could sort and then take the highest value maybe something like        to see what this is doing  try a simple example    ,1
33786,only directories will be added to the inotify watch  it will be up to the client that calls to determine if the file directory that changed was the one of interest,0

34525,temporary doesnt need to be capitalized  right ,0
34527,dna and fingerprint hashes are not the same,0
33786,yes  it is possible to miss changes that occur between calls to   this is the current behavior of   if there is no change and the timeout expires  then a file directory is changed between the subsequent   call to cf,1
34254,i saw that geek cred to you    but isnt the pull request simpler then  seems like it to me  if you write in your commit message somewhere  github will automagically close the issue for you very handy,0
34505,didnt consider it as being used at the time but now that you mention it i am adding a refactoring to allow the possibility,0
34505,agreed is now part of the approach for the allowance of both tag and type,1
34254,well the pull request was saying the source was different now since the upstream master had been changed by merging in another of my pull requests  so it suggested this as an alternative method    it definitely was a pain doing it with the ,0
34507,i couldnt get this to work  i keep getting wrong number of arguments  for  for sort i checked the docs but im not sure whats exactly happening with  im assuming its a proc which is basically   just a block of code and youre passing i,1
34505,does this method return a query builder   if yes  it should be renamed as it is rather confusing it has the same name than doctrines magical method returning an array,0
34542,should probably specify that  is for tcsh and export is for bash  and also say that people should add these lines to their or so they dont have to run them all the time,0
34542,might help to add  before this  and possibly add  before the svn co line,1
34505,i agree that is a legacy method that i did not dare touch without a thorough search,1
34505,even if this code is not part of the changes  it is not safe this uses string concatenation to set the ids  not a query parameter  you should be writing are ava,0
34507,oh right  i its   either way  thats active support magic that calls on each object in the array  then sorts by it,1
34544,ideally  id like to see this formatting  ,1
34505,this should be of type to be consistent,1
34505,searched code and renamed method,0
34505,i did not know because you feed it an array i assumed it was escaped by doctrine,1

34544,i think we decided on a fix  no ,1

34507,sweet  thx that got it working ,1
34554,the value in the exception message should be received  not   another spot i missed when i converted to an array of chunks     i see  the  call still worked because it was always asking for more than remained ,1
34555,i believe the newly introduced newline production should be used here as it is used bellow in other places this form would not work on posix platforms where the    is normally not present in the text so the parser will reject the  source,1
34556,doesnt this fail in the  case in english and print  questions in the last  days  in polish  this fails in the  and  cases i think thats right,0
34555,yes  this is imo the correct cross platform way,1
34556,wowthats so cool  i never thought of doing that,1
34556,shhh  i hate putting css in the html but i dont see any other good option here ,1
34556,you are right  we need to handle that ill search for a similar case in the codebase,1
34555,this changes the semantics a little bit and im not sure if it will not break something original version expects the pattern to end with    to support windows i think the re should be    or simply the parenthesis are not necessar,1
34555,semantic change this will allow non escaped spaces in the definition im not sure if lex flex allows that one problem i can think of is a dangling space at the end of a definition that may produce   some headaches when debugging as it is kinda invisible,1
34556,this is a little goofy  but id put  here instead of  since thats definitely outside the boundary i cant tell if its possible for the timings to be such that theres an edge case where it ends up being   inside the boundary and shows up in the from,1
34555,do the added parenthesis serve some other purpose above improved readability  i noted one of your commit mentions a bug if this is a the bug i fail to see it please help me ,0
34555,all the three lines change semantic thats ok if necessary or if it improves something  which i dont know otherwise i would suggest to only prepend  before the    in the original version please comment,1
34555,those  lines above seems ok to me,1
34568,has this been removed for a reason  it was added in to handle elements with a negative scale value,0
34556,true  i dont want to add any test cases that fail randomly,1
34555,again  this is not only allowing    to precede     but it changes the semantics eg    accepts  one of     or     but i think the intent is actually   put together the correct re seems to me to be       which will perform as b,1
34569,this using statement got misplaced,0
34569,could replace  with either  or  the former would probably be more efficient  since the latter would be a single option character class,1
34570,for a comment like this that describes what the method does  go ahead and use a ,1
34570,i would call this parameter  since we dont know if its a shake id yet,1
34570,hmm  you might consider checking if the shake name is a number  and if it is assuming its an id so you can skip the extra api request looks like there are some shakes  such as  that are named with   numbers  but since you can ,1

34570,i would go ahead and  here  so you can avoid the vaguely named  variable entirely,1
34570,i would call this  both to be a little clearer what it does with sharedfiles  and in case we need to add a  command later somewhy    then it would be clear enough to omit the descriptive comment above too    hmm  you might,1
34570,when interpolating one thing into a string  the parentheses arent necessary  so i omit them i would write that     you might be interested to know you have to include a comma to make a singleentry tuple  so it evaluates as ,1
34570,could you change the  description to describe the  command here ,0
34570,i would call this parameter  in which case the  description would be something like the api endpoint to call,1
34570,the output might appear cleaner with  and ,1
34570,as for the  command  these help descriptions should include a verb just adding list the to all of them as in s would be great,1
34570,since this can be a name too  i would call this argument simply   and describe it as id or url name of the shake to list,1
34570,the method name  is pretty clear  so i would omit this comment,1
34570,could you add the spaces around the  in this assignment ,0
34570,the  interpolation operator wants for some spaces too as above  since theres only one thing interpolated  i would write it ,1
34570,as above  id omit this comment,0

33986,symfony does not split the use statement into several groups,0

34593,which documents should be applied is a correct from i think,1
34593,could you write utility function like   instead  that way you wont need to beak and it would by way easier to follow it took me a while to figure out what was going on here,0
34232,theres archserver but it hasnt made it into facter or past beta    we could pull request facter to fall back to operatingsystem instead of kernel  ,0
34372,should this return after  ,0
34593,please add a space before ,0
34372,think this comment is out of date,1
34326,well this is another reason that putting some of the dirty source map logic into makes sense  because so much of what it needs to know is in there  including the indent character count  asks all its s   for s,1
34593,do you really need an iterator here   i think plain arrays map   reduce would work just fine here as you iterate over each tab anyway  also it wont require nonstandard features making it easier for newcomers ,1
34593,you only seem to use  and  so whats a point of adding  and  and use of getters are even more confusing,1
34593,i would very much prefer to have more utility functions than this complex iterator for example we already have utility function for getting window tabs    i think,1
34372,do we need to keep track of  at all   since were walking from the front back cant we just keep a  of how many weve popped     also  in the same walk of the list  once  is  we can exit the loop  allowing us to just write out what,0
34372,would be helpful if we turned the above  lines into a little new helper function to be used here and internally by ,1
34597,why is this instead of msg ,0
34605,please put these back in the  function  for now,0
34570,i like this this suggestion and if you are ok with my previous comment  will return the value of the argument after the for loop no names matched,1
34570,my thought here was this  if the shake argument matches a shake name even if its numeric  it should be converted to that shake   if it cannot be resolved as a known name  then assume its a shake   id and proceed  the error handling of handling it as a sh,1
34603,im not sure if anything in this method is necessary the reason i do this with is because i need to convert between different formats say  a date like   to an date format so this is there i   would do that transformati,1
34603,rather than passing  here  i think you should be able to just say ,1
34603,one thing that would be cool is if we could specify the maximum number of characters in the text output so if we said   then the code would automatically wordwrap everything to  characters   when generating text output otherwise the text,1
34570,nice attention to detail there  thanks for the tip on the      i was curious about the apparent ambiguity,1
34603,so  we have contact information and education what about job experience  etc  maybe add those to the input json file  and incorporate those in the plain text output ,0
34570,nice style   i was also trying to mimc the wording of the api docs did you help write those ,1
34570,works for me  i wasnt sure if preserve the original order of keys and whether that would be useful or not,1
34570,i like switching to shake in this situation,1
34570,missed that one  sure thing,1
34570,yup  easier to let the code speak for itself,1
34570,i ran into a problem with using an optional argument   it could have been a bug in my original implementation  ill revisit that in a subsequent commit,1
34227,maybe im missing something here  but as far as i can see  were not able to use  here because     these proxies have to be defined in the objects singleton class  so each decorator has its own proxies which is obvious because defining meth,1
34616,try to refrain from using p or x as variable names in ruby   would be easier to read in a couple of months,0
34614,good job actually cleaning up the discussion here  we also need to clean up choices and votes however  we could probably take care of all of these with attributes on the models,1
34614,um  where did this whole file go  you were probably trying to keep top secret stuff out of the public repo  which is a good goal however  i think we should talk about the best way to do that,1
34614,yeah  im not sure what was going on there,1
34614,so this is actually in the   but for some reason it wasnt being ignored,0
34614,that is how you do block comments in coffeescript,0
34616,i would either move this up to   or into a select statement    ,1
34614,ah  i think youre right i think i added it to the   but then never actually git rmd the file this is probably fine then  since there are the and files still in the repo for examples,1
34614,isnt this whole think block commented out ,0
34570,when with for added clarity and to disambiguate from temporary for shake in shakes,0
34614,yeah  i need to clean up some of the unused code  sorry ,1
34614,yeah  i was looking into that  im a little rusty on rails  so this was an easy way to get it done  ,1
34614,ahhhh makes sense when i actually preview the file you can just get rid of the unused code no need to keep it around in block comments,1
34542,in this sort of documentation  it is always good to reference directories with the environment variable previously defined  ie  ,1
34614,no worries  good job cleaning up some of our mess  haha,1

34756,accepting here makes it harder to reason about calls to this factory without adding much can the passthrough be explicit ,1
34756,rather than moving these from the api module  this should probably introduce usefullynamed encoder decoder pairs or factories for same that are invoked in api to build the default one the and ,1
34756,using different guessthemimetype approaches depending on whether the resource has a name or not seems like it would lead to surprises are you sure that mimetypes cant interrogate a stream    so as to at least use a subset of the same logic in the strea,0
34756,does this end up preserving the whole path where we actually want the basename  ,0
34756,surely theres a library for this,1
34251,youre duplicating core httpd functionality now using  here is the right thing,1
34756,the same remark from about randomly rearranging symbols applies to this encoder decoder pair,0
34757,i probably wouldnt leave the check here a stronger test would test that something happens when you pandafeed as it is  line  doesnt build upon the line  test,1
34756,this could use some elaboration of the expected xml and http entity  maybe  you can infer it from the test  but its not very clear if youre not already intimately familiar with refreshbooks request  concocting magic,0
34756,instead of regex shenanigans  what about patching out and returning a predictable value ,1
34756,this isnt any clearer or terser than a  named  lambda isnt a net win,1
10152,d    gotta keep it light haha,1
34723,allright  will do  thanks for the feedback,1
34756,please keep files empty can this go into a separate module within the package  nonempty package init leads to some unnecessarilyconfusing behaviour around package and module initialization   its harmless  bu,0
10152,you could do this in this case  a simple way to see what this is doing  or  now that i think about i,1
34756,  the magic underscore is noisy,1
34756,can this be a comprehension  map   lambda  ow  stylistically,0
34756,id like to introduce you to  ,0
34756,does this behave itself properly with multiline headers  what does do with them ,0
34756,named nonoptional positional arguments  again,0
34251,comments and more tests added,0
34251,can you help me understand what i need to replace   the docs on that function are pretty opaque and its implementation is just an indirection layer  so its not clear to me what  precisely  is being   duplicated,0
34641,im sure youll recover somehow ,1
34403,i expected such a redundant implemented code  too when you accept my claim  it will be difficult to avoid it thank you for your work ,1
34758,this is fine  i mostly had this in as a placeholder,1
34758,probably want to make sure this is sanitized,1
34758,it would be nice if were a bit more verbose of a method name,1
34758,the two text strings here linked user and no corresponding user should use translation functions,0
34758,whats this value from ,0
34765,seems like you should be able to combine this and line  into a simple jquery selector,1
34747, do we really need this method    i am also a little towards it i am wondering whether this was a specific fix for something ,1
34766,i dont see this happening in the migration,1
34766, has        but the schema never got checked in,0
34646,i hope these arent real keys,1
34768,this comment should really be a comment introducing the method plus add yuidoc tags,1
10152,nice  i knew there had to be a better way thats awesome array support d    just looked up shuffle basically it shuffles and since there are only two it would be them in  and  if there were  in the array  would it throw an error or just stuff ,1
34372,moved to ,0
34769,is a  necessary here  i think  will be enough wdyt ,1
10152,check it ,0
34768,why does this  method exist   where how might it be used ,0
34769,mmmmmmmmmm im not sure exactly  is nice because were essentially calling context on a list  and so we get the list back,1
10152,love it ,1

34777,talked to avi  we can restructure this if we ever get to the point where attributes are going to have fields that variants dont,1
34758,two less lines to just apply the filter to the class variable noting to fix later,0
34758,we should have a helper function for determining whether guest authors is enabled noting to update later,1
34758,netaustin did you test this thoroughly  seems like the sky might fall on our head,0
34758,cant stick a variable inside the translation function theyll need to be translated outside,0
34779,can we do something like    so that end users can set it via a dropdown on the page  like pastedance does,0
34756,there is  its even builtin ,0
34769,ya i liked  in this context since its working with a list but  would work too ,1
34780,i am curious whether we could make this less antisocial consider folks who have provided their own overrides  or folks debugging node core good enough for now though ,0
34780,im not sure i understand  of the concerns  but perhaps we could blacklist only specific function name   filename combinations,1
34780,i should try this in a browser too i bet i want to filter out native code or something like that,1
34781,space after the comma ,0
34781,no space between  and ,0
34781,probably should use the domready test from the tests and use  or something instead of php ,1

34781,youre mixing spaces and tabs in this file probably convert everything to  spaces for consistency,1
34781,thats probably my fault btw ,1
34781,too many spaces p,0
34461,the  indentation of the file is correct we think this is related to github indentation algorithm error,1
34544,no good reason i just removed it,1
34758,yes is the default for new posts  which already have an id and a i tested turning off and on as well,1
34782,i had to run the tmvc t template again and it cleared out these extra spaces theres a bunch of these  i suggest skimming past them ,0
34461, and  in kfold crossvalidation  we just create one monitor this monitor monitors each fold distinctly and if we dont reset the monitor  we get wrong total number of batches we want to see only   the number of batches for one fold     it will more,0
34783,is statics last a spring convention  my ctrlshifto puts them at the top,0
34783,not sure   this is what mine did  do you want me to change it ,0
34783,i guess it really doesnt matter  but theyll keep bouncing around if we dont agree on a convention,1
34783,lets do this can you reorganize them with your settings and send me via email your order of imports and ill adjust for future,1
34085,currently kernels do need to associated with a notebook  we could relax that assumption  but i think it is a separate issue,1
34784,a vector is not necessary please remove it    this code converts the data twice first  the incoming string is converted to a which only requires a   btw  and then the vector is converted to json format please update code to conv,0
32482,is it possible to make the frequency  time  and retention of backups more configurable  perhaps make the cron time settings configurable and incorporate logrotate to make retention configurable,0
34461,this case never happened but we will change it for a raise instead of a warning,0
34781,i passed all the files with the autoindent of my editor webstorm probably missed the html one  ill check,0
34781,yep  thats probably the best things to do also to check load domready order,1
34786,use an extra table to make your tests this break everything ,0
34461,we will change it for a raise instead of a warning,0
34787,you dont need to do  just instead of having the empty seq as a  create a new constructor that has  parameters and that delegates the empty seq to the param constructor,1
34787,i started down that path but migration manager flagged that things like and unapply would no longer be compatible i dont think any client  code should be doing that  but who knows should i go ahead and ignore  those     thanks  srp,1
34681,yes  that assertion was also in the and and i was making them match if it needs to be removed then ill remove it from all three,1
34785,this use statement is useless the class is already in the same namespace,1
34085,i dont understand  isnt this coupling precisely the issue this pr is meant to resolve ,0
34461,do you use values in the monitor to determine which hyperparameters to select as part of the crossvalidation algorithm  thats almost certainly very wasteful because it forces you to compute the   validation error at least twice when its only necessary to,0
34768,today  with mustache  we can add  and call for to get the stringify version of the template  and pass it to the client side if we want to use that there    with handlebars  we should be able to do the exac,0

34768,agreed  i will adjust it,1
34787,no  i meant    doesnt that work ,0
34085,i thought this pr was resolving the issue of cells being coupled with execution requests  now  you dont need a cell to execute some code and get a result,1
34785,cs issue the curly brace should be on its own line,0
34790,do these paths need to be updated ,0
34789,we can just remove these no need for commented out code here,1
34628,yes  thats exactly what they are,0
34785,what if the file does not exist  ,0
34787,i tried the following  but the compi,0
34790,nope  those  are  the updated paths,0
34461,no we  dont use the values in the monitor to determine which hyperparameters to select as part of the crossvalidation algorithm ,0
34085,this pr is meant to decouple the code cell  kernel  and notebook objects in javascript  it doesnt change the weak coupling in the notebook server though  that is a separate issue  ,0
34085,the general goal is to resolve the unnecessary coupling of kernels  notebooks  and cells  part of that is using the kernel  alone  no notebook  no cells as a javascript library for remote execution    i should note that i did a test  and it does seem ,0
34542,i think putting in angle brackets it just going to confuse people  whats that supposed to mean ,1
34085,if i understand things correctly  decoupling the notebook and kernel is effectively what we did with the sage cell server any webpage can embed a single cell and execute code as part of that single   cell  and in fact  any webpage can just call the,1
