pull_request_id,body,Agrees
16311,i agree with brad either the  complete  experience  or an unadorned pagerefreshing experience i think a partiallyworking automatic filter would be confusing,0
16378,added test to ensure single class is passed multiple classes gave false positive ,1
10755,thats fine for now i may merge them if i get some time,0
16402,this is a minor bug fix  should be   ,1
8214,done renamed timestamp to freezedate    im actually setting builddate to the actual day that the image is built because it can differ from the freezedate,1
13740,can we use something more descriptive than  and  ,1
16412,remove space after commas,1
16422,i think you might need to prefix the string with  like above  because of some other processing we do later on the chain with error messages    also  if we dont allow the comma at all in a collection title  the reserved string    doesnt make sense  sin,1
15707,yep  you are right  the problem is that we dont know if more headers have been added  another option is to create a refresh method and call it from outside every time a new header is created removed  makes sense for me,0
16414,heres that bug i was talking about pipe character is a regexp special character needs to be escaped to match,1
14904,good catch  thought i got everything  ,0
15343,good catch  ill fix the debug message in ,0
16414,this should be changed to so we can have  ,1
15316,will fix  i didnt read the contributing file before contributing ,0
15932,i think id like to either do this  or remove the comment if theres a need for the method to change  well feel it anyway,1
14904,can you make this protected   also s they the in the comment,1
15932,we could probably make this change in   unless it was accidental ,1
16455,the type of is  this is not fixed  let me know if its ok ,1
15932,raising within a template is  i think  unprecedented in this codebase  so itd be good to understand a bit more about whats going on is this to defend against  calls which forget to set it in their    options ,1
16466,because the for loop starts at   it will loop once for instance  if someone picks the dates    and    and chooses to recur on monday  no loans would be added  because the time span is   for one day  which is a thursday similarly  if the user cho,1
15932,i think we could probably use a stronger selector here this will match any other link that happens to use the organisation name,1
16455,nah  object should be fine all objects are of anyway if phpdocumentor complains  well change it,1
16123,why did these need to change  the fact that it didnt break any tests means we have some untested and unverified cases here as well,1
13740,jeffheifetz i vote we dont use a status flag at all see my comment about editing the existing keepsource flag,1
16123,i feel like an option passed in with the request would make more sense if you want to enable it globally it could be an option to initialize as well this should not be the default as it breaks backwards   compatibility,1
16210,i believe this expression would be easier to understand it reduces to one level of parens and drops the confusing and      ,1
16495,this could be dryed up in a similar manner to the in the controller  since the always has the same value  and only the value of the changes    so  something like,0
16537,same as above  this will only work for plugins and not cues if this is intended  ignore this comment,1
14864,this is  a  every time because  is not defined maybe it belongs further down  and should be checking  instead ,1
16537,can you define a plugin that has no function definitions and still have it work  just to make the test smaller,1
15334,lets put this in a view instead ,1
15334,id remove a lot of stuff here since it is an example ,1
15334,ha  lets remove credits ,0
13912,this is fantastic news ,0
15334,lets skip this and move to cli directly ,1
15995,it has now been moved to,0
15995,it has been placed on its own line,0
15334,can you add the driver config here ,1
14624,maybe inline error into the table  like unauth,1
15334,lets also add  to check that all entities are there,0
11557,since we know that this will happen if the original post is not there can we either   a log out a more helpful exception  b handle it without the try catch using and then just discard the reply if we dont have the original,1
16565,is this import needed  thats the default i thought,1
11557,if were doing this now using a timestamp do we need the property at all ,1
11557,was this change also applied to replies  only ask for replies after the timestamp from the last received,1
16575,all taken care of,0
16499,ive found it useful it lets you type this  instead of this  but maybe im using them in a different way than originally intended  i often use them ,0
14550,is set to true  if we use the turns to false  however if we read the stream piece by piece with read it retains the value,1
14864,ah yeah i missed that one  typo fixed ,0
16456,seems to me that we have at least in  places    can we refactor to a method     thanks,0
15489,this title should have the same grade of importance as,0
15489,livedox must have his own subtitle,1
15489,probably should have his own index or something,0
16562,minor thing  but since you added the new attribute to the end of both the  definition and this methods   id propose to sort the parameters like this  ,1
16565,yeah  there is a local set class for the redis set command  so if i want it  to have the right return type  i need immutable,0
14510,is this valuable output  i can see how it would be useful if there are problems  but its noisy for normal usage,1
14510,i was just following the riak way  but yeah im not the biggest fan of it either   i can remove it,0
13703,bah  yes  you are right this is why one shouldnt write code in githubs editor    in fact  the patch isnt even consistent in that it documents three values for the log kwarg  yet only implements only one i was originally thinking of allowing the user t,0
16649,the curly brace in our scala code is usually at the end of the previous line maybe the code could be formatted better    i had to read the documentation of to be sure,1
16729,thanks for describing the usecase kennethkoontz    the current way the meteor auth system is set up is that once you auth against an oauth provider your token is stored on the user document  as   for example    my underst,0
16565,just return a here ,1
16711,you copied this pattern around  times any chance you could extract it into a method ,1
16758,we should cap it with,1
16743,this should probably be   then you can use to get the key name and the string value to against,1
15394, is considered a language construct not a control structure so i think were ok there to treat it as a function  as that is how it is being used in this form,1
15394,in places where there is no clear standard that weve adopted  we should leave the code alone  when it comes down to it  someone else is maintaining that piece of code the component lead  and its   better to let them dictate the smaller aspects of ,1
16597,switching to  is good thing in this case but this    and this  ,0
16715,either way  i removed the unloading bit not having it doesnt seem to affect any of our existing tests,1
16499,oh ok  that makes sense,0
16729,ah  now i understand yes  your point makes sense lets keep it in for now    thanks for taking the time to help me understand the concern,0
16638,if you do not have vmware installed  install vmware player free,1
16813,can you add a bit about why someone would use this rather than the one that actually takes class ,1
16743, means the timestamp field in of the event  i think this may be better written as though perhaps as long as this special case is documented as such its fine ,1
16592,probably should be a global constant of a classlevel method on ,1
16824,this should be enclosed in if since you are allowing null and it will override the default name,1
11557,i understand that they work fine  was suggesting that both be the same for consistency guess we cant take out of api call anyways since web uses that now,0
11557,gotcha  just checking,0
16592,ah  is this the place where the question about one from once class overwriting an from another class came from     thats right youll get kitchen goes into the kitchen here  this way     instead maybe you want something m,1
13774,i didnt really have any use for adding the payload to the hooks arguments  but thats a good idea    i dont want to handle only nonmatched message types in this  thoughi want to allow custom handling of  any  message type,0
11557,i think that feeds and replies update should be single api call and return them both based on timestamp,1
11557,the thinking here was that there could be tons of replies for a post that the user doesnt necessarily care about  bogging down the original response of posts  its also more complicated on the backend side as there could be a recent reply to a post that ,1
16123,this was the only instance that is not preformatting and validating the orderid i added a test case,1
16123,ouch  my bad on this one i reverted this back to the original implementation,0
16597,you dont have to change it  but in is good practice to use this   it will prevent this kind of bugs  it will save you a lot of time debugging ,0
16123,agreed  i moved it to be part of the options hash tests are added accordingly,0
16123,i think its opinionated to embed the in the authorization  especially when the is already part of the request do you know why it was embedded here in the first place ,1
16123,i added a documentation snippet from the official xml spec,1
16806,sorry   just figured out that for some reason pip got turned off in my ide now i can see what you mean  ill fix it right away   ,0
15394,ive removed it however notice how its under control structures ,0
16889,supernit space after   i generally do a space after  as well for anonymous functions  but i also try not to use anonymous functions id actually probably rewrite this as,1
16597,i understand the bug youre referring to and what creates the difference between the comparison and the assignment     id prefer to have the variable on the left side of the comparaison and the value being compared to on the right side as i think this mak,0
16889,not sure this should throw that means nothing would get returned to the callback  right  i feel like with callbackstyle functions  theres an implied contract with the consumer that the callback   should always be called  and that errors will be sent to t,1
16938,im not sure because they are very specific on what we are going to test ive added more tests to test warnings and errors,1
16887,hmm does this add extra args you dont want or something to     seems like you could pass it directly and avoid the extra anon functions for each ,1
16945,good catch i think i rather dumb it down a bit to only accept str and let the py version be a  to much magic will only hurt,0
16831,update the comment  are handled,0
8268,well yes  and so was  before that  but in fact in some cases it seemed direct declaration of dependency was required in the past   some cases a compile scope dependency was depending on junit   version x and that was overriding ,0
16953,it is  at the moment  because i was restricting everything to r to get  something working  im going back over the and to extend  them for rm  which is what we have already done with the gomatrix library    you are correct about the,1
8268,i think if we are going to spend the effort to update the deps  we should spend the effort to minimize there declarations as well,1
8415,i like adapter and we already have with quick search,0
16968,the padding should be set to to ensure that it causes no regressions,1
14575,do you want to try moving the unicode character to the end so its the last thing before the newline ,1
16945,i agree about magic ,0
14637,youll get used to it ,0
16968,we may want to call when setting the shadow layer as well,1
14575,wow   that seemed to trigger it,0
8415,this is a  so yes is the right name the spca is the adapter  delegating to a source    the is different its an active component not polled that extends so it has the,0
16968,what happens when the user sets only one of shadow color or shadow offset   should we have some default values for these  if both are needed  we should only call when both are present,1
16968,similar to the comment above  what happens when you call when  for some of these fields ,0
17022,please also pull to remove the now redundant check,1
16761,i think this method should be in the test class  not in the provider class,1
10934,are we still using  somewhere ,1
16806,the is also needed in the basic use case simple  one alpha fit with elasticnet  it cant be stored in then,1
16973,if youre deregistering a range of codes  it calls once per code  unlike during registration  where it updates the dict once per code  but calls just once for the range,1
16973,good catch this is probably spammy and raceprone,0
16973,yes  maybe it should be changed to have a  function,0
16806,    because the prototype told me so the prototype is gold standard      also for the other tests    what do you mean by the prototype ,1
15995,i think it makes more sense to access the controller from the dialog code  context menus do it that way,1
17003,empty lines could be removed nitpick  lol p,1
17003,usually  var statements with multiple lines are indented once more to the right imo better readability  but your call  that is an opinion  and a nitpick ,1
16983,maybe you could copy over the docstring examples from numpy here  so they get tested,1
17084,achtung  the default encoding is localedependent  not always utf this wont do what you expect on windows  in cron jobs  and so on    this is one thing where i think they really screwed up with python   but its been discussed before and apparently i,1
13489,what about making this a  or  event so that we know the video is playing ,1
17084,but   as a global variable set as     so do we want to force everything as utf   and use  everywhere  ,1
16781,i think this line is too long,1
17084,we could use  i dont think theres any reason to save html in anything other than utf  though,1
16806, makes only sense if the list is sorted at some time  i dont think thats needed for coordinate descent    yes but thats a reasonable choice to keep the set ordered so when you  loop over features on only just positively in memory in other words  it avoi,1
16806, the is also needed in the basic use case simple  one alpha fit with elasticnet   why  i dont understand all we need is to learn the coefficients    same feeling here    if you do,1
16726,oops heh leftover fragment from debugging ill fix that right up,0
13489,i already test for autoplay and loop working  so this just tests that they are set when they would be read  this is fine,1
17212,do you need to specify  here or is that the default ,1
11821,ill fix it when merging,0
16511,i should specify i believe defining numpy arrays as a  function argument  leads to fast indexing  but defining arrays as variables does not,1
6728,ok  maybe just a comment to the effect that the arbitrary selection of transitions is intended to be representative but not exhaustive  might help a maintainer if a refactoring later breaks something   either covered or not covered by the test,0
6682,i agree with this concept  but i think we need a more descriptive fact name here,0
17234,instead of using h  perhaps we should use constants  imho that would make the code more legible,1
16575,i should probably add measures to if we want them to be useful right now its very difficult to index into the measures array to find the values for a specific part,1
17229,i think  is better indeed   is good too,0
16429,i think we should use of a sekizai tag here to provide the css resources so that the style is available in any cms page,1
6711,ideally this would go in a  since its needed for every test,0
17239,yes  i forgot to remove manageorgs,0
6779,ginko this code looks like it could be cleaned up quite a lot  just declare all these variables first as blank strings  then in your if blocks just set the variables that is are different under that   condition    you could also change the ,1
6771,also  the intent was to leave these boxes and configs publicly available  and it seems the community standard is to have both puppet and chef available,1
17245,paddy  could you please leave the old tests in there as well  that way we ensure there are no bc issues or at least become aware were there any,1
17245,sorry for repeating myself  could you please leave the old tests in there as well  that way we ensure there are no bc issues or at least become aware were there any,1
17234,because we have only three options here and because i used the standard values of many shell commands  i think its not a good idea generally speaking you are right but in this case i think is not so   necessary,1
17234,its only a quick way to obtain the same result here,1
17247,circles dont have vertices   but actually is this even used anywhere  it looks like  just calls ,1
17249,please remove the null check should be consistent regardless of prefix,1
17240,i remember that too i must have rebased it in when i wasnt paying attention anyway  its fixed now i deleting code ,0
17234,yes  thats true,0
17240,im always open for review i wouldnt have opened a pr if i hadnt put on my asbestos underpants    i was rewriting the summary  and now im not sure if this does the right thing currently  it updates the workdir to match whats in the index  but maybe t,0
17247,there are just  points here  so the square isnt being closed if you add  as the last element in the path  it will autoclose the shape and make the starting ending vertex look better than if you just   repeated the first coordinate,1
17241,i would rather say the optimal   subtree   ,1
17248,can you add a link to the documentation      you can write multine comments with,1
17234,the code is not so clear here  you are right i reused the output as a new variable i will change this,1
17240,good catch done ,0
17228,i think andreas is taking a hardline about uses of  even though i think this is pretty harmless  you have a getter  so its probably somewhat annoying to change  but i have discharged my duty in   warning you about it,1
6857,yeah  i also thought about that in my opinion we shouldnt override and  say somebody customized these files in  and upgrades to   all his changes are lost i think its a bad idea you said yourself  that the se works as a s,0
17254,kinda hacky  i know ,0
17247,yeah  this is used in the dataensure on l to make sure the inner shape is totally enclosed by the outer shape there are some weird corner cases literally d,0
17255,this could become an attribute of the app thats make it more yuilike,1
17251,i dont mind  i am okay with that    while i am at it  i must warn you  though  i am currently making  huge  changes on the tree structure see  i dont know how we should resolve our future conflicts   ,0
16575,im responsible for this  sorry,0
6725,i believe we can actually change the  to be  to cut down on the typing and not need to define the  its one of the things i really like about faraday,1
6725,we are using the  middleware  so well get an exception if things dont work,1
17249,the reason the null check is here is so that it will make if the doc is null not sure what the desired behavior would be in this situation if i remove the null check but  still contains the id    in a sense the ,1
6725,you should just be able to pass the  hash directly in as the second argument to  without needing to convert it to a string were you having problems with that ,1
17255,might be useful to pass the  option so you get a instance back from this,1
17237,i am thinking of having a single histogram function without     does input validation literally in  lines and then  it calls i think we should put the code in one function  it made sense to separate ,1
17245,fixed in source  sorry  the comment can be deleted,0
17262,wrapped everything into a that seems to be the easier and more readable approach,1
7165,maybe the comment above is worded incorrectly  this method works fine  if you are using only a few segments in a  since you can calculate the number of samples by adding up all the times if there are going to be multiple  then you have to d,0
7043,wow  overlooked while copying from one file to another  fixed,0
17228,lol  that was actually more a todo item the code i have now is not your error handling code ,1
6878,indeed  i think the extra is a typo  sort of redundant  ill fix this in the docs,1
17237,sounds right i will move the text output code in the caller in     we can figure out later how exactly to output as text,0
6711,did that  thanks for the suggestion ,0
17268,the  shouldnt be hard coded in here since gutsy is open source and presumably someone one day besides may want to use it  we probably do this elsewhere  if so  we should maybe just fix all of   them in another pull request  otherwise ,1
17265,i remember trying to remove the if and it errored out somewhere,1
17268,you may want to use the parser thing in utils here,1
17265,schema is probably different since i did a lot of database stuff on other branches  and i was trying to figure out how to do everything,1
6947,how about adding something like,1
17283,yeah youre right  this shouldnt be top level  it fixes the test but the test is flawed since will never be a fact    ive reverted this commit,0
17286,could you do a quick check and see if there is actually a requirement for explicitly an   id love to move this logic to have it consume a generic  and the,1
17286,it should actually be possible with the compromise of losing access to the  stuff ,1
17285,maybe would make more sense than    add to the top of file      if becomes unless,1
17287,yeah  that is good feedback ,0
17286,are you sure that we need a wrapped hydrator  after all   should allow you to access the fields directly also for writes  also here  could you do a quick check and see if  and,1
7024,as long as youre doing this  might as well make it something like    this would make it backwards ,1
6878,Cool i dont think i even would have thought of this  but i like the idea,0
17290,well just a minor thing you might wanna rename this to and same on the method above,1
17286,that is mainly because  is an orm specific method,1
17286,since we should ideally move to  and eventually extend the features here with more specific optimized logic  thats why i suggested to use ,1
7241,how about nonce range vs full work ,1
17296,can you rename  to something less verbose  i think  is fine  as it is  that is finally concerned with what to do with the contents,1
17300,it would be nice to have specs for these changes  and not just in the rspec matchers ,1
17300,yeah  agreed but where besides rspec matcher specs ,0
17302,ah yes  totally right,0
17302,worth sending this to crew or techteam ,1
17303,dont we need to drop this ,1
18785,it would help performance in the server itself,1
18785,true  and i cant see any problems as such with it  im just saying ,0
18785,returns the simple name of a spell eg confringos simple name is fireball at least i think this is what evilmidget is trying to achieve ,1
18785,ah right this change is not needed then,0
18785,exactly my point its much neater and does exactly the same,0
18785,i might change what does it  and how the spell name is stored though  but yeah  it is  and tbh you should have noticed  especially given this is code that is tested to work  and something like that   would break it,0
18785,i prefer the neater approach of them instead putting the spells jar file inside the folder  as theyre truly writing plugins for this plugin  it doesnt really make senseor is as efficient for them to create   a bukkit plugin thats simply adding onto ,1
18785,if were going to have plugins for this plugin  they might as well be able to access everything,1
18785,i do this a lot  and am doing it  and i have had no problems so far,1
18785,if a user wants to create just a spell they use this method if they want to do more then they should be able to make a plugin that accesses everything,1
18798,the behavior that i initially had in mind was that the reverse mapping would just hold the first token to generate the id but it doesnt really matter whether the reverse mapping holds the first token or   most recent token that hashes to the id  in either,1
18803,even though i think weve come a long way from c  ill move the declaration to the top   also  good call on using ,0
18785,they actually can access everything  as spells are passed an instance of ,1
18785,they can access everything  but not in a practical way  itd have to be in the constructor,1
18785,okay  im going to change partly to for the sake of readability and obviousness  and im going to modify and bring into use the spell annotation for description and alternate namesalthough class   names will still be used if an alternate name is,0
18785,oops  that wasnt intended to be a tag oh well,0
18811,no problem  ill update them,0
18827,c   allows you to specify the underlying type so you should be able to make it unsigned that way,1
18827,it would also probably be better to use set,1
14540,completely optional  but you could reduce branching logic we need to test with this,1
14540,if you want to log anything  we should probably use a log instance,1
18798,hmm  and what if two words in the document map to the same id ,1
18860,yeah  but i only need to look things up that one way  so why expose the  actual hashmap     seamless improvements ,0
18868,i was wondering if i needed a  function that returned a results class instead of just having the fitted attributes as part of the model class  however  ld have a class with only a fit function and nothing   else  which didnt seem right  but  it mig,1
18873,i believe all the values are given names with the k prefix  for example ,1
18868,yeah i would return a results class from fit the model should at least have a fit and a predict method,0
18874,if we need this  then i think its a sign that we still need to override ,1
12392,if the pull request  for  gets given the go ahead  id be happy to convert this to be a new descriptorstyle gsobject  it looks very good  and great to have the new improved factors for hlr and   fwhm,1
18878,yes  a small point    mostly concerned with having an approachable api,1
12392,as has happened before  i have to confess to not feeling very qualified to comment on this tree stuff  having not coded up anything similar in the past myself,1
18879,i think this part of fix should be merged  this is no need to reinit bundle again  we just need to use the existing one,1
12392,great that you harmonized these  params to the pythonlayer style,0
18880,i think we still need this for some use cases i know i had some  or should it be an argument to   ,1
18880,oh sorry  i see that its moved above ,0
17992,do we use the start year of the project or the file   the file was created in   not sure where the  came from,1
17992,this line should probably be moved up by the other attribute definitions for ,1
17992,in this method you are inconsistent about where you are putting spaces after  and   i think we want something like    i know the code style things probaby seem nitpicky  but they make the code much easier to rea,1
18883,i really like how you have refactored this method ,0
18883,i have not used js exceptions before  but it probably makes sense to start doing so  does js have a notion of exception types we should could use ,1
18860,ahh the objc naming conventions,0
18884,in my installation  i had to change this to  instead of  this was for paginating  asis it kept generating the  folder in the root directory instead of in   as  just returned  ,1
18885,i see you have made this a class but in the main html template  it is still the toolbar id  is this right ,1
12392,is this replicating code in    if so  can we do without the former now ,1
18885,this type of if statement only needs to be on the base classes  i would just put the code in this block at the top level and get rid of the test  see  and  for an example  i know this is very weird,1
16953,youre right  ill change it    fyi i just made an unstable  in progress commit to the bic branch  i  refactored  rewrote  and added a higher level function to  submit with an upper and lower bound of k    it is rough  but i think this,0
12392,ah  i see  later you also build a lookup table for the x values  hence it becomes analytic in the sbprofile sense,0
18878,those things are moved over    resolved,0
12392,good point  this function isnt that much of a tall pole using the lookup table is the more common code path  but thats a good change to make nonetheless  ill do that,0
12392,this is equivalent to the chord stuff when obscuration  we still need chord and all the rest for when obscuration  this basically skips a bunch of multiplications by  and such so its faster if ,1
12392,its the same code as for  i didnt repeat the derivation here  since its the same thing  but your probably right that its better to include it here as well,1
12392,it is square  seems like the better thing to do  since this isnt a radial profile  so the square region is i think the more relevant thing to do  but youre right that the debugging statement which i   probably just copied from another profiles corresp,1
18889,this is exactly the same way that it worked in the old video grabber  but sure a comment never hurts,0
18889, is the user facing api while is really an internal method  so perhaps i should bring it into the m file,1
18890,i think yw should be in group optional  its not required,1
18894,note  this may be why you need to rebase  as we are deprecating the usage of nxutils,1
18894,ok  can you or someone give me a hint as to how to rebase properly   the pull request was branched off of the tag v,1
18895,on my box  i already had git in the path for my user  might have been set up by either chocolatey or msysgit im pretty sure this should be kosher,1
12392,this  suggests that a valid keyword parameter is   yet this is not listed as a  in the documentation  is this a case of outofdate dox ,1
18878,i think its cleaner now    resolved,0
18878,i think i was just being kneejerky  i cleaned it up a bit and moved it to session,1
18878,agreed  not sure where to hold onto it  so    resolved,0
18878,i think so  yeah  removed    resolved,0
12392,i know that at some point we had discussed making n and ud more descriptive  like and  was that only for the python  ,1
18803,yea  i completely agree   ,0
18888,the cast was already in the code  but in fact it is not necessary because xy is passed to the path initializer  which performs the cast  i can take it out,1
18860,been writing a lot of iphone code lately does it show  p,1
18860,huh was wondering about that figured it was legacy code of some type    i can imagine bad things happening with this setting say i wrote a quick plugin to double ender pearl damage  or make each use summon a dragon  or whatever shouldnt there be a c,1
18860,there should  but none of us have access to it therefore  we are stuck until a we do get the source or b a new border module is integrated into guest part b is my personal favourite  as it is a form   of administration,1
18890,as a rule  after weve released galsim in some official way then i would say to keep such things for backwards compatibility  but given that were still developing it  it makes sense to me to say that we   want everyone including developers and eventual us,1
18898,patch looks good curious where did this routine come from ,0
18899,it might be a good idea to also unregister the signal handler just before is called later in,1
18900,this will have a global effect on the tests and will need to be undone at the end of execution perhaps     ,1
18900,i think it would be better to rename this file to something like     additionally  it might be worth mentioning inside the file that this is only used in the  tests,1
18900,this line is fine  but i dont believe the  is necessary normally       would suffice,0
17992,at first i wanted to do as key  mode as value but it is not possible   if we want someday  multiple for one mode who knows    the only way i saw was list of    ,1
18860,i understand why youre using the class in fact  i switched to use it as well i switched for because it seemed a better fit  thats all,0
18860,theres a good reason for this if youll look at the zone class  youll see ive already rewritten it to handle coordinates in the order they were selected rather than highestfirst this doesnt break   backwardscompatibility at all  btw sorted coord,0
18860,all i did was move it down a bit since the code now handles null arrival points by placing you within the target port at a position calculated to correspond to your current position within the sending   port  the previous error message that was in the if b,1
17992,im thinking of this branch to change the highlight     for raw cell that dont need cell magics prefixes     you could match on a git diff patern  or else maybe even  that should be handeled correctly by normal modes     tex for example ,1
17992,it is usefull for raw cell  where you can start on   end  im not sure   ,1
18904,i see your point and tend to agree names are but sound and smoke ill change it ,0
18908,fabpot so the message keys are fine  the way vicb described it was exactly the idea,1
18908,fabpot any preference in this  the patch works fine without the   but i can add and implement  too,1
18911,i was thinking perhaps we need a grunt task for this,1
18912,might wanna add ,1
18903,my bad i did remove it from our local installation  by for some reason failed to commit it,0
18907,this pr is simply moving   existing   code about for now  for simplicity in this pr  its just about making the testing process reusable in rd party twig extensions  optimizations should go in a   separate pr,1
18899,this is a good pt but wont be necessary after i make the changes above,0
18918,i tend to use  for stuff like this will take any symbol with a  at the end and call that method on it and use the symbol for pretty error messages so good things like     etc are all possible,1
12392,yes  good catch  ill add that documentation,0
12392,yes  i added it here too now,0
12392,sorry  i started this file by copying the airy version and forgot to edit this description,0
18883,yes no notreally  i found this  but you basically cant catch only some type or exception  or you need to use a switch case each time and reraise them  in the other hand  you can throw any,0
12392,yes  the python layer has these names for  but we never changed the corresponding stuff in c    and i dont see a compelling reason to,0
12392,fine  i just couldnt remember what we decided  ,0
18885,yes  need the  to pass it as the selector for the constructor   class is added by js  changing id to for consistency    ,0
18885,hu ok  hum not sure i understand   just the if statement  or the methods called inside     because  might not exist exist on other subclasses,0
16806,you should use otherwise some time will be spent centering the data which is not necessary here,1
16806,besides the memory jump difference iterate on active features or reduced set should do the same amount of computation and it should at least for small data be almost equivalent right ,1
18919,lines should be wrapped to  cols please,1
18919,please do not use global variables  i dont like this solution at all,1
18919,again  no globals  dont care whatever else you do  please no globals,1
18921,the pool is only used  if a is present could you move the call to   i will merge your pull requests as soon as possible  thanks again for your contributions ,1
18924,tried changing method signature to  but got strict notice declaration of should be compatible with that of ,1
18875,you can pass a tag name into  which then behaves essentially like   but during parsing so its affected as well,1
18929,can you put a comment for the different arguments that take a magic number boolean value  eg      ,1
18929,oh  nice  you can have a timeout on a test  did not know that ,0
18929,is this method really useful ,1
18895,the problem is that mstest would not copy  into the  directory  so when tests that used would fail because the dll is not in the path    heres some documentation i found on the matter,1
18912,youre grabbing same element  times one for isset and the second for  you could try to simplify your logic by moving the outside of if scope and doing the isset out too that would also allow you to inline the control structu,1
18912,you can inline this semantical error it wont exceed  chars,1
18930,i think  would be a better than   but i wonder if we should simply throw an ,1
18930,this will throw an exception for the following    i think that  should behave like  in unix system,1
18931,i think you dont need t  type wild copy paste  ,1
18897,yes  i like your suggestions  please use these messages in all drivers  thanks ,0
18930,the reason why i used is to be consistent an is also thrown if for some reason a file could not be created line ,1
18895,well have to keep this in mind  we have not built a release that used a native dll up until now,1
18895,although  all the configurations are set to build x  i might be wrong,0
18933,are these changes part of dynamic configurations  if not  i can merge them separately i assume theyre for some idegenerated files,1
18930,the change to add the  was added after the  release  so we can fix it now without breaking anyone,1
18914,how would this work with serialized cached instances ,1
18934,no real reason im just trying to expand these shorthand rules into their longhand counterparts so i can detect similarities easier    for example,1
18914,i also have same question as hosiplan ,1
18895,keep me updated should you encounter any issue  please,1
18935,i agree plus this is hard to understand  to my opinion i mean  the multiple drivers thing,1
18931,if it works  its better to use though  it may not compile with scala  you need to test it  if the name constant is not available in scala   keep your code  but add a note so that we remember   to get back to this,1
18895,this will work if you stick on only delivering an x version of    well  looks like kgybels is already bumping up against that limitation on his repo so i guess well be changing over to amd,1
13932,sure we can do that and woud end up with  classes subclassing from one and it would be easy to do obviously  but i wanted to keep it to gather for now until this is the only concern  everything else is addressed and pushed and rebased with master so some,0
18931,ok  this also explains my above comment  ,0
18939,it would be nice if one could change rc params even after the initial import  but im not even sure any of the other backends support this,1
18926,how about the oid of the git object to remove notes from     deal however  please use the singular form only one note per git object per namespace is allowed,1
18940,do we want to put in a safeguard here from getting stuck in an infinite loop  is that a likely occurrence ,1
13932,given these else conditions are identical  i think you can significantly reduce the complexity by using,1
18940,a comment here would be nice i think this is using a bisection method to find an optimum solution  but it would be nice if i had some confidence that that was the case  ,1
13932,ditto  and the next one,1
18914,i agree with you guys    for sure this is not the best approach  but the current events system cant handle this without create a event manager per entity class  and we dont have a di to store shared instances    if you have a better solution are welcome ,0
18942,same as my above coment here,1
18942,this is quite the smell id like someone with a bit more knowledge on to weigh in here,1
18890,quite right   error fixed and pushed,0
18942,for cucumber tests  we want to test the happypath of our code these tests are better left to testing using rspec you should remove all the cucumber tests that look for errors and use rspec to test   those cases,1
18943,i need another pair of eyes on this when running threaded  the packobjects code segfaults quite regularly inside  when calling   more exact when trying to free  in  ,1
18874,but couldnt we just insert it in the namespace environment ,1
18942,if we are going to use a block and split it onto multiple lines  we use the  style    ,1
18896,this problem appears to be restricted to webkit  and may be a bug the spec says that rem is equal to the computed value of  on the root element  except for  on the root itself in which,1
18931,ooops sorry  my mistake,0
18896,just to clarify  this bug has to do with  computed  values in webkit the values output by sass were always correct and seem to be tospec  which is why tests didnt pick them up what happens is   that if ,0
18931,yes  good idea i didnt think to that,0
18946,no need to confirm callback existence as you ensure that on l,1
18946,no need for this check  it will always be true,1
18947,i hope the intent here is clear i think this is a kinda neat solution to the i need to update this json value problem    the easiest way i found was to say     since the incoming,1
18948,woops  forgot to send movements to other players,0
8111,see  i told you now  typos any other comment about this pull request ,0
32070,no worries zacc  reflecting back what i primarily trying to get at is that method is returning a  i felt that a didnt convey that an instantiated is what is being returned ,0
32074,i know it was there already but while youre at it,0
32074,ok i guess ill just do it after merging  rest is good thanks ,0
32075,uh rereading the code now  i think i understand it better ignore my comments it changes from a basestring to a list ,0
32079,lloyd   i  have grammar problems  ill update the comment,0
32083,cool ill change that up,0
32088,could you  please  replace tabs with  spaces here and everywhere else where they might be  id suggest adjusting your editors settings to use  spaces for indenting ruby files,1
32093,thanks  you are right,0
32094,lloyd   i  have grammar problems  ill update the comment,0
32102,i like the name change  is more granular and clear to me,0
32108,did you mean to leave this in  also   is useful here,1
32131,we still need to figure out how to avoid taking a strong opinion on what the user needs,1
32135,ive been reluctant to add apispecific tokens to scribe  this is falls out of the scope of the library,1
32136,looks like my less compiler does things a little bit different p,1
32138,cant we use the  protocol here to get these values  or maybe something in the  module,1
32137,sure  ill fix it and send another pull request im not up to snuff on older versions of python i didnt know  lacked support for named exceptions ,0
32139,please adjust coding style so it fits see the if just below  also i think using might make more sense,1
32142,we can avoid if we update the configure script to only sudo the command that installs global npm modules,1
32141,the  state is interesting when i was originally thinking about this problem  i was imagining more states  for example a  could put you in a  state  but then on the next character you would exit that   into one of three states ,1
32141,instead of exiting with a goto  i would be tempted to add a  state and have terminal cases such as this just go into that state and then let the loop exit naturally,1
32141,i was thinking of this too  but theres also the issue of operator chaining  im using the state machine to detect operators and dispatch the parsing operations  and  to parse the argument to the caret   it seems l,1
32141,yeah  that seems cleaner  made me feel a little dirty,0
32149,thanks  ill add the check,0
32149,you use here  however  if youll make changes inside as ive shown above this test will be redundant  ,1
32149,i agree i basically went off the original jira but i am more than happy to change this to something less obtrusive,0
32165,ahh good point  i would guess that a grep like that would be unreliable  i guess theres not much to be done here,0
32169,i guess we have to do some work to understand how our subfields overlap when it comes to photometry   when youre doing photometry  where does the error on the fluxes of each pixel come from     as i wrote it  this is meant to mirror how source extractor ,1
32148,i guess option  makes the most sense,0
32169,yeah i agree that  isnt the best but im worried that  might be confusing if we have an  class how about   on the downside   is a little too general  but on the upside it would mirror the  attribute of   the image cla,0
32148,so nice to be getting rid of this hardcoded stuff,0
32169,so  the equation in line  includes contributions  and  from reach et al  it doesnt include the first  which is the uncertainty in the background level this is because background   subtraction is not part of   and the ,1
32169,thanks  will fix,0
32148,  yeah  weve definitely got to use the existing fetch mechanism as the codename api,0
32169,definitely agree that each function should have a full docstring im waiting to do it until were sure we dont want to edit the docstring for  too much more because it is mostly a copypaste  as you   said,0
32169,ok  cool  just checking ,0
32148,i think most of them are references  i was working on a way to just have to supply the ones that are not in the pattern as a codename  in a lot of places  the is more convenient to use than the name   anyway  and this is a ver,1
32148,with something like this  we would not have to list out any  only the exceptions to the pattern,1
32148,please be more specific  you want to put them on a different class  thats just moving them  you dont like the method names  or the way it uses the class attributes     ,1
32148,that seems like an api win since that is the most common case  would make it simpler and faster maybe too,1
32148,this is used by the tasks thing  so i think it will be a leftover and get deleted  took this out too  it is referenced in a tasks method  obviously we dont have any tests related to this nothing new   failed with it gone  and we want to remove that ,1
32195,and really  if this isnt a good test  thats fine i was also trying to test the clearing of redis did something if you ramp this up from   then more than this test would fail if you didnt clear redis so   whatever you think is best,1
32148,we would have to test  but you may be right  i may have added it when something else was broken  or it may actually be necessary,1
32148,but it needs a test if we want to keep it and use it,1
32148,you mean i did this   sorry  im sure i never meant this as a final solution,0
32148,was only referenced in a couple of specs  got rid of that and i think this is good now  ,0
32222,as i understand this was copy paste  in the jpa adapter wont be applied on the polling task proxy it is direct adapter ability,0
32148,might have been a dumb comment  seemed like it wasnt necessarily user specific code  i think i need to catch up a bit,1
32224,ditto this with parentheses,0
32148,i agree  and i keep getting myself confused about the final api on this stuff    yes  lets address this by getting rid of the old stuff at the right point in the process,0
32222,thanks artem  we can actually remove this element as the transactions will be handled by the poller in case of an inbound adapter,0
32131,agreed  although the user doesnt have to use for sure we should check to see if is defined  otherwise this will blowup apart from that  what if we offer a localization feature  where home    and action,0
32236,as this enum is public  it might make sense to give it a more c friendly name    how  do you feel about       ,1
32222,we do rely on the sub element of the  element for inbound channel adapter and we proxy the class if we have the  sub element to the outbound channel adapter gateway    the,1
32222,yes  amol  i understand  im about this javadoc its not reflect the reality of resulted  however  i think this code will be moved somewhere up  when mark will give agree to implement ,0
32148,this was  i think  we may want to move parts of this to session or whatever that becomes,1
32236,sorry  i overlooked this could you move this type to the main  namespace ,0
32148,session will be problematic unless it will play well with the existing session model class that is more or less implicit  and i agree with   and that it needs a better home,1
32222,markfisher what should be the best way to refactor this  should we create a common util class under where we store common xml config parsing utility methods  ,1
32169,yes  i was suggesting by default  which would mean that poisson noise could be ignored which it can at long wavelengths,1
32148,i dont think this has to be hardcoded  but it was convenient a few times in debugging  in any case  it shouldnt need to be hardcoded,1
32148,re the stamper attribute explicit in the version create  i think i may have had trouble getting the equivalent of this to work right for revisions  or maybe i hadnt done it right yet,1
28029,i dont see how this will harm anything,1
32148,that may be debatable  but i changed this case back  i did notice the same pattern two other places  and i wonder if you find it the same there,1
32268,out of curiosity  why these  lines are enclosed with     is there something special about this syntax im not aware of ,1
32268,nothing special  i think there may have been an else on line ,1
32148,i think maybe the whole file can be removed  or at least thats the goal,1
32148,im thinking that the order of these is important in thinking about which parts to add first  next   ,1
32290,yes  it should be within check ,0
32299,i adjusted the start date  but i dont think this reduces the time it takes to build at least it doesnt with some fairly simple timings looking over the vbench code  it looks like the repo is rebuilt into a   clean directory for each commit i could be ,1
32148,i added a new codname method that looks it up in codenames,1
32305,this shouldnt be here,1
32305,a bit of an explanation as to what this does would be helpful,1
32305,when the server has a lot of ip addresses and i want to do proxy throught special ip  listen on that ip didnt help  server will connect throught default ip  this patch fix it  ,1
32148,i think this test can be if codename  but we need tests for it  then,1
32305,right  i get that i mean in the file itself  such that others viewing the example later can make sense of it that  and id collapse the proxy examples  no need for two  just document this option,0
32313,this factory object is what im currently using to put together a sequence of worlds to be played in order  along with their descriptions it would probably be much better as some sort of dsl  or even a   json file  ,1
32148,i attempted to get rid of this  but there are clearly dependencies  what i intended for this is that it would be automatic  generated if necessary when you assemble all your packs with the core and   deploy,1
32313,similar to   this code could probably benefit from a nice dsl but in the code below you will be able to see how my generalized world objects are meant to be used the  reflects the layout of the world   used in practic,0
32313,this is about as simple of an object as you can imagine  but its mostly because i didnt really add any abstraction at all it probably can be the home of more interesting level specific logic later,1
32313,because there  is  a possibility for floating point precision errors  i do rejection sampling and generate a new point if it is not in the distance range this is messy business  and is possibly a sign of a   bad model the problem is that the borders betwe,1
32148,this method needs to be used in a few more places  or the underlying  which iterates through the set members resetting the patterns on each one,1
32313,before the points we chose were truncated to integers  now that they arent we need to prevent displaying giant unformatted floats but i sort of hate doing formatting code in data structures  perhaps   this belongs elsewhere ,1
32313,this is a clever tagging trick which facilitates easy lookup of points via the  object that  wraps its points in its a bit of a kludge but works surprisingly well,1
32313,total hack this is a sign i am trying too hard  i should instead be creating an enumerator here  or storing and incrementing an index,1
32313,this is definitely a sign of an object that needs to be extracted whenever you have a method that says lets delete all the variables and reinitialize them  you are essentially recreating object   creation destruction mechanisms still  i struggled to f,0
32313,i was really happy to get this logic out of the ui code  although  is an incredibly vague method name,0
32318,what about something like  i feels cleaner  wdyt      ,1
32313,needed to remove this because the presenter needs to present messages throughout the game  not just at the end,1
32313,determining whether the game is finished now relies on a boolean field  which is actually a bit cleaner than checking for the presence of a display message,1
32313,while it was a bit tedious to set this up  it makes it possible for us to both run the game as an executable script  and also control it grammatically from  testing tool,1
32313,if we had used a hash  this would look like    ,1
32313,if we had used a hash  this would look like    ,1
32148,stuff comes last  right ,0
32313,adding these acceptance tests was a mixed blessing on the one hand  it is a very rigorous test because it verifies the ability to play through an entire game using the same inputs as a player would   enter on the other hand  it is extremely fragile code a,1
32331,ideally this should be    rails generate ,1
32148,we can autoinstantiate all of these things without having a file  i want to try to avoid writing local files whereever possible so that were compatible with readonly systems like heroku,1
32339,can you remove this  i assume it was for debugging during development ,1
32148,this should be done in a rule set  right ,1
32342,use like  ,1
32342,future note  consider adding an option for splitting up all data sent by a would be an excellent way to make sure that this always works for every request we make from the test suite,1
32331,indeed ive made the correction,1
32148,note that this is updated  i did manage to update the commit range  and it shows the new diffs  maybe i should target the pull request to agil  though  not develop,1
32342,the data is transparently sent as multiple packets by tcp  but theyre reassembled into a stream when theyre received so this interaction between the two layers isnt usually seen by the receiver unless   its on a slow link with high packet loss and or hi,1
32342,i agree we need specific tests for this  i dont agree that this has to be in the client for unusual behaviors  raw is what should be used  you already know im not a fan of adding dozens of nonsensical   options to my code  ,0
32318,sounds good to me  ,0
32148,the above change where becomes   but it must be right  seems like an odd move  but i think i remember now,1
32364,i dont think this should be a link  semantically this isnt linking to  another page,1
32361,only someone who knows about genetics would see this,1
32364,hmm  true i needed a id to point at from the attribute maybe its better to change back to class and loop through all on the page and give them a unique id  like,0
32310,agreed that was mostly a copy paste from the original code  i just made some changes to exploit some existing magit faces,0
32148,right  but it has to happen by the point we load this file now,0
32229,because if for any reason it fails dir is locked by some process or whatever  i dont think we should bug the user its really not such a big deal  just an empty dir left over on windows its quite easy   to have filesystem locks since the os handles th,1
32379,this line should not be used sorry,1
32148,right  as we have discussed before  thanks for the reminder,0
32386,maybe this should be separated for linux and use  to find yaml ,1
32386,i think that ruby build scripts will just use  anyway  if you set  but i could be wrong    the thing is  its really hard to detect whether libyaml is properly installed to be sure  you need to compile and link a program aga,1
32393,sorry  i cleaned the imports when refactoring the solution for url if you want i can add them again  but i dont think it worths it,0
32395,we should be sending back a valid json string   is invalid json because invalid assertion  is being stuck on the front of it in line  the string concatenation should happen in   and   should   remain the raw re,1
32403,changed to no since it should only be testing stylistic i guess  feel free to change it back,1
32398,oh  i didnt know,0
32406,can we make the new class row templates include a common template to reduce code duplication ,1
32376,i see what you mean  just add write methods to the progress writer not  that clean but less classes i guess  ,1
32386,skaes maybe we could just wrap the old code in       ,1
32412,should the migration copy the internal names over to the display names or pass them through a reasonable mapping ,1
32376,i prefer an explicit call ctors should really only be used to initializing data its like  or   the progress writer can be started and stopped i can add  but ill leave it as star,1
32418,the released version fails  the problem has been fixed in master but the gem has not been released yet  ill change this as soon as omniauth is released again,1
32410,this is in   id remove it from the commit  if you want to keep it  id rename connect to so that other providers can make use of this file as well,1
32421,i think its the caller who should decide how something gets executed id remove the future  and the,1
32421,id probably remove all these methods and added a way to register async callbacks to the transitions,1
32431,certainly seems fine to me,0
32421,this was in place to get timeout behavior on the call  which i was thinking was necessary when sticking to nygards version of the circuit breaker  so if the call exceeds the call timeout that is   specified  that can be considered a failure      i can ce,1
32421,the timeout can be considered after the call returns it will not fail fast of current call  but the failure counter is increased  using future with await here is not an option  since it will consume additional thread resource,1
32421,sure thing  patrik  the durable mailbox implementations would then be responsible for their own timeout handling  which im understanding viktors point to be as well caller who should decide    thanks for the feedback ,0
32421,if theres a good place to look for examples here  that would be helpful to me  im thinking youre looking for a signature along the lines of    ,1
32421,definitely  thanks     i also need to make them config options  will need to dig a little deeper in that to see the best way so that the durable queue subclasses are kept dry,0
32421,i think you should have a separate perhaps extends,1
32421,ouch  thats embarassing  will do,0
32435,i think my editor broke the makefile  but this is the key line,1
32450,i agree with you that this is somewhat inefficient  also creating new elements on every frame is not so good for gc  one way we could avoid this calculation of the camera transform is with lazy evaluation not sure how to achieve this yet  but seems ,0
32410,sorry  i didnt notice this was included  wasnt supposed to be part of the commit given the will modify to have it service specific and will add a brief howto on how to use this d,0
32456,what if we want to have an offset for the destination ,1
32456,hmm  now we have two versions of each process and array method  lets document why we need both  and when to use which,1
32342,because were only testing  or  parts of the code and therefore only  or  tests should be needed if you want to make sure it works over many values you can just change the values  and  to   something more random or repeat it with a range of values ,1
32131,yeah that would be a good idea     about the strong opinion  maybe we could check if the controller responds to  or some method like that and call this code otherwise  it would allow easy overriding but let the behavior by default it w,0
32504,yes  worth trying to comment this out to see if we can still run it,0
32504,yes  good to move this in line,0
32504,yay  no more saving addresses twice in memory ,0
32169,just so were clear   is part of the astropy core  now  which means its a dependency of this package  has  in it  so i dont think it affects the modularity     but your point about it being more n,1
32510,the reason is that nonnegative integers include  and  is odd  so we cannot conclude that  is even,1
32491,please fix the cs here,1
32533,this solution  with a separate transition  certainly works is there a reason  though  not to simply enable the search button  every  time the appear event is fired ie  including the first time   ,1
32536,great  hint hint as in its current form it would break people who install it from here    thanks ,0
32482,because that would be obvious and make total sense   i guess i just needed a second pair of eyes  i was staring at the code last night thinking that something was not quite right,1
32576,theres already a default set in aliasmanager for the name   is this just a redo ,1
32576,seems these alias names should be defined in the aliasmanager setup not via startup calls  otherwise i cant rely on dpwebapi existing unless this component is enabled ,1
32576,great  missed that you had done that ill update the webapi component as well     mike,0
32355,mostly resolved now  some additional bugs fixed,1
32589,sorry  but i am removing this line for now  as its under discussion and we dont confuse the user with another choice that is a duplicate of an existing choice if you feel strongly about this  please take   it up with markp  its ultimately his call,0
32585,yes  that makes me think i need to add a credit section,0
32365,you are right about this one your approach before was much better,0
32585,quentin  can we go from an api point of view  what do we want to expose       can we make those the only tasks available  ,1
32365,you mean using this     basically  reverting  ,1
32589,i can live without it  but you might be asked for this again in future if a customer asks for a simplified offline install mechanism ie  w o having to unpack the larger zip     can you let me know when the new update sites are available  eg  ,1
32585,basically it is to enhance the irb shell capabilities,1
32608,a  is indeed built from a   but i wouldnt say it   is   a  how about only exposing the oid of the  ,1
32612,needs a comment indicating what the patch is forthis allows future maintainers to make informed decisions about whether to pull the patch or leave it in,1
32490,this is meant to test a module on its own  not in the context of a zf application,1
32365,most probably you need to use please check man  ebuild for that,1
32629,its probably not a good idea to have the  variable switching from referencing a dom element to a string better to cache the id in a new variable,1
32632,could you change that to a case statement please ,1
32629,this needs a bit of work  itd benefit from being dried out a bit  since creating audio and video elements is a very similar process also needs to have checks for undefined values,1
32088,the style used in the rest of this codebase for multiline blocks is to use  instead of curly braces,1
32629,can you give the audio video elements an id  save it to  and use  instead of ,1
32629,same as above  use  here,1
32608,and override the equality operators like you did in gitobject     you can directly use the   but youll have to define what uniquely identifies a note from another one,1
32342,bfrog thats actually a good idea i believe the reasoning here is that we already done the work to set up a set of expected requestresponse values in the test suite no need to duplicate anything if   all we want to do is to mess with the arrival rate of,0
32647,i considered this  that would make us repeat the console  undefined condition in each line,1
32647,i can use the same code in initializing the module instead of having to repeat it here,1
32647,what about the next guy who comes along and is messing with tests and has to rediscover it  i think its worth having the decisions about the code and its tests and building written in place,1
32647,does your implementation of require in the browser use the identical implementation as node ,1
32647,doing a delete on should return a   as  shouldnt exist    itay,1
32608,the oid is the identifier of the blob containing the text of the note try to  it,1
32647,originally it was i switched to in analogy with for arrays,1
32608,should the target of the note taken into account as well   should the same textual content created at a different moment pointing at a different object be considered the same note or not ,1
32608,hey  you stole my questions smile     should the target of the note taken into account as well     the problem is that there is currently no way in that im awere of which can give us the target of the note nothing comparable to,1
32667,same as above these are useless here and will just give us errors,0
32671,for caches we do not pull specific branches every cache is intended to have all available changesets,1
32680,please do not reformat sources without making a semantic change,1
32684,hmm  i wonder if you dont just want to return the query and let the caller fetch the results and turn them into a list  again im really really worried about the memory consumption of loading a bunch   of measurements into memory all at once also  a calle,1
32684,heres a case where you could iterate over results from the query returned by renamed to and serialize them one by one we would eventually change this code to construct the archive zip files on   the fly rat,1
32684,would be nice to factor this out into its own method allowing you to write a unit test for it  ,1
32682,good question dont have a good answer to that it seemed arbitrarily large enough to me but apparently not,0
32682,did you check for deserialization compatibility  ie run the old plugin  then update and browse this action using the new plugin  i think it will be ok just set to null by xstream but ought to check it,1
32682,do you want to include this in   not necessary  of course  but might be desirable,1
32682,might suggest a different method name  like   to make it clear that this is an analogue of  which is admittedly a bit of a misnomer currently,1
32684,you can use    with a single item not a tuple to deal with the line length issue also  please do not editorialize in comments  ,1
32684,more useful to include the full error text and a more descriptive error message to help with debugging  ,1
32682,ill make this   to capture one or more digits,0
32684,to be consistent with the rest of this app  please use a jsonencoded response  eg    ,0
32682,sure  ill add it as which mimics the default changeset format of hg log,0
32682,sounds good fortunately i think this pattern does not need to not match node ids  which on rare occasions will happen to consist of all decimal digits,0
32684,typo measurement you have this typo in several places  including the comments  please scour the source for this  ,1
32694,i think it will be better to have this sort of documentation in the wiki  what do you think ,1
32694,whops  sorry the refactor is necessary  but i mean  those lines        these seem to be,0
32694,sure i just removed this  theyre done,0
32694,just added to the wiki  ,1
32297,that part is now done,0
32699,does python not have   im using in a different script  but its not used in or ,1
32699,convention is that variables starting with an underscore are private obviously nothing enforces that and note also the existence of properties,1
32703,you could probably skip the or     should suffice,0
32699,i copied this from the above method which you wrote what would  do differently  ,1
32713,this list should be alphabetized  if you can put your name in the right place ill go ahead an merge it in,1
32718,do we have to bring this in globally  as part of loading the root puppet module ,1
32718,unless this is used in more than one terminus implementation  we can squash it down into the actual hiera endpoint  we might as well do that  the code reuse through inheritance approach is not   awesome    assuming that there isnt some codified metapr,1
32718,so  the stubby tests are ok  but it would be great to have some tests that only run if hiera is installed  and that actually  do  the lookup  otherwise if the hiera interface changes we will totally keep   passing,1
32673,i checked some places and k doesnt do anything with these flags so its not a bad thing  they just get synced now its good for when we would add support for them,1
32729,always use shell paths instead of hardcoded windows paths because windows likes to virtualize these directories and virtualization is used for program files in the cloud in this case  use ,1
32732,will this work in a nonexecutable part of the script  is it needed as it is already in  ,1
32734,having a ten second timeout for running the two local tests was pretty useful,1
32732,does this work on the production server as well as on the developers machine  lets try a test script on the production machine before we change anything else,1
32732,lets change the name of the file to something that does not identify me perhaps ,1
32738,i wonder if less has some magic for sprites builtin  thinkingoutloud,1
32732,maybe change  to,1
32734,i didnt think about the use of   i made it match the example in the readme youre right that the local test made perfect sense to have a short timeout,1
32732,please add the hit counter changes to your description thanx,1
32732,maybe this should be also ,1
32732,this is my workhorse we should try a production test before deploying it,1
32741,is there anything in here thats not covered by the install instructions in the readme ,1
32741,this is a problem on all the queuey calls so i filed  to take care of it everywhere,1
32732,i might change this one in advance of changes made in this change what happens if i do ,1
32734,okay  nevermind then  ill land the commit and update it i happen to have apache running on port  and no php on nginx  but as a reference for others  that shouldnt be there  while the short   timeout is still useful,0
32729,done  thanks for the review feedback,0
32741,thanks  i added this in in the future  can you make your commit messages more descriptive so i can pull them while keeping a clean history ,0
32741,right  the client would need to look up the site keyed by the queue url if thats important should the site be a part of the encryption key ,0
32748,it looks like  is a mutable object you cant use mutable objects as dictionary keys,1
32750,this double check to feels like its breaking the abstraction layer of i suggest more    ,1
32748,you might consider replacing line  and lines  with  ,1
32748,nevermind  youre using   which is a static string i blame the long day,1
32750,same comment as above,0
32748,now that i see what you are doing  you definitely want     ,0
32757,sorry to be picky  could you please fix spelling in this comment exist is misspelled exsist and add a space after a   thx,1
32756,please add some constant declarations so its easier to decipher the params in the get invoc,1
32756,please make trip a symbol,1
32756,i think we could just edit the params hash in place theres a delete method on hashes that may be of use  this should only be  lines of code i think,1
32732,is there a reason why it might not work  it can certainly be tested on a production server before deploying,1
32226,as i think i said in the original ajax pr  each line should have its own var i do see that you copy pasted this from elsewhere,1
32732,yes is that ok ,0
32732,yes  good catch,0
32767,are you absolutely sure about this ,0
32732,go ahead its not a big deal,0
32767,if you have any time to fix it  go ahead i just wanted to get as close to working as possible because no one reported that these bugs still existed until i found them tonight,1
32732,would it make sense to remove this file from source control ,1
32732,right the hit counter wasnt working  so i fixed it the database connection change was done to eliminate repeated code,0
32732,are you sure it should be written to   i never saw any html files written there should we just remove this script from source control  and you can keep a copy of it in case you need it later ,1
32732,can we remove it from source control  you can keep an archive of it locally,1
32573,i added documentation for these functions,1
32732,i would move them inside of,1
32226,massive  to that it is harder to read and uses considerably more resources    there was an interesting talk in an irc channel ages ago ill see if  i can find it later  where it was described as being almost like the  following,1
32732,i have experienced some differences between the production server perl and the development environment perl setting up a test script and testing it would be good,1
32774,this causes warnings  fixed,0
32732,wouldnt a message be better than none ,1
32606,they are from the disassembly of emi would just adding a comment saying that suffice  the numbers seem to pretty much be magic to me,1
32732,would security be sufficient without them  are there other ways to be more secure ,1
32773,i thought we didnt need the  at the end of these  no ,1
32775,i just figured for every  ignores  we give them the option to turn it off id be happy to just give the option at  instead ,1
32775,probably should make this a constant looks like a magic number to me   ,1
32778,please fix this  thanks,0
32732,no this is the sourcepage and i was wrong  it belongs in subdomains prepage should be in  so what you did was write and it is in the right place lets keep it just in case,1
32732,good  if it can  easily be handled  please do  and add it to the description of changes thanks also that takes care of my concern above about  and   they can go along with the sseccurrittyy folder,0
32775,when does this happen  should we do something here ,1
32781,all functions defined by twig are prefixed by twig to avoid conflicts please do it here too and twig may be better here as it is only an internal function  to be consistent with twig itself,1
32782,that sounds good ill remove this function,0
32761,sorry if it is really stupid question  but what are package tasks i could not find anything at area nor wiki and if it should be done in a develop script  which one     when creating this fix  i just thought of the best place to insert it in  and i ,1

32781,ok i change this,0
32789,agreed  this part needs to be fixed,0
32606,for me its just fine  minor magic numbers,0
32807,is this correct  should it be true ,1
32807,you have used  in a few laces you should add a constant somewhere  same for above,1
32684,just checking these off as i go  done,1
32811,seems like a bug fix  should be a separate commit,1
32801,totally agree  ill change that around and include that as part of the pull request that takes phils feedback into account  thanks ,0
32206,lol  i understand that  do you by chance have experience with jabber libs in other languages   i may just look for a good python one or something   looks nice  ,0
32839,since the views are already separate classes  can we move the defaults into those classes as well ,1
32839,im seeing this pattern a lot in these views  can  get refactored to eliminate this duplication ,1
32839,this switched from  to  is that right     update i see this changed everywhere  so this is correct,0

32839,we should test that latest also works for a fallback  but possibly not here,1
32839,i see what this is doing forcing a full clean so that we get the queryset  but it should be calling  so that its not so tricky,1
32684,typo fixed and added a  for the unit test you can reassign this later    i thing the this method is a closer fit to the other conversion methods in  as things are right now  the only things in are the actual model clas,0
32684,added a  for the unit test either i will get to some of these next week  or you can reassign this later,1
32684,i agree  but this will bring other changes  marked as a todo,0
32684,this should happen with a change to since we are using that for part of the serialization  that was the code that came from you mentioned wanting to improve this  i think that if we can change   helpe,1
32673,okay  here  this is true nothing wrong with saving draft or recent in the db but below  in  trying to set recent will give unpredictable results and should fail  as that flag should only be changeable   by the server  so it should be e,0
32853,i might have to release it  or use another strategy here to release when needed,1
32869,i think the test could be   wdyt ,0
32869,agreed  thats a crappily named test ,0
32732,to clarify  does the html file get written to   also  isnt in source control should it be added ,0
32732,yes  both are working now neither were working until i changed them,0
32222,missing docs  if you add these tags  they need docs otherwise we get warnings out of javadoc also line ,1
32355,this was easy to get rid of  so i did,1
32881,initially i loaded the context in the  module instead of the  module we can delete this line,1
32888,please use  and  with if statements,1
32888, should take care of that you either have it and its in shadowh  or you dont i havent seen it done in a different way its not posix  so we might run into other implementations  ,1
32888,this is a direct copy from  should i fix both  ,1
32896,can we make a reusable function out of this and the same functionality on line  ,1
32773,i think you are right  ill make sure tonight wasnt sure if the node version was different since i switched to using the commonjs form of the syntax  if so  ill remove good question,0
32900,youre right i glanced at it very superficially  and assumed that was the  problem here is the error i get when doing a query count of the following  filter,0
32355,for debugging  probably remove this,1
32900,im trying that now and dont get an error or any noticeable problems  but  then again  also didnt cause an error ,1
32908,this is the relevant change the others are mainly pep changes absorbed after a rebase,1
32904,i wish it made sense to me i dont think gabe ever actually do a thor new on a brandnew machine,1
32904, ya probably not ,0
32915,ensure that when a single file is sent in  the output is a single file and not a list    ,1
32248,lets make this more functional    ,1

32585,lets add something like this so we can override settings without having to fork  ,1
32680,agreed  removing it i just put it in order to mimic the same approach already found at lines  or ,0
32680,yes  the logic you have is correct  and the  is unnecessary    nearby code follows the pattern  followed  unindented  by the successul case you dont have to worry about the successful case being executed when the exce,0
32248,i like your approach i think though that my approach may be a bit more readable but your approach is definitely cleaner,0
32680,now i get what you meant and yes  youre right      i personally would do a massive refactor everywhere that pattern is used in a different branch,0
32966,that is fine  please comment that after you pull it would be difficult to  comment that section on my fork as we build that artifact    on another note  ive seen a few posts where people are interested to  contribute to finagle but are confused about s,0
32680,right  sorry for false alarm,0
32748,will default to a destination that matches your long option name so in this case  the  argument is unnecessary up to you if you want to keep it anyway,1
32978,cool  i still think it might make sense to offer a bulk api in the  server to reduce this thing down to a single   but im ok to merge it asis,0
32986,the needs to be caught and logged carlos  i am thinking closing the selector manager itself is bit extreme  i will make that change and merge it in  if its okay with you,1

32986,i am very interested in reproducing the memory leak  this is your stack right,0
32986,seems its handled already as you mentioned lets do this leave the handling code as it is i will pull in the null check alone  please open a pull request for the leak  if you reproduce it again and   include detailed information ,1
33002,this is fine  but i meant that you should update the readme doc its unlikely that anyone will read this  unless they generate the rdoc,0
33002,also  you might mention that they only need to set this once that is  we wont overwrite it if they dont send it to us when updating the user,1
32222,suggest we add a comment about how to get this to run in sts,1
32222,suggest we add a comment about how to get these tests to run in sts,1
33035,im pretty sure we need to keep the domain name here this script is meant to potentially be used on arbitrary external domains,0
32781,hhamon keeping localized in the name is a good idea imo twig already has filters to format date and numbers in the core the difference here is that these filters are using intl,0
33033,as discussed  for consistency  lets make this a link as is done for app commenting,0
33033,minor   for consistency  ive been trying to use the  method whenever more than one property is being set these two lines would thus become    as you did above  with   ,1
32781,and i know it is the same syntax than the previous filter added by myself following a discussion in the twig issue tracker but i find these names quite unreadable  which is why i suggest renaming   them,1
33040,is there a specific exception that happens in this instance  i would really like a less generic rescue here than simply from ,1
33035,it seems like this section of code could be simplified if we just always return a thumbnail from our servers instead of sometimes linking somewhere else the main benefit not hitting the database if   theres an external url  is lost since were now getti,1
32741,if im storing an encryption key for this user  do i need to store an origin as well ,1
33001,this looks not good to me a constant like this  also it changes the default profile picture  i will go ahead and merge this for now but we need to change this,1
33041,could we maybe turn this into a function currently i dont really have a context what these are  it would be nicer to simply ask it a ,1
33041,actually this test looks exactly like the one below minus the typo,0
33040,in my specific case  the error is   but in reality  in under what exception would it be okay to leave an order in an noncompleted state when there is a valid processed payment for the order   also  i   imagine there are many different excepti,1
32921,we left in an unnec pass arg to lower down in this file  lets fix it,1
33054,this wont work most likely consider apppath  how about     ,1
33035,were not always generating the thumbnails were only generating them for json results since thats what the widget uses    that being said  im not opposed to returning a thumbnail of a constant size  hosted by us  instead of sometimes linking offsite,1
33054,yeah i tried that and i came to the conclusion that files that are  included from app should have the app  removed but files that come from  some where else should have that part in the path to avoid confusion and  namespace conflicts    example   confi,0
33035,added a note in,1
33054,so in essence  the app folder is special  all other folders will be referenced with the name of the containing folder,1
33035,that breaks  returns something which already includes a domain  its not perfect  but its easily fixed if users set to a full http path,1
33050,i think that normal users are not granted permission to view items by default when using cancan cancan is a whitelist system,1
33054,this one is a bit tricky  ill hack around tomorrow to find great solution,1
33054,thanks   ,0
33063,although thie has a nice ring  well go with your change,0
33045,i went to to test something out     we never discard sources      the default value of zero true in the config does work if i tested this correctly,1
33070,should this be defaults to the system default temporary directory or something like that ,1
33070,ah  that makes much more sense thanks for all your contributions by the way,0
32732,they were working  at least the db hit counter was why would they stop  they stopped after i changed the db password  but started again when i changed it back   ,1
32732,i cant change the password on the server until the changes in the code are made please remove it from your copy i removed it from the repository copy if you cant  we should get the changes into   production asap,1
32732,yes and yes how do i do that ,0
33045,i think this is another point in favor of my original true false method youre using numbers and numeric tests which is still bastardizing types just like using true false not you personally  but   proponents of   while i claim true false is much more,1
32732,i checked the repository first  it is not  it is  sorry about the confusion is in the repository and there are html files in there some of them are hardcoded for the present like quotes,1
32680,the thing is that i had the   problem after enabling the sharing feature in the plugin  while i had never ever faced it before without the sharing option    that is why i thought about creating a test for the specific scenario where i found the prob,1
33072,oops  pull in  cleanup after     sent from my windows phone    ,1
33076,i think this is reversed  we want ctrl g on win and ctrl l on mac on mac  cmd g is already mapped to find next,1
33078,i think erik purged the crlfs that were already there in my copy of this branch over to there are no crlf issues,1
33078,cool hard to tell from these github diffs,1
33077,this function should probably have a test its not entirely clear what form the  object should take,1
32792,is there a reason you did it this way   to me  if there is a session owner it should define the auto close behavior  but maybe you ran into a practical issue there     specifically i would think  ,1
33076,it looks like is pretty well supported ff  chrome  ie   so to simplify things maybe we should just use that ,0
33076,the strings have already been concatenated  so i think you want the last arg to be just ,1
33087,havent checked this yet  but are you sure about removing the  and  closing tags ,1
33087,i in fact should not be    ill update the pull request    thanks,1
33088,probably dont want to leave code in that is commented out in future months youd wonder if it wasnt valid  or wasnt completed,1
32992,i see you changed this from what happens under the hood to something that describes the intent   should we surface whats under the hood   maybe not at the stakeholders level,1
33091,please use braces here instead of just a newline and tab to represent code within the if block ,1
33091,what does  mean  talks about using  for  perhaps you could write a line to document what   does  as its not very clear from just reading the code ,1
33084,lots of macros here can you move the macros inside the function body to avoid duplicating the function header ,1
33035,okay  ill look for write a template tag which fixes the url so its always absolute,0
33035,indeed    constantsized thumbnails sounds like a good idea to me  but it belongs in a separate branch,0
33115,isnt with arguments is deprecated  and you are already using thus silentrules looks redundant,1

33124,please add  to your global git   its a personal choice much like editors are,1
33076,did you want to swap in the upgraded regexps that glenn came up with  or wait until later ,1
32781,maybe we can go for something like  ,1
33138,it would be preferable if you could use tabs when you modify this project,1
33076,we can remove this commentedout stuff  right ,1
33076,ideally this should be based on the editor mode  since the file extension  language mapping will be under the users control  for now  could we spin off a cleanup bug or add this as a bullet in  the   fileextension user story ,1
33076,this comment should probably be in the params jsdoc instead of down here,1
33076,for all these function args  we should document the expected signature  eg for filter  also  i think closure is picky about the f being lowercase,1
33148,alright  and what do with the javaapi ie dont have to explicitly provide ec when you dont have one ,1
33142,replaycing import with uses here will make the plugin break because import will return true or false because it will try to load the file and we used it here to detect if this helper is present to improve   this in  this needs to be done somehow differe,1

33155,why the split between impl and inttests       do we foresee a api spi module coming here     if we only have one exported artifact  we should name it exclude the impl,1
33076,the callers of this check truthiness  so trying to go to line  return value  will be ignored  callers could explicitly check for undefined or isnan instead,1
33155,dont rely on shrinkwrap view type  check ending instead the type could be anything  the is what the container understand    related  ,1
33076,not to nitpick temporary ui too much  but it we might want to experiment with rightalignment  i think it could work even better,1
33158,please use  tags and fix the indentation  tab   spaces,1
32853,row was a better name for this variable  my objection was to using it in the inlinetable when it isnt a row  just use a different variable  ,1
33076,this should be now  i believe nj changed it but id bet its easier when you merge to just ditch his changes to this file and redo the rename yourself,1
33076,is it correct that keyin is camelcase but keydown isnt   if thats the actual smart autocomplete api  maybe we should add a comment to make it clear its not a typo on our end,1
33076,and also need to be escaped although not as uris  just  and  need to be escaped  do we have a regexp utility for this somewhere already ,1
32226,i copied it form the callback above,1
33076,i think itd be helpful to have a comment here saying what the type of  is  it took me a while skipping around the file to figure it out,1
33076,ideally we would leverage here instead of having our own mapping constants  if thats tricky to do at this point  could you add a todo ,1
33076,none of the windows editors i tried select the line when you go to it most just put the cursor on column   personally i think thats better  since usually when you go to a line you want to read it   rather than copy cut delete the whole line  and its ,1

33382,i would change all  of these to lets and delete this before block    i dont have a personal problem with before but ive seen it heavily recommended that before be avoided due to potential headaches down the road,1
32148,i like the thought,1
32355,dry suggests we need something for them  renames may be a good idea  but the only other option is to actually repeat this code each time it occurs,0
32148,i thought i had added a new comment here  the ones below are necessary class methods  if you dont like the name  we can fix that  they are used in more than one place  so dry suggests a   method somewhere  and this seems the right place for it,1
32148,no  the point is you can test it for existence with nil   it will return the card if it is real  would you suggest a   postfix for the one that does the new below and make this one no postfix ,1
33424,i think this is only on the initial photos  like background photos and the default profile pic  all users need access to those,1
33424,correct  is only used for the initial photos in  otherwise  we encounter the error i described in a previous comment,1
32148,im working on it  i suspect we may need to keep it around for a while so that migrations will run  ive had similar with the cardtype model,1
32148,well have to carry this one forward as something we still want to fix,1
32148,this is implemented now ive also cleaned up as many of the references as i could    you can delete when you review this,1
32148,methods ending in   should be booleans  methods ending in   have two common meanings   ruby calling object will be altered  eg     rails raise error on failure eg    this isnt either of those    im thinking about f,1
32148,done added the codename to the error message for easier diagnosis,1
33424,how about using the local variable user defined up there ,1
33424,oops  missed that when copying the conditional down,0
33076,i added a task to this backlog card  remember user mode per file extension as a user when i open a file and specify a specific mode i want brackets to remember my descision,1
32148,as it turns out  i had to move more of the migrations up before the codenames one  because it uses all sorts of core wagn code to do its thing  it needs the table names and columns to already be the   new ones  so all the structural migrations go first  t,1
33382,how could i not do this after all smiley,1
33010,i think we could use some smart default based on the method name,1
33076,with glenns work for js inline editors we can i was keeping this around to get the context around the regex results ill remove it,1
33445,i thought about it  but one thing to another  wed really want to wrap every single i o calls lets keep it targeted to observed conditions for now hopefully  at some point well have a way to get the   site offline during updates,1
33445,seems safe to add these around all read operations  since they should be less likely to fail but sure if we want to fix each problem as it arises thats fine by me,1
33309,its in and appeared to be used once we went back to the wide version of openbook,1
33076,ill have a look and if its easy to replace ill grab them if not i will log a clean up task ultimately we probably want the language intelligence stuff factored out as a plugin that both clients can use,1
33309,added a line then deleted so no change,1
33309,its only as big as it needs to be while sets a defined size,1
33076,i like it  i wanted to move the list out of the way so the user can see symbol or line highlighting this looks much better,0
33115,   how automake can help in silencing make    to enable the use of silentrules in his package  a developer needs to do  either  of the following        add the silentrules option as argument to      call the macro ,1
33076,yes  that is the api i added a comment to avoid confusion,0
33076,i put an encode function in this file for now i sent a team email to figure out which encode decode code we want to use and where the shared code should live,1
33451,you need to do something proper on the exception it is very important to handle it well we dont want to show the user the exception trace handle it  show a proper message to the user,1
33076,haha  that makes two of us i had to think about it too    i started with the comment  but then thought renaming the variable to fileinfo was more concise and removed the need for a comment,0
33451,yes i tested it and it reverts back to the previous state for all the fields associated with it,0
33463,it would be nice if youd test this  i put a check in so that it doesnt yell at me every time about there not being an ae checkbox p,1
33076,this occurs when you type  plus something else and then delete backwards its triggered when the  is deleted since no plugin will match this code gets hit more when the is enabled  but since the   code requires the matching character to ,1
33457,yo dawg  i herd u like data    sorry i named this data    maybe iadata  or blobs  or    ,0
33076,i wrote this before joels plugin code landed my intent was for quick open to make this interface public so a new plugin could call new on this and then register by passing an object rather than the   bag of functions do you think i should go with this ,1
33469,awww  i liked that space note this is funny,0
33470,we should throw a try except block around the news stories  just in case the google feed isnt reachable ,1
32801,when changing tables that possibly are already in the database in the case of updating an installation it is good practise to create a migration for that change ,1
33469,jwcrypto  is published  we can update to that,1
33469,lets improve this comment  its ambiguous and could be a merge blocker,1
33469,can we get rid of it now  or is does invoke callback before function completion ,1
33469, awesome  updates to test coverage  i did a cursory sampling  but love how many new areas were testing,1
33483,i think we should specify that a grey strip  without a name  is another nurses vacation segment and then should we be explicitly clear that just because theres a grey stripe doesnt mean that they   cant schedule ,1
33483,maybe link below to schedule a vacation segment ,1
33483,should we mention that deleting a unit will delete all the nurses vacations for nurses in that unit ,1
33434,i guess it could be an unapply  but it should rather return an either then use fold in line      the match  uses the   then  of the case class,1
33158, is for marking the string as translatable by gettext  same for  or  in gsettings schemas     is a programing convention meaning that the attribute is private to an object and should not be accessed direct,1
33457,you know  we could do this one on the backend too  ,1
33499,i think that a missing dependency should be logged as a  ,1
33508,yeah  i know  but it was only one line,0
33507,maybe make this if statement a little more readable eg extra vars,1
33507,fixed it in the next push  reused dir  ,0
33504,i guess you can simplify things and make the code more general  have a look to this simple implementation    i would expect to use a sourcemodel which is a container in this way  ,1
33507,im going to remove this onemaybe its more of a project specific function  ,1
33504,good idea  ill change that,0
33507,add a parrameter  true or false   and let that one decide weather to catch doted files or not,1
33522,its preferrable to changed state before setting it as a parameter in the action and check parameters    although some actions may store a live reference to the parameter  others may not  resulting in an undesired behaviour  furthermore  im aware some a,1
33522,we want users to provide a value for it assignation is just to provide a default value  we can not use final here s,1
33490,it does  as match with multiple properties is used in all cases  i changed this in new commit anyway  to keep consistent with other multiple version fields already in fixture,1
33523,iep  this should be removed there is no need to call it twice see below,1
33522,wow  unused code    great    less lines here ,0
32801,makes sense  looks like there is an upgrade method in this file  would that be the best place to do it   still relatively new to pyro and oss contribs  i just dont want to make a migration convoluted by   trying to implement it somewhere stupid  thank yo,0
33158,thanks  this is kind of new to me,0
33457,lloyd  when does this get invoked   when can sampling be enabled but there not be   it looks like is created as soon as this module is run  and cleared only when session context comes in and the   user has not been selected for samp,1
33490,i know  but php does allow it   i asked docb about this way of hiding things from interface and he is ok with it,1
33457,lloyd  excellent note  i should have put that in there myself  perhaps instead of having a discrepancy with the upstream  i should just change upstream to pass the name of the message,0
32629,we could wrap these  ifs in a if  debug  and then check for each case only if debug is true,1
33457,a note in general about this module  i am converting it to be a pagemodule  primarily for unit testing  having items as a page module means we get to start them several times in sequence  each   with different options  as well as eventually allowing us t,1
33546,could you put this sample code in a source file and import it so it is compiled ,1
33457,are these intended to be there only for development ,1
32801,added a migration for this column,1
33550,you used a here  i think an would work better a select is used to reduce the array down by returning true false to use again later,1
33411,i get this now  ignore me  ,0
33537,could you change this to  ,1
33457,when is this data saved to   more importantly  when is this saved to the backend  only upon reinvocation of the dialog   if that is the case  we may lose a valuable data point if we have a potential   user who tries once  decides it,1
32853,if the row is created from a volatile transform from a random number  we need not transform  or itll create a new random number on every row of the resulting dataset so   is valid for both types of   rows,1
32853,this is also being optimized  as the compiler recognizes it as constant  even tough its stored as a variable     im not sure how to force this to be volatile  but in theory  the  check should deal with it ie break in case it is,1
32853,the  check aborts this case successfully  and none of the others  and none of the regression cases  too,1
33568,the package name should be in the params file  even if its the same on all the platforms we currently support this will make any future porting to other platforms a little bit easier,1
33457,can we get a happy case test for this ,1
33573,sorry  i forgot about responding to this  ive added a commit that deals with that now  thanks for the feedback,1
33578,given parameter has no ip address  action should fail on checking parameters with provided one    we should either provide a with an  or change the interface definition to make accept ,1
33576,timothy warren wrote    uri string  the default setting of auto works for most servers  if your links do not seem to work  try one of the other delicious flavors  ,1
33583,three ways  and        besides  is it necessary to support  both  password and oauth token ,1
33587,i had thought of that but then decided not to change states  what i really wanted was  and   but this aint haskell   can we rename  to  or something that resembles module and  to  ,1
33457,this is accurate to what they were shown instead of us reparsing acceptlanguage headers,0
33537,rather not they are going to drop php versions so there is a pretty big chance that  will be on that list also there are some issues with that version on travis due to compatibility issues on ubuntu    so testing on  should be suffici,1
33570,anchor is a resource  you dont need to include class to use the anchor resource it just needs to be in the modulepath,1
33591,same as for should be renamed  imo  can be prefixed by  eventually,1
33596,this is actually the  old  syslog instance  per  you then go on to return the old value,1
33537,i can rename it though the correct name is uppercase and iirc there is something in the phpbb coding guidelines about using uppercases with regards to names  i can be mistaken though didnt check so if it doesnt it can indeed be lowercased  al,1
33537,i just checked and its in the phpbb x coding guidelines i dont have a strong feeling for ether so ill convert them into lower case in a following commit,1
33598,we should still register the script just not enqueue it,1
33469,i agree that this should be fixed  i dont have an immediately simple way to do this that doesnt cause browserify to bloat the bidbundle  and the goal was to keep that minimal are you okay with my   delaying a fix for this until the next rev ,0
33469,as it turns out   was already there and not used  i noticed the same thing i chose not to take it out yet agree that cleaning up dead code is something we should do do we have an easy way to detect   dead code ,1
32992,got it  thanks for explaining,0
33469,agreed  ill fix this,0
33603,the color should probably be from the  to prevent introducing another red color,1
33469,  to lloyds comment  or  would be more immediately comprehensible though i missed the fact that the abbreviation maps to the spec at   which is a mitigating factor,1
28089,btw i think nokogiri has real canonicalization support now,1
33608,this is a trillion times better,1
33616,i think this should be a ,1
33587,the thing is we can get this working for  as well thus we can evolve to        thus the last one in chain is not necessari,1
33617,cool  this will capture the most critical places to message the user,1
33616,that depends  i made it  emulating githubs behaviour,1
33452, is a wrapper around the fortran compiler that was used to build openmpi as far as i know it doesnt have any fundamental changes compared to the program that it wraps except for adding a few   preprocessor definitions and linker include paths by,1
33622,is there any way to do this with accessibility ,1
33626,this is fine grained in the detect script,1
33283,youre right concerning  for dz  you can simply loop over its elements  and zero them there may be a simpler way  depending on what your op is actually doing  anyway  you should launch the test with ,0
33537,thanks yeah  variables dont need uppercase for instance  is all lowercase,0
33537,yes  i know but i recalled a rule on that  but obviously im way ahead off everyone with the coding guidelines that ive got in mind  p,0
33626,ah  ok  becuase its  maybe just rename the method then to   ,0
33626,yes  i think i was testing something and didnt revert the change to,0
33537,lol you should go ahead and get started on phpbb  so you can use those guidlines if you get it started  it might not take so long to get it done when we get around to it    just kidding ,0
33537, slap     on a more serious note though  unknownbliss wouldnt allow me because i   must   work on this p,1
33640,the reason i had the floats here was that when the window was too small  these numbers would go from one row to like  rows would this problem come back by removing the floats   ,1
33537,the above two  can simply be  and  respectively,1
33640,i thought we should do this for other accordions like activities and the as well specifying the  we can do that in another commit though ,1
33641,this is on a button  so should be in the form of a verb phrase eg format saml response,1
33537,dropped the first one and fixed the second,1
33641,also  what happens if someone used the form for attributes  but also set the same thing in free form jit field  does it matter if they are using subject or attribute for user id  see comment below about   testing,1
33640,as a general comment  please test the functionality of the elements you replace within the html  since some jquery logic depend on the relative relations of these elements although should not be   ideally  ,1
33640,do we really need this   where would we need to use this   any reason we would keep this around   ,1
33644,cmcavoy take a look at this and see if you think this is a reasonable start,1
33283,done  i ran  python test and there are no warning related to  however  there are some for the other ops in ,0
33640,ok cool now i got it ,0
33648,is this the unused return value warning you were talking about  because theres another  a couple lines before that hasnt been wrapped,1
33640,they are now inside a fixed size six columns container so that will not happen the new ui only changes column sizes at cut off points and the column size does not get smaller than px so it   should be fine,1
33646,here you reintroduce a superfluous else according to samueltardieu   as the previous condition leaves the method i am not sure if i am in the same boat with him in this case  but i wanted at   least to ask if it was a deliberate decision or an accide,1
33648,yes it was  dammit sorry for this  fixed with,0
33641,agree that the names are confusing  just tried to get it working with minimal changes  for now we can just rename the var and leave the refactoring as a todo item   ,0
33653,can you please rewrite these examples to the new syntax rather than removing them ,1
33644,yep  it seemed suspicious that i was getting rid of so much earlier and it was ,0
33076,actually  i was able to copy paste the new regex expressions i cant share the code easily yet  but i left a comment out factoring out the functionality into a share js intelligence module,1
33655,i see no problems with that   help a noob here should i make a second pr or is it possible to edit this one ,1
33655,it will minify to one char anyway  so better to be succinct ,1
33655,no worries if youd like to update the pr that would be great  otherwise one of us can do it,1
33641,if the user selects subject there is no issues at all  say the user selects attribute and the name to be say   if the user now sets something like  in the free from jit field  as long this value is correct the   assertion wo,1
33644,through socialshare  presumably facebook uses the full power of open graph data for tweeting it seems to use the format  no idea what it does for google ,1
33537,erikfrerejean it happens occasionally,1
33667,you need to inherit from the params class if you intend to use variables from its scope as class param defaults,1
33644,hrmph  theres also a way to create your own opengraph objects which is probably what we ultimately want to do as we wont be able to aggregate stuff easily if we dont have a custom o,1
33653,done  ive also removed some old debug code that was lying around for a long time heh,0
33653,true   to get and  to set would make the api a bit cleaner than it currently is  i already talked to stojg about this  and he didnt like the  etc either sminnee what do you think ,1
33537,committed a change that will allow the creation of setters if required  simply add a  method to the object and the rest is handled i do not like the idea of using setters for the sake of using setters   because maybe somewhere in the future,1
32789,well  the thing is join accepts any iterator  so you can use a generator instead of a list the following  expressions are equivalent actually  the generator ones should even be more efficient    ,1
33668,if im understanding this line correctly  youre calling the method from the superclass  which is a nop that always returns false this seems like it would hinder performance for no reason or am i   missing something ,0
33626,would have helped if i looked at the code ,1
33668,you are correct  i added it for simmetry with elementend which does do  stuff in case theres ever common code we can push up i can remove it  with no harm if you prefer it  ,0
33641,just a thought  if the user selects attribute radio button  what if we disable username or federated id text field and basically force the user to add the attribute in the additional attributes text area    if we go that route  we can remove the attribut,1
32789,i agree lists are easier to manipulate but in case of duplicates it might cause unexpected results  i think the api should be strict as it is low level stuff not being strict might hide some errors dont you think ,0
33668,dateutil contains a very good datetime parser that undertands all the  possible formats that can appear in an xml file in utc  with a timezone   year first  etc    maybe theres an alreadyincluded way of doing it  but i was unable to find  it a simple rege,1
33676,this allows to launch awx in fullscreen on ios devices when added to home screen,1
33076,i would suggest the bag approach and moving the documentation down to here  there are so many args to that i think its actually easier to read code creating a bag than to try to figure out the   meanings of an unlabeled arg list just by ,1
33675,if this is for debugging purposes  please remove it,1
33668,you can keep the method definition in the superclass as a nop if you like the symmetry i also like symmetry  but please dont bother calling it from inside the methods in the subclasses for now if it   ever grows to be more than a nop we can add the c,1
33076,i was thinking wed upgrade to return enter and escape for these cases    ideally  all nonprintable keys should be mapped to friendly names by or else we wont be able to register shortcuts for t,1
32482,the privileges are casesensitive in current master as far as i can tell  caseinsensitive privileges should never have worked correctly if you can confirm that these privileges used to work  ill try to get   caseinsensitive privileges working in the ne,1
33668,well  i just looked over googles documentation and it seems that they follow iso  loosely  the only difference being everything after the year is optional     if that is the case  ,1
33668,sorry  read a bit more and realized that kml takes more timezones than just utc  my bad im not sure what to think now,0
33076,oops  this actually crashes now  it looks like someone made private  im fine with changing it to public again though,1
33668,nitpicky is good  makes the code better     id say dont merge yet  tomorrow ill try to improve the performance a  little and fix the tests im not sure about the dateutil  though  ,0
33668,youre right  i think dateutil is probably necessary and the more i think about it  the more i want to put dateutil into the gpx code to improve consistency there ill have to benchmark that though  ill   only make that switch if its faster and it coul,0
32789,fair enough  ill make the required changes,0
32148,agreed  the good news is we have at least one test that will fail  so if we fix it  we can remove this and the tests will still pass,0
33076,if you have two of the same selector in a file  i think this would only let you select the first one  seems like some work to fix  though  so if you want to spin this off as a bug im ok with that just let   me know when youve filed it,1
33693,actually  after looking it up  it seems you can only alias a namespace the compiler has seen a declaration for already so the right substitution to make would be something like    becomes,1
33693,hmmm that might work  ill try it    ,0
33693,note that there are more ways for namespace llvm  to get mangled by whitespace and not to be recognized  than there are for a simple replace of llvm  but ill give it a try    ,1
33693,agreed but theres also using namespace llvm to detect when using the other method    the good thing is that once done  we could recompile any llvm application without changes and maybe even submit this patch to the houdini folks   ,0
32839,im actually pretty sure that latest currently doesnt work as a fallback so this ones still left,0
32839,done in  but i ended up going back to  and actually using the validity of the form,0

33792, returns empty array so we should probably start to dig from here,1
33792,interesting fact    if we swap,1
33786,would also be good to join flags into one define  since they seem all the same,1
33799,can you change the control flow to this     ,1
33786,ive seen this in examples around the web,1
33786,why add all files in directory    it looks to me  after reading the man pages quickly as if can monitor the directory directly  youre not returning the events anyway  but if you monitor the directory  you can still find out which fil,1
33786,there could be  events  although theyre being thrown away anyway,1
33786,so  every loop you register inotify handles  check for changes and reregister  i could be wrong  but it seems wasteful  and might not get some events in between the checks    i think you should init the inotify on constructor and clean on destructor,1
33799, already checks for the  header should i move that here ,1
33674,the locators are named a bit differently this is not a element at all its just an input checkbox so line  needs to be changed to just find the element and click it line  is not required,1
33786,with at  on modern systems  that starts to get a little large to allocate on the stack,1
33786,most of the time  there wont be that many i think a dynamic array with lower bound of about  concurrent events is probably a better choice,1
33674,you can move this bit to the top of the page with the other imports then it can be used within the class,1
33799,yes  someone reading the code needs to know that this method only is relevant if the header is present,0
33401,done in next commit,0
33674,you need to restore this locator because its used below    nb this technique of locating probably wont be used in the future but at the moment we are just trying to keep the test layout the same and migrate to webdriver ,1
33674,need to prefix this with  and for the locator you need to reference the one on line  above so remove   this will make it reference the local variable rather than the class variable ,1
33774, is the pref  where are the white space you mean ,1
33774,because the profile gets recreated,1
33774,oh wait so the second entry is the value the tuple confused me i just expected a hash sorry,1
33774, and gets a new folder name to make it better readable i would store the path operation in the same variable further asserts in this test could benefit from,1
33774,since that is the end of the test i dont see the value of doing that if someone doesnt read the code properly it till could be seen as using the same directory even though it changed,1
33824,can you fix the extra spaces before the equal sign ,1
33786,because the last read would block until there was a change,1
33825,what about  exception  i see python code handles this one too,1
33825,ah  i see  thats  for ruby client and youre doing this check few lines above,0
33828,i have these in my global gitignore file as you end up adding these lines to every file,1
33828,as this method isnt in oscar  i cant really merge the pull request yet as it would break other installs    one option would be to patch oscar to support this method but before i do that  id like to understand a little more about why you need to link t,1
33839,sorry juste figured  this have nothing to do with your commit,1
33847,this is not defined on os x so it throws a timespec redefined compile error youll need to a more compatible way to handle this,1
33847,the easiest fix would be to just change that line to  since the only reason its there is to define something the windows headers dont,1
33847,okay  ill just make that change then no need to bother with a pull request  thanks ,0
33845,what if the instance hasnt yet been added to  ,1
33847,thanks very much     ive got an osx machine here so ill be sure to test any changes i make from hereon out though i think the c code is safe now ,0
33845,same re class templating,0
33863,this is a os project  but i still expect quality code somehow these nested  seems a code smell to me could you refactor this basically i think you need another class that is responsible for explain   what  mean something li,1
33864,hashtags entities are on a text property ,1
33840,thanks for pinging  will look again,0
33872,when a component is idle it means that it doesnt want to receive tick messages  but if its message queue is not empty  it will be activated by the simulator regardless  meaning its active    i guess running and idle are not the correct names,1
33872,should that change take place in soosim or soosimui  i understand its the latter iff they talk about different things    would it make more sense to use the small step by default  would it help us avoid this issue  so that running means running an,1
28089,great   i will look into that,0
33886,i think we actually want this the other way around  since traitsui is the newest version ,1
33888,is this else needed ,1
33893,filereader is in chrome  ff  opera missing from stable safari not sure why caniuse is reporting partial for ff op i just pinged fyrd to ask why     suggested     supported in chrome  firefox  opera safari is currently missing filereader support,1
33895,oh  this is not used anywhere else from what i can see,1
33897,not really related to this commit  but it seems like this instrumentation might actually belong in the ,1
33899,we should use the enums here instead of the literal value,1
33899,same here  or we can just check the range and assign  something like        otherwise throw or n,1
33900,this is very pretty,0
33894,i added the x because using the bootstrap the left hand column would have to be  or  when set to  with the x image  the image looked totally lost when using x on   the  width  the image overflowed too much that it over took t,1
33909,will there always be a completion time  ie if this comes back null   empty what happens with the parse,1
33909,just a test  can you receive this  ,1
33901,fixed  hope thats what you meant i took it over from one of the other checks where its also wrong then,1
33792,i was trying it on live app by dropping in some puts and just refreshing page,1
33923,sorry  working in the same line of work is redundant uses work twice and too broad ,0
33881,dchelimsky should comment  imho you dont want any permanent comments or pending specs ,1
33923,yep  doing the same job is a simpler way of saying employed in the same profession my priority is conversational language thats conducive to sharing on social networks,0
33923,i agree about the attraction of piquant text  but do you see that job is misleading in this context  as if it referred to any particular job position   it will make people think if only i was a man  i would   get  more for doing this same job  which ,0
33909,also  we should add a convenience helper method on cloudtable to consturct a query against itself,1
33923,im using job and occupation or profession interchangeably here for the sake of brevity and simpler language  and i dont think its misleading  especially given the further explanation on the page,1
33935,i like explicit return values over implicit ones  but could be convinced otherwise,1
33722, escaped to  after helpful comment from naomi ,1
33901,oops now i fixed it for all checks,0
33469,yeah  this needent block merge,0
33941,this file is also included in pr ,1
33948, is if the user associated with conn is in room x  not if nickname is in room,1
33910,yikes i think you are right  have fixed,0
33951,why is this a jmxoperation vs jmxgetter  please make these changes and i will pull this in,1
33952,yes  it can will update it,0
33889,thanks  i removed the puts in commit,0
33889,yes  because of,0
33889,yeah  it would be nice if that before filter didnt get executed for every context in this spec file,0
33452, so is it alright to keep it as  then     no  when compiling mpi code  one should be using the mpi compilers,1
33961,i think this extra  around key is a bug,1
33961,in the other types  is private and set is the main api maybe we could print a deprecation message here,1
33978,ya  its a bit of a hack  this function is only used on the search page right now  i need to perform those checks  so maybe i could move it into a search helper  so its not considered a base helper,0
33980,mostly out of curiosity  but why change from  to  the whole object and then indexing it  do you ever need to get the properties that previously werent persisted  its not a big deal  but the previous   method used less storage,1
33980,this could be renamed to something more meaningful what does source mean  also  not a huge fan of introducing combined getter setters in this style of code,1
33986,in my case i still use   so the code is still valid but it can be updated for ,1
33986,stof find is required here because you always point to a type that is an actual doctrine entity class   also  deserializing sets the valid directly  which does not load the proxy if i use instead  which leads to weird situations,1
33986, already have a in the doctrine bridge for the orm only so if your code is ormonly  it could use this interface some methods in it are deprecated in  as the doctrine common names are a bit   different but they are still there for,0
33986,oh  so it will always be the entity class name  not the proxy class name  ,1
33986,im going to update the code today then ,0
33910,this should work fine  but you can just do ,0
33910,yep thats right  doesnt work p,0
33677,it does happen code falls through and returns a  in the event of an error    is this considered bad coding style  i could see how it may be considered obfuscated,1
33864,hashtag entities are under hashtags property  but each entity has text property to store the hashtag value  and only hashtag entity has text property    eg             ,1
33997,please learn the alphabet  s is before t yep ,1
33998,yep  thats a good idea,0
33999,dam   i was sleeapy sorry let me fix that,0
34001,we should allow all events if the set is empty  maybe make a predicate method ,1
33991, is used to solve problems that specifically affect  bit builds on snow leopard that involve the accelerate framework when vector dot products are calculated i believe the issues were solved in the   lion release,1
33991,i will use macosversion      yes  this or  is the correct thing to do if you want to apply  on snow leopard     is actually snow leopard or greater  and  is just a wrapper,0
33951,ill clean it up,0
33951,the whole code is based in the   so some of the commandline arguments came with the code  ive modified the class to accept it as a parameter  because i think can there may be cases were may be   needed to recalculate the file,1
33991,next time ill remember to check those references  thanks for the info   on that topic  i see that the relevant lines in the aforementioned and are  ,1
33980,if you want i can change it back to setting each property individually but ive avoided this as each setting parses the json string into an object  sets the property on that object and then stringifies it   again this probably isnt really a performance is,1
33980,as ive said in another comment  getting actually parses the json string  so its just an optimisation parsing it just once  instead for each getter im not sure what  if any  the performance impact   would be to do it the normal way,1
33980,source provides easy and clean read write access to the underlying  string if you want i could split this into   or another name that you prefer ,1
10147,ive added a  array where i save all the moves of the fighter for the match then i can acces to this array with fight method,1
10147,ive replaced the  method for the  with an  because now in each turn the ranking for the move is different,1
32801,i also meant to ask if updating the file to include the was necessary desired in addition to the hash  hadnt heard differently id imagine the sets up a fresh install while the migrations handle the   upgrade,1
32801,yep     emailing from my iphone s like a boss ,1
34030,could you explain what exactly is being done here   also  since im extending the joomla platform  you should be able to get the  superglobal through jinput try ,1
34030,hi michael     if you are connecting to the same site  you need to include all cookies to  keep the session open     it shouldt be activated to an external connection    in the original include component plugin  its used to load a component      regar,1
34036,probably should cd to  first  rather than cding around and relying on cwd  i usually prefer to use explict paths    eg  ,1
34036,we should probably use ,1
34036,should we actually check a call to ruby v as well in case build fails partway  or does it not touch that dir till fully successful ,1
34036,does this have sufficient progress output to keep the capistrano connection open  or should we output the dots like we did for rvm ,1
34036,we should probably just remove the rvm specific stuff and force an upgrade to rubybuild  while this script may work  other things might break since we removed rvm references from other places like crontab  etc,1
34036,used to be  we needed to use the system ruby here because the aws bundle script run on instance would not work with newer ruby  may not be the case anymore  but you should test this  ,1
34036,im open to improvements here  but the only problem i see with overwriting the existing file is the path wont point to the old ruby  but  even with a separate file  it cant point to the old ruby    otherwise none of the gems will install properly  and i,1
34036,it will just use the ruby in the path  we could hardcode it to be safe  but it seemed like a potential referential integrity problem,1
34047,could you add some code to do something like    so  any args prefixed with  would only be passed with the jobname removed to one of the particular jobs   this is useful because there could be c,1
34036,ok  didnt think about the local use case  but in that case ones env is already setup by rvm when running from command line  this script is really only needed for running rubber from cron    if you can get things to work without forcing upgrade  go for,0
34047,i think we could do this instead with a companion object so you dont need to make mutable    so  ,1
34047,it would be nice  as you mentioned  to actually run a test job one that we already have  for instance    you are right  you will need to change this line,1
34052,very good but can you also change mirage so we do not have to use extra time in fixing it  too ,0
34057,i think you do need it in quotes,1
34057,should this say   or     or something to convey that it doesnt have to be the full note name,1
34057,oh  you do magic with ,0
34057,note sure if we want to document that usage in the future we may want to add arguments maybe,1
34065,this is pretty minorbut its good in doc comments to surround named code elements like options with backticks so they stand out as code elements  so this last line would have  rather than or   whatever,0
34065,if you do keep this as a private helper method  itd be nice to use the  method rather than  directlywhen possible  its nice to use the pubic api even internally,1
34065,one other thing needs to maintain the same interface as a full   so whatever public methods wind up being added here need to be added there typically as a noop,1
34065,actually  thinking about this some moreit might be good to add a test for that have a test that finds all the public instance methods of  that were defined directly on it  and not on an ancestor  and   assert that  has a,1
34065,this should be  rather than   right ,0
33895,if you are refering to and   it was done so the unit tests would pass cli assumes you only are parsing args once per execution,1
34065,it looks like youre missing the call to this should be called from   i think,1
33961,besides the deprecation warning  we could rename to and make private  the protocol is already broken at this class  so i dont think it would be a problem   then can we remove the deprecation and rename ,1
34072,thanks  you remembered ,0
34073,is there a way to tune perltidy to allow the original  that is  if the only argument to a function or method is a hash ref or array ref  for that matter  have it open on the same line as the parens,1
34085,i think this should expose  at least  the silent arg  and probably also the keys    in my example  i have sliders that trigger execute  so my prompt count quickly rises into the hundreds while,1
34094,you should add to documentation that this additional library is required we have one list of python libraries used by nodewatcher,1
34056,expressions are trees example the range function uses three other expressions filter is a method on all expressions  used to find subexpressions in the tree  aggregate expressions deeply nested   inside other expressions    makes sense ,1
34073,sorry  the comment was in the wrong place i was not objecting to   but to the realignment of the  lines  below  the comment sorry  havent used gh diff comments much,1
34073,oh  and the defaults are fine with me  here,0
34111,please  add a ,1
34073,for code this is a simple  we add a  option to     podtidy also has a option  but no file option so you are asking for a feature request from either hard or easy since i control the l,1
34112,apologies  ide did some automatic whitespace cleanup there,1
34112,guess i let myself get misled by the  call on top that change fixed it so i errantly assumed it was correct  in that case  theres some other issues with that file in general      theres no checking to ensure that redis class a,1
34114,now works if more than one package matches  added options just like yums ,1
34115,it is  but  is supposed to return a string that can be used to recreate the object  so it should use the same name,1
34117,i wrote a blog post about this once  ,1
34122,where is this statement  we should mention the file we are changing ,1
34122,maybe we should simply use the uri module that comes with elixir ,1
34122,instead of forcing users to call manually  instead we could use a to automatically add the  before compiling the module,1
34126,i thought maven style dictates  not  wrapping this line   ,1
34127,im curious to find out why you think a language bug is highly likely  in  years of working in php and actionscript  ive never come across a language bug but its certainly possible that i just never happened to try anything that the language design,1
34122,yes  i only included the minimum set of methods to build a keyvalue store introduced at the end,0
34122,so we should implement the delete macro in feb  right  it may be a good opportunity to quickly review the macros of the previous chapter,1
34126,how about reordering attributes as in   that is namespace declarations first with  before ,1
34122,yeah  i will add a so you can do    it will have the advantage of also handling encoded chars,0
34126,we should add a blank line after each and every ,1
34136,you should remove old code instead of commenting it versionning is handled by git  not by comments,1
34136,youre right  i forgot them fixed,0
34126,oops  i missed the exception for pom files the  element is always on one line to the generic rule   always use a column line width    the drawback is that the eclipse formatter can not be used because of this exception,0
34140,how about this instead   its a bit more succinct    ,1
34140, is a primitive value itself so i think this could just be returns  false  for primitive types,1
34126,ok for ordering  but the example dont respect the line wrapping rule of generic code style and convention,1
34140,i think this is clearer as ,0
34146,please add   to secure the other way around    fx my browser gives  which makes the default to  as the danish locale is listed as ,1
34127,i thought maybe its a bug referred to application code  not the language itself    i agree that bugs in the language itself are extremely rare    sent from my iphone,1
34127,yeah  i guess it is quite ambiguous  ill merge in the other changes shortly  thanks for the contributions ,0
34140,technically yes  but since  i think this clarification is needed ,0
34140,yeah  youre probably right got a bit carried away by my random test cases ,0
34152,suggestion    note events may be raised by several threads  such as the gui thread and the audio thread  if a subscriber method calls operations that must be executed in a particular thread  then the subscriber   method is responsible for posting those c,1
34155,the file itself is fine  just github website has header   thats why it looks garbled this applies to all other nonunicode resources,1
34152,sounds good  we could also consider to document this at a central place instead of having this note on every event,0
34140,fair enough  how about returns  false  for primitive types  including   that way we clarify but dont imply that  is not a primitive,0
34116,there are five other instances in this file of the url being quoted and relative to the current file rather than unquoted and relative to the base i like the change made here  but please make it   everywhere else as well consistency is important,1
34116,please remove these comments if these comments are still valid  create a new ticket against puppetdashboard and elaborate on the comments there,1
34122,can we add another example as well that uses  instead of  to make it super clear that we are passing the variable name as argument ,1
34122,one option is to not match against each specific block but simply do this,1
34122,the  and  handlers have different third argument it is a minor difference in this case  but i would still like to keep this explicit for now when it comes time to adding more verbs  ill be able to refactor   ,1
34122,give me a second,1
34176,should add this logic to the model or maybe we should even break creating a status message to some sort of factory object ,1
34184,can you add public in front of the method ,1
34183,could you move this to the previous line   else  ,1
34152,either way is fine with me  but lets make it very noticeable since this is a concern thats both common and subtle,1
34189,i think it would be cleaner to stick this in a utility function at the top of this file  then anytime it is needed   can be called,1
34189,same as above  this should be moved into a utility fn,1
34189,it looks like this file was out of sync with the changes i recently made to it this set of changes is also removing a feature that was recently added,1
34189,perfecto    sent from my iphone,0
34200,fix is here  ,0
34152,ok  lets keep it like that so the ide will tell the programmer when he actually uses the event,0
34211,we depend on memcache for csrf now but we might be able to fix that with a local settings change,1
34209,this will duplicate many things as  contains the normalized record it should probably be limited to     thus  looking at the raven client  it seems wrong the params array is meant to contain params to f,1
34209,while having a convention about the way to provide exception in the context to allow a special handling is fine  im concerned with this implementation it will log only the exception and drop the log   message which could be better to understand the issue,1
34218,should be able to get rid of the conditional        works on mri  and  ,1
34227,i love that we can pull that condition out now,0
34227,if youre going to change the text  it should be method selection not the larges of deals also   is better here  i totally agree,1
34227,i would say includes and not receives here,1
34232,the arrows should be aligned and those strings in double quotes should be in single quotes as per the puppet style guide,1
34224,could we add a couple of specs for eg  as well  add something to the page that calls using  both the success case and the timeout case should be tested ie to make sure  is invoked corr,1
34232,confirmed  what is the expected osfamily of arch  probably archlinux right     basically if its not redhat  debian  suse  or solaris  it falls back to    one could argue that arch deserves its own    i guess the only problem is that since osfami,1
34232,there will need to be more arguments passed here eventually i use source  gem in my manifests   is there a puppet equivalent  of  or  or some way to take an arbitrary number of arguments to a define ,1
34239,this sort of stuff concerns me a bit  we have lots of hardcoded references to file locations this wont work in any of my applications for example    i dont have a suggestion for an improvement right now other than we list stuff like this in accompanyi,1
34239,thats from the older version phil i just copy paste this xml  and only tweak the test directory  since ci did not have some generator   i think we need some console interface  to autogenerate the   file  based by what dev want t,1
34232,i am pretty sure that there are no such things as in the puppet dsl maybe if we wrote it in the ruby version of the puppet dsl,0
34253,agreed  i set headers on a request more often than setting content,0
34256,i would default to an empty array here if it doesnt exist,1
34251,should this use for consistency ,1
34251,any answer to this question   seems like you might be duplicating some level of checks that would run below,1
34251,can you add a little bit of description comments are fine as to why the outcome of each test is as you expect   ie should fail because authoritative and attribute not reachable  should decline   because not authoritative and not reachable  etc so the,1
33872,the change should take place in soosim  so the above code would subsequently change to  doing the small step by default would not change thi,1
33743,did you try to dump definitions for this class  i dont think the class definition is really needed as s runtime definition would probably discover the same values,1
34268,please add original test case that is in bugzilla,1
34269,please add issue number as a comment,1
34270,this should be part of an other pull request  i guess however  as ospf capability pull request has already been accepted  there is no need to split this one in two,1
34270,this method signature is likely to change in the future  accepting a connection  or a however  its not the goal of this pull request to fix that  but only to provide current functionality from a java   interface ,1
18919,hardythe  jayparikh please comment on this line as it is not self explanatory,1
34274,yea  but what does it mean   thatst he question,0
34259,hum  it actually also works without the space  ,0
18919,try to get a true false instead of count using bool,1
34288,can you put the call on its own line ,1
34288,can you remove the space behind the  and put each statement within the if block on its own line  closing curlies also belong on their own line,1
34286,this needs to go before the pull request can be accepted this is just to show off,1
34288,lgtm good find ,0
34286,in reality has no dependencies this is just to show off,1
34286,also note here that if you wanted a specific branch youd just do        neat  of course any flag can be passed here,1
34286,this slot needs a better name something like  or something,1
34286,could use a better name ,1
34286,this could be turned into a method and thus be a lot smaller and easier on the eyes,1
34286,gotta find a way to not print out the cloning bit,1
34286,in the future this will be handled with  at which point we wont need the recursive mess wont even need this whole thing ,1
34286,consider starting with just  and adding more specific stuff like  and  after youve demonstrated an actual need,1
34254,outside of a bottom margin on entryutility they were styled identically  to target the former entryutility you could use  probably could go either way  but i thought it was redundant to have    separate classes  ,1
34309,could you please start each title with a capital letter and end with a full stop and empty roxygen line ,1
34309,can you please make sure you have a space after each comma  and around  ,1
34315,its better to use  here  so that the env vars are restored even if theres an error,0
34315,i think you should make the arguments match  exactly,1

34323,have we gained an extra  unnecessary level of indenting here ,1
34286,takes a  object and pulls updates dependencies other setup moving parts could also be shoved into this method,1
34325,we need to disable the cache while this runs  to avoid a nasty bug    also  we should resave them all after  to   be sure it fixed the bug   retrigger all the caching we didnt allow to happen,1
34286,what i need is a paper blog series whatever that talks about cpan  rubygems  npm  pip  and maven a lot of my foundation comes from having only really interacted as a publisher with rubygems,1
34326,the main suggestion i have for this code as it is now is for you to try and move this functionality down into and have assemble the data upon request from its child package objects  in the same way   that  d,1
34326,perhaps this is premature but id like to see this logic elsewhere  mainly because its confusing the role of  perhaps the object can do more of this,1
34326,as a side note  you mentioned in  about the use of  all over the place youll find that its main use is not to assign  but to curry additional arguments to functions that need to be passed around    so we dont end up with callbacks with,1
34323,to be honest  im still struggling a bit with enders code formatting conventions actually trying to reconstruct this for this post  i think that even one more level of indenting is need here    before,1
34328,im a little concerned by this its a big slowdown for proper databases  just to let test databases work better i wonder if theres a way we can catch this error for and fix it  or a databasespecific   switch pretty hacky  mind    alternative,1
34332,please add to all the locators names,1
34330,sorry for not having much of substance to add  but with this one  i think youve completed of possible indentations and spacing for if statements in a single file ,0
34323,oh  of course  because you added another function  yes it goes in yet another level when you have another child thats an annoying inconsistency that still remains in the code formatting  maybe well   decide to always indent at that level whether theres ,0
34330,  would look so much nicer  if you ask me,1
34330,in other repos languages we have the convention of always finish the file with a new line  in case you want to adopt it,1
34330,for my own edification sometimes what look to me like statements end in a semicolon  sometimes the dont is there any rationale ,1
34323,yes i absolutely second that sentiment will push a fix later today,0
34332,we should use pep  for imports here        imports should be grouped in the following order          standard library imports          related third party imports          local application library specif,1
34332,same thing with this imports as above,1
34332,we should give this method a more suggestive name  such as ,1
34332,we should use triple double quotes    for docstrings,1
34343,true but for me it makes the flow easier to follow,0
34352,that might make sense  sure  it wont be sourced unless that symlink is in place,0
34340,i was just guessing seems like node should have support for os independent paths by now,1
33972,hmm after adding the  wrapper were only left with a string giving users a dom tree to manipulate seems much more friendly than forcing them to deal with html source    ,1
34356,did you mean to use malcolmsparks as the groupid here ,1
33895,i just meant  as an empty object since on the next line the  is set i dont see it used in the tests  though sorry if i am missing something ,1

34330,same thing as with the previous result,1
33895,its code to reset an internal variable so  can work multiple times without being additive    i should submit a patch to cli though i think or a new function should do it shouldnt mess arround with the internals,1
33972,i thought you would have preferred just doing string replacements but  if its dom you want  this is good,1
34372,can we default valgrind to being on ,1

34257,richard     that may just be habit on my part in the top level makes it  ignore beams everywhere i can fix that and resubmit the pull request  if you like    eric  ,1
34408,these three lines could probably be replaced with  or similar,1
34407,do we want to log this  if its unlikely to happen maybe take out the try catch  if its likely to happen shouldnt we be able to see the error ,1
34412,please add the tags for proper javadoc formatting,1
34412,how do we deal with something like pig using several of these in one job  the class conf values will clash,1
34408,i considered that  but i wanted to leverage javascripts internal methods for capitalization due to edge cases with foreign alphabets      for example    its possible to make a regex that covers most of these cases  but i felt ,1
34408,was this removed or is the diff just weird haha,1
34420,add some spacing around the arg here  please,1
33935,if theres a value in the explicitness  i agree to me this is just extra chars though  everyone knows in python that return is none,1
34420,i think this might be redundant on   it attempts to use defaulticon  which is specified in the config and inserted into the page via butter added this ticket to help ,1
34423,removing call to  here because it is already called when the adjustment is created via an  call back in the adjustment,1
33935,sure is thanks,0
34423,i felt this test need to be rewritten to actually test against a real adjustment  but everything was so mocked out i wasnt sure how to best rewrite the test  opted to just prevent the test from breaking   instead,1
34001,removed  also added a comment indicating that empty value is equivalent to accept all,1
34412,it is formatted looks quite pretty  ,0
34437,id suggest,1
34437,might want to clarify which headers override which,1
34333,indeed  it surely is i wonder why the spec testing the oldstyle hashes didnt fail when i changed that ill push a fix back,1
34412,each pig loader would set the config appropriately in this current use case directly extends this class  so this conf is not used at all    the config limitation applies only to mr jobs if an mr job does need to use multiple i,1
34254,i think classes make sense when the styles are intended to be reused  or to continue your example  if you wanted to float the headers entrymeta  but not the footer youd do     anyway   i can agree to leave it as is  ,1
34428,i corrected this mistake in my project but not in repository  now it shoud be ok,0
34333,it seems that the  object is available once  is run ive tested this in irb on  and   and it seems to be the same in both that would explain why the spec testing the oldstyle hash isnt failing,1
33935,im cool  whatever works for you mate ,0
33951,ya figured that out but if we are not using it  then we should not have it in there so  please make those changes as well  either way is fine with me   using it or removing it ,0
34373,yes please just set the variable and grab the last item that way i know its silly  but i dont like the idea of adding an undocumented method just for this the rest of the pr is perfect ,0

34257,yeah  i prefer to put in the respective subdirectories as needed,0
34384,ok  i was not clear enough  sorry  in any case  there is no clear solution in sight  my only guess is that packaging should address some case considered to be most usual  like maybe python   and   not running mac os  for anything else  pymacs should b,0

34505,what about filtering by type  and  tag  ,1
34505,i would use to be sure not to overwrite some previous condition,1

33786,adding method  to determine how much to read when flushing the queue  now its possible to allocate enough buffer space to read the entire queue in  pass  ,1
33786,this method is not currently used  but maybe useful in the future to determine the number of events in the event queue  currently  all events are flushed,1
34507,you could sort and then take the highest value maybe something like        to see what this is doing  try a simple example    ,1
33786,only directories will be added to the inotify watch  it will be up to the client that calls to determine if the file directory that changed was the one of interest,1

34525,temporary doesnt need to be capitalized  right ,1
33786,yes  it is possible to miss changes that occur between calls to   this is the current behavior of   if there is no change and the timeout expires  then a file directory is changed between the subsequent   call to cf,0
34254,i saw that geek cred to you    but isnt the pull request simpler then  seems like it to me  if you write in your commit message somewhere  github will automagically close the issue for you very handy,0
34505,agreed is now part of the approach for the allowance of both tag and type,0
34254,well the pull request was saying the source was different now since the upstream master had been changed by merging in another of my pull requests  so it suggested this as an alternative method    it definitely was a pain doing it with the ,1
34505,does this method return a query builder   if yes  it should be renamed as it is rather confusing it has the same name than doctrines magical method returning an array,1
34542,should probably specify that  is for tcsh and export is for bash  and also say that people should add these lines to their or so they dont have to run them all the time,1
34542,might help to add  before this  and possibly add  before the svn co line,1
34505,i agree that is a legacy method that i did not dare touch without a thorough search,0
34507,oh right  i its   either way  thats active support magic that calls on each object in the array  then sorts by it,0
34544,ideally  id like to see this formatting  ,0
34505,this should be of type to be consistent,1
34505,searched code and renamed method,1
34544,this should be fixed now  i think,1
34544,lets break this function into multiple lines,1
34544,i think we decided on a fix  no ,1
34505,fixed in next push quotes are also removed for consistency,1
34507,sweet  thx that got it working ,0
34554,the value in the exception message should be received  not   another spot i missed when i converted to an array of chunks     i see  the  call still worked because it was always asking for more than remained ,1
34555,i believe the newly introduced newline production should be used here as it is used bellow in other places this form would not work on posix platforms where the    is normally not present in the text so the parser will reject the  source,1
34555,yes  this is imo the correct cross platform way,0
34556,wowthats so cool  i never thought of doing that,0
34556,you are right  we need to handle that ill search for a similar case in the codebase,0
34555,this changes the semantics a little bit and im not sure if it will not break something original version expects the pattern to end with    to support windows i think the re should be    or simply the parenthesis are not necessar,1
34556,this is a little goofy  but id put  here instead of  since thats definitely outside the boundary i cant tell if its possible for the timings to be such that theres an edge case where it ends up being   inside the boundary and shows up in the from,1
34555,all the three lines change semantic thats ok if necessary or if it improves something  which i dont know otherwise i would suggest to only prepend  before the    in the original version please comment,1
34555,those  lines above seems ok to me,0
34556,true  i dont want to add any test cases that fail randomly,0
34555,again  this is not only allowing    to precede     but it changes the semantics eg    accepts  one of     or     but i think the intent is actually   put together the correct re seems to me to be       which will perform as b,1
34569,this using statement got misplaced,1
34569,could replace  with either  or  the former would probably be more efficient  since the latter would be a single option character class,1
34570,for a comment like this that describes what the method does  go ahead and use a ,1
34570,i would call this parameter  since we dont know if its a shake id yet,1
34570,hmm  you might consider checking if the shake name is a number  and if it is assuming its an id so you can skip the extra api request looks like there are some shakes  such as  that are named with   numbers  but since you can ,1
34326,the information about how many indent characters are used will need to be available the  function in holds the information about how many characters the code will be indented should that be   changed to an exported global so we c,1
34570,i would go ahead and  here  so you can avoid the vaguely named  variable entirely,1
34570,i would call this  both to be a little clearer what it does with sharedfiles  and in case we need to add a  command later somewhy    then it would be clear enough to omit the descriptive comment above too    hmm  you might,1
34570,when interpolating one thing into a string  the parentheses arent necessary  so i omit them i would write that     you might be interested to know you have to include a comma to make a singleentry tuple  so it evaluates as ,1
34570,could you change the  description to describe the  command here ,1
34570,i would call this parameter  in which case the  description would be something like the api endpoint to call,1
34570,as for the  command  these help descriptions should include a verb just adding list the to all of them as in s would be great,1
34570,since this can be a name too  i would call this argument simply   and describe it as id or url name of the shake to list,1
34570,the method name  is pretty clear  so i would omit this comment,1
34570,could you add the spaces around the  in this assignment ,1
34570,the  interpolation operator wants for some spaces too as above  since theres only one thing interpolated  i would write it ,1
34570,as above  id omit this comment,1
34583,this can be dryer  like doing a for on this methods,1
34583,how about a max length validation on the model for the title   just a question,1

34589,reordered operations to overcome issue with out of bounds same change in  places,1
34586,sure i wrote it that way as i had in mind to add a class for deprecated vars  so they could be visually distinguished,0
34592,do you happen to have json with this in it   sorry if i missed it,1
34403,i have completely forgotten about   its better,0
34403,if t is nested struct   occurs an error  in addition  if t has   we can bypass it,1
34593,which documents should be applied is a correct from i think,1
34593,could you write utility function like   instead  that way you wont need to beak and it would by way easier to follow it took me a while to figure out what was going on here,1
34372,should this return after  ,1
34593,please add a space before ,1
34372,think this comment is out of date,1
34326,well this is another reason that putting some of the dirty source map logic into makes sense  because so much of what it needs to know is in there  including the indent character count  asks all its s   for s,1
34593,i would very much prefer to have more utility functions than this complex iterator for example we already have utility function for getting window tabs    i think,1
34372,do we need to keep track of  at all   since were walking from the front back cant we just keep a  of how many weve popped     also  in the same walk of the list  once  is  we can exit the loop  allowing us to just write out what,1
34372,would be helpful if we turned the above  lines into a little new helper function to be used here and internally by ,1
34605,please put these back in the  function  for now,1
34570,i like this this suggestion and if you are ok with my previous comment  will return the value of the argument after the for loop no names matched,1
34570,my thought here was this  if the shake argument matches a shake name even if its numeric  it should be converted to that shake   if it cannot be resolved as a known name  then assume its a shake   id and proceed  the error handling of handling it as a sh,1
34603,one thing that would be cool is if we could specify the maximum number of characters in the text output so if we said   then the code would automatically wordwrap everything to  characters   when generating text output otherwise the text,1
34570,nice attention to detail there  thanks for the tip on the      i was curious about the apparent ambiguity,0
34603,so  we have contact information and education what about job experience  etc  maybe add those to the input json file  and incorporate those in the plain text output ,1
34570,nice style   i was also trying to mimc the wording of the api docs did you help write those ,0
34570,works for me  i wasnt sure if preserve the original order of keys and whether that would be useful or not,0
34570,i like switching to shake in this situation,0
34570,missed that one  sure thing,1
34570,yup  easier to let the code speak for itself,0
34570,i ran into a problem with using an optional argument   it could have been a bug in my original implementation  ill revisit that in a subsequent commit,1
34614,good job actually cleaning up the discussion here  we also need to clean up choices and votes however  we could probably take care of all of these with attributes on the models,0
34614,um  where did this whole file go  you were probably trying to keep top secret stuff out of the public repo  which is a good goal however  i think we should talk about the best way to do that,1
34614,yeah  im not sure what was going on there,1
34614,so this is actually in the   but for some reason it wasnt being ignored,0
34614,that is how you do block comments in coffeescript,1
34614,ah  i think youre right i think i added it to the   but then never actually git rmd the file this is probably fine then  since there are the and files still in the repo for examples,0
34570,when with for added clarity and to disambiguate from temporary for shake in shakes,1
34614,yeah  i need to clean up some of the unused code  sorry ,0
34614,yeah  i was looking into that  im a little rusty on rails  so this was an easy way to get it done  ,0
34614,ahhhh makes sense when i actually preview the file you can just get rid of the unused code no need to keep it around in block comments,0
34542,in this sort of documentation  it is always good to reference directories with the environment variable previously defined  ie  ,1
34614,no worries  good job cleaning up some of our mess  haha,0

33986,is this name correct  we do not have a proxy here  do we ,1
33986,indeed  it is not for proxies but for entities or documents once the implementation is switched to the common interfaces for sf ,1
34700,well  i just needed a token to send around  and protobuf does not really have this feature  so i thought a string is extensible at the same time ie containing what it was that is done now  should that   become necessary,1
34700,okay  will put all of this into a new subproject,1
34700,should include what happens if theres an exception thrown,0
34497,you are right  ill fix it asap  thanks ,0
34700,i left that change for another day,1
34700,of course that reasoning required some sprinkling around of  and friends,1
34700,should this be public ,1
34700,is this public api ,1
34628,because bottom imports are evil they make a complete mess of the import graph  making it very painful to resolve import loops and they go against all pythonic conventions,1
34628,that was an automated change  so i didnt attempt to fix any problem besides indentation,1
33845,it still returns false you need to somehow mark it to be added to ill add more precise javadoc    no doubts about the rest of suggestions,1
34332,we should add after the name,1
34716,this should be public  right ,1
34332,we should add  after the name this also applies to the below names,1
34435,could be but that means patching ,1
34700,public api  seems like an utility method that should go somewhere ,1
34700,alright  finished review docs etc is needed ,1
34726,were calling twice  once here and once right after this method returns  can you remove that duplication ,1
34727,the x is in here to force css float clearing would a period  fix the screen reader problem  thanks for reporting this,1
32896,ill fix this small typo when i merge it in,1
34686,reverted same for the above one,1
34218,i made this change  its much prettier updated the pull request,1
34372,oops nice catch this diff is getting a bit long eh,0
34403,i understood the reason  however  there is two points of anxiety  the first point is performance because memory copying occurs  the method to initialize with is slower than explicit noninitializing about the execution speed this is a very slig,0
34733,can we change this to    and have have another function      if you would ,1
34372,pop can start at an arbitrary position  as requested by this issue  thats why we need to keep track of current position while walking through    thats also the reason why we might need to reconstitute in the general case  where we removed something f,1
34335,the thing is head should be implemented for anything thats a get request or were in violation of the spec  but if this isnt exposed as  get request then there cannot be head,1
34727, would be sufficient,0
34641,youre right its a fourth value i have hideously embarrassed myself by getting it backwards,0
33895,that would be cool although it seems pretty solid as well your call although  perhaps in a separate pull request if you want  so this can get in  ,0
34251,i see now that code we added elsewhere does use  so yes  we should have used that here  too  thanks for spotting this,1
34652,agree wrote that in haste to get it working and didnt think to extract done  new pr incoming,0
33895,yea id merge as is everything else can be added later,0
34748,grammar nazi returns a list of regions at the specified location if regions are found  an array of region names are returned  otherwise  an empty array is returned,1
34251,during development we encountered that function elsewhere and it looked like something we ought to use  but we arent entirely sure if its the right thing to do  some advice would be good  if you   arent sure either  id say the comment is spurious as ,1
34756,theres a lot of whitespaceonly noise in this pull can you leave the whitespace alone     if you really care about it  send a separate pull with the formatting fixups on their own  after all of this is merged or rejected for reals,1
34756,can this be a normal keyword argument with a default value  instead of dictionary fishing     come to think of it  what does ssl have to do with supporting file upload api endpoints  can this be a separate pull request ,1
34756,using different guessthemimetype approaches depending on whether the resource has a name or not seems like it would lead to surprises are you sure that mimetypes cant interrogate a stream    so as to at least use a subset of the same logic in the strea,1
34756,surely theres a library for this,0
34251,youre duplicating core httpd functionality now using  here is the right thing,1
34756,the same remark from about randomly rearranging symbols applies to this encoder decoder pair,1
34756,this could use some elaboration of the expected xml and http entity  maybe  you can infer it from the test  but its not very clear if youre not already intimately familiar with refreshbooks request  concocting magic,1
10152,d    gotta keep it light haha,0
34723,allright  will do  thanks for the feedback,0
34756,please keep files empty can this go into a separate module within the package  nonempty package init leads to some unnecessarilyconfusing behaviour around package and module initialization   its harmless  bu,1
10152,you could do this in this case  a simple way to see what this is doing  or  now that i think about i,1
34756,id like to introduce you to  ,1
34756,does this behave itself properly with multiline headers  what does do with them ,1
34756,named nonoptional positional arguments  again,1
34251,comments and more tests added,1
34251,can you help me understand what i need to replace   the docs on that function are pretty opaque and its implementation is just an indirection layer  so its not clear to me what  precisely  is being   duplicated,1
34641,im sure youll recover somehow ,1
34403,i expected such a redundant implemented code  too when you accept my claim  it will be difficult to avoid it thank you for your work ,1
34758,this is fine  i mostly had this in as a placeholder,0
34758,probably want to make sure this is sanitized,1
34758,it would be nice if were a bit more verbose of a method name,1
34765,seems like you should be able to combine this and line  into a simple jquery selector,1
34768,this comment should really be a comment introducing the method plus add yuidoc tags,1
10152,nice  i knew there had to be a better way thats awesome array support d    just looked up shuffle basically it shuffles and since there are only two it would be them in  and  if there were  in the array  would it throw an error or just stuff ,0
34769,is a  necessary here  i think  will be enough wdyt ,1
34769,mmmmmmmmmm im not sure exactly  is nice because were essentially calling context on a list  and so we get the list back,1
10152,love it ,0
34770,see staging rakefile for example    ,1
34777,talked to avi  we can restructure this if we ever get to the point where attributes are going to have fields that variants dont,1
34758,we should have a helper function for determining whether guest authors is enabled noting to update later,1
34756,there is  its even builtin ,1
34769,ya i liked  in this context since its working with a list but  would work too ,0
34780,i am curious whether we could make this less antisocial consider folks who have provided their own overrides  or folks debugging node core good enough for now though ,1
34780,i should try this in a browser too i bet i want to filter out native code or something like that,1
34781,probably should use the domready test from the tests and use  or something instead of php ,1
34781,please add newlines at the end of the files d,1
34781,youre mixing spaces and tabs in this file probably convert everything to  spaces for consistency,1
34781,thats probably my fault btw ,0
34461,the  indentation of the file is correct we think this is related to github indentation algorithm error,1
34758,yes is the default for new posts  which already have an id and a i tested turning off and on as well,1
34782,i had to run the tmvc t template again and it cleared out these extra spaces theres a bunch of these  i suggest skimming past them ,1
34461, and  in kfold crossvalidation  we just create one monitor this monitor monitors each fold distinctly and if we dont reset the monitor  we get wrong total number of batches we want to see only   the number of batches for one fold     it will more,1
34783,is statics last a spring convention  my ctrlshifto puts them at the top,1
34783,lets do this can you reorganize them with your settings and send me via email your order of imports and ill adjust for future,1
34085,currently kernels do need to associated with a notebook  we could relax that assumption  but i think it is a separate issue,1
34784,a vector is not necessary please remove it    this code converts the data twice first  the incoming string is converted to a which only requires a   btw  and then the vector is converted to json format please update code to conv,1
34781,i passed all the files with the autoindent of my editor webstorm probably missed the html one  ill check,1
34781,yep  thats probably the best things to do also to check load domready order,0
34461,we will change it for a raise instead of a warning,1
34787,i started down that path but migration manager flagged that things like and unapply would no longer be compatible i dont think any client  code should be doing that  but who knows should i go ahead and ignore  those     thanks  srp,1
34681,yes  that assertion was also in the and and i was making them match if it needs to be removed then ill remove it from all three,0
34768,today  with mustache  we can add  and call for to get the stringify version of the template  and pass it to the client side if we want to use that there    with handlebars  we should be able to do the exac,1
34785,if you want to get the original class name  you should probably use,1
34768,agreed  i will adjust it,0
34085,i thought this pr was resolving the issue of cells being coupled with execution requests  now  you dont need a cell to execute some code and get a result,1
34789,we can just remove these no need for commented out code here,1
34628,yes  thats exactly what they are,0
34787,i tried the following  but the compi,1
34085,this pr is meant to decouple the code cell  kernel  and notebook objects in javascript  it doesnt change the weak coupling in the notebook server though  that is a separate issue  ,1
34085,the general goal is to resolve the unnecessary coupling of kernels  notebooks  and cells  part of that is using the kernel  alone  no notebook  no cells as a javascript library for remote execution    i should note that i did a test  and it does seem ,1
34542,i think putting in angle brackets it just going to confuse people  whats that supposed to mean ,1
34085,if i understand things correctly  decoupling the notebook and kernel is effectively what we did with the sage cell server any webpage can embed a single cell and execute code as part of that single   cell  and in fact  any webpage can just call the,0
34542,if you use c shell or tcsh you can,1
