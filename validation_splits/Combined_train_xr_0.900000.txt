I don't care what we do as long as we don't change the attributes in JSP significantly.
You are right. See my update! Make a suggestion pls and I'll catch your thoughts ;)
+1 for *"...the debate was about **what** was actually meta data."*
Have you actually implemented this successfully? It sounds like a great solution!
Excellent point, Lars. I read that as "Windows". Oops. Still, it may be useful information for someone, sometime...
Great question!
I'm not for sure how the ControlCollection of ASP.Net works, so maybe someone can shed some light on this for me. I recently discovered the magic that is extension methods and Linq. Well, I was very sad to find that this isn't valid syntax However from what I can tell, does implement the interface which provides such methods, so what gives? Why doesn't that just work? I have found a decent work around for this issue at least:
Sorry to nag.
Excellent question. Running a large project in successive version of Python wouldn't be very definitive, unless you had, say, unit tests that magically achieved 100% code coverage, so a tool like this would be nice to have.
It is a core class, why should it be independent from core usage? "If you just assign an end date you have to jump in the source code to become an idea how the start date is resolved." This can be written into the function comment, so if we may change $GLOBALS['EXEC_TIME'] we do not need to change so much calls.
Excellent! On a Mac as well... I'll look into railsapi.com. Thank you for your help!
Great! Awesome! thanks Dims
That's funny, this is exactly what I am attempting to figure out the best way to do at the moment. I had thought of using a ViewStack, but as I already have a lot of other nested ViewStacks being used, I was also looking into the State tag. If anyone knows "the right thing" to do I'll be very interested too!
Sorry to nag.
Instead of having "%s" of "%s" I'm thinking it should be "%s" belonging to "%s" I feel that both "Page 1 belonging to Group 1" and "Page A belonging to Robert Lyon" make more sense than "Page 1 of Group 1" and "Page A of Robert Lyon"
Marked up the question, while I don't think it's a great idea, I think its a good question to ask!
It adds more things to go wrong than just downloading everything again to do a reinstall. I understand the desire, downloads are a pain, but downloading again is a much more predictable zero state than some set of possibly-correct archives on local disk checked against some possibly-correct set of hashes. All of which is a lot of extra moving parts to work around a problem (slow connections). Is it worth it? Maybe. But it is a lot more to go wrong.
But definitely agree that in 99% of cases office interop is horrible.
Excellent! On a Mac as well... I'll look into railsapi.com. Thank you for your help!
+1 Serapth - I hate this. I **HATE** it!
The problem is that it builds awt and that requires some dependencies.
Sorry I was trying to get to the wiki but it's been a busy week.
who the fuck is asking for scores but not the max score and why does their insanely specialized use case justify all these booleans on a central lucene class.
very nice beautiful :-)
Element. This one stuck out. I think the only ones to try to capitalize are "Allocation, Type, Element", since that trio is the dominant set of APIs for interacting with any sort of data from Java.
We probably want tvb_reported_length_remaining() here
Instead of putting everything in the collector and then looping through later when outputFormat==JSON why not switch here on outputFormat and thus allow results to be printed immediately for JSON and collected only for JSON_SINGLE?
Damn.
The is an excellent resource for locale data. From the website you can download an xml version of the database, which includes datetime formats, number formats, and lots of other locale specific data.
Excellent article! Very useful :)
Since BE was IE10 (as of the member var above) I think changing the member to edge is not a problem, but I would keep the IE8 default here, which does not hurt us, and will also not hurt third party stuff then.
For someone who uses the Ctrl-W bindings in vim habitually, it is incredibly annoying to have Chrome OS ask me, "Wanna close this window, then?" How do I remap keys in Chrome OS? Can't find this top secret setting anywhere.
Great, excellent. You're welcome!
Please don't. See my comment in utils.py. Configure the logger with proper formatter instead.
Tried it, loved it. Using it right now.
I guess the big question is whether it is sufficient to test the functionality by mocking out getaddrinfo() or if we need to actually make the call. If the former, I think it could go in UT. Lets see what others' say.
Why are you using cerr here instead of vtkErrorMacro?
The Async API in http client 4.x really sucks.
I'm an idiot... there's nothing wrong with the readme.txt.
There is no putComment method. Shorten this and just put it on one line: checkState(psId != null, "setPatchSetId must be called first"); Developers debugging a failure can look at the Java stack trace to see how they got into this situation. What matters to them more is the call site where the object was misused, not which entry point into the object the error was discovered by.
Just curious, how come you use a RandomAccessFile here? It might be simpler to just Guava (which lint already depends on): String firstLine = Files.readFirstLine(file, Charsets.US_ASCII); (that's com.google.common.io.Files)
Shameeeee on me!!!
I wonder why jetbrains repeats this code in all their bundles.
Bejesuz that's ugly! Whomever wrote that should be flogged.
There is reference information available on the MSDN website. If you want more of an introduction or tutorial, then Charles Petzold's book is excellent.
I think I've been using these terms interchangably / wrongly!
I did a lot of VRML+Java work in college and loved it, but I feel like it's not really a marketable skill. Has anyone worked with a high level graphics API like open inventor, coin..etc that is actually in use to a degree that makes investing a lot of time in the API worthwhile for something more than a hobby?
Again, no new abstract functions in the API classes, please.
unused parameter 'p_info' [-Werror=unused-parameter] (p_info ? -> pinfo ?)
@Evan It's not compilable java. It's used to navigate the code in eclipse/idea and is excellent if you have a large code base with lots of long class names.
This is great! Thanks +1
Horrible answer because it is just wrong.
I didn't know we needed to retain backwards config capability across 3.x to 4.x :-( That sucks and it'll make old code stick around longer.
Sorry ;-) +1
Reinnstalled Xcode4 - same thing. Awful!
We take an "error_list" from the framework here, but "message" is passed as an argument. Looking at how message is constructed, this also could be generated here (there is no need to pass it through argument). So either both message and error_list are this function arguments, or none of them.
such a strong argument without any "reference", is completely useless because just opinionated.
But you are already the NAT gateway (in 1) so no one else should be using gateway address? Anyway I'm fine with -3 : please just add a comment to explain why it's -3 :)
This is a professional project in academia and I need to use Java for it - bc of my own limitations I'm afraid!
Thanks, everyone! I learned something extremely valuable :D So Linux doesn't stop at the 26th value?
I find it comes back periodically. What's most frustrating about it is that everytime it does come back, it breaks WebDeploy as the account under which that runs does not have access to delete the aspnet_client folder created!

You can open as many issue tickets as you like. But we would still have to add all these tests in here, and find solution that fit them. Why delay?
Hi I'm using the chrome inspector (F12) to try and analyze the z-index of a twitter bootstrap popover, and finding it extremely frustrating... Is there a way to freeze the popover (while shown) so that I can assess and modify the associated CSS? Placing a fixed 'hover' on the associated link does not cause the popover to appear.
Sorry if this spam's things however it's unlikely that I'll work on these.
yeah, your pain is mine! This method described by ctrahey at least gives you some clue.
I found the answer! It appears to be an issue with sending to the development device tokens. Like most people, we have a database that stores the device tokens, and the earlier records were populated with our device tokens from testing. As soon as I net out those device tokens from my list, all works! I really hope someone finds this useful!
I have 2 images inside a folder called Pics..... Image1.jpg and Image2.jpg. What code must i place inside my Submit button to just delete Image1.jpg located here "~/Pics/Image1.jpg" Any help would be great!!!
This is horrible. First you're sleeping, which will never wait exactly the right amount of time. It may fail if the computer is busy and shutdown takes longer than expected. And otherwise it will waste time. Furthermore, you're using shared *persistent* state. The right solution is simply to free the `runOnce` mutex before calling `Application.Restart()`.
Perhaps I am missing something, but I am just learning javascript. My understanding of Single Origin Policy is that Google Analytics should not be able to send data back to Google. How is it able to transmit send data to Google without violating the policy?
For some reason I couldn't upload the straight patch.
Excellent! It works like this: [code]extern "C" {
It's not a place, but I've found by Charles Petzold excellent. It covers everything you ask about and is focused specifically on WPF/silverlight. Of course Petzold (as usual) is able to communicate the important concepts beautifully.
So to do this I would keep a list of axes and when I delete the contents of one I would swap it out with a full one. I think the example below solved the problem (or at least gives an idea of how to solve it): The extremely ugly for loop construct is really just a placeholder to give an example of how the axes can be swapped.
Entering an invalid object size limit results in displaying an 'Internal Server Error'. If possible it should display a proper error message, saying that the limit is invalid.
I'm sorry, but I didn't had an eye on this thread. I'm afraid the topic isn't hot anymore!?
In the latest patch, you switched from glib memory to wmem memory. So you do not want to call g_free but you still want to destroy the hash table itself, otherwise you are leaking memory. So switch to g_hash_table_new instead of g_hash_table_new_full and put back the call to g_hash_table_destroy.
I'm not sure what the problem is but the behavior (at least in 0.1.4) is that the _isClosed AtomicBoolean is not being set to closed in a timely manner.
I'm trying to get multiple rails apps hosted under the same domain, but different directories. My configuration before attempting to host multiple apps (which works great), looks like this: I google'd around and found documentation suggesting I use the following configuration: That configuration, however, only causes my directory structure to be revealed, and no app appears to run. Any advice would be great!
Especially I don't know very much about the test framework differences.
FlexMonkey may be more of a pain than it is worth. Gorrilla Logic claims it works with custom components but I have found this is not the case. Anything with a renderer seems to have serious problems. It is a lot harder to set up tests than they claim and the tests aren't stable. I have written tests for one component 5 times now using hardcoded ids. Sometimes it just can't see the component and it dies. They only have 3 short paragraphs explaining tests in their user guide and they only respond to questions about how to set it up on their google group. I would avoid using this.
who uses this method ? I don't see why this is useful. I'd just get rid of this method and the associated field. Once you do that, you can just collapse this class into a single static method (runAll) and get rid of the Pair class.
not sure how important this is, but other lines seem to have a tab at the beginning of the line and the added lines uses spaces. :D
Cool, that was going to be my next suggestion! Good luck :)
I have a long scrolling page, and want to test if an element is 100px from the top, then apply a class elsewhere (until the next element in line is 100px from the top) If I could just get the basic statement I would be ecstatic, anything extra would be a bonus!
Excellent, exactly what I needed!
Thanks Ilya.
Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this Please fix the indent pep8 errors in gluster_cli_tests.py at least.
I don't see where we append the rewinded header to the database file. Otherwise, when we open the db file next time, it will still give us the latest header that is not rollbacked.
I really hate when this happens.. I search and search for an answer and then I post a question. Then minutes later I find the answer.. The answer was on line 5.. this let me make the call.. I mean I get a pile of junk on the screen, but it doesn't fail... no exception.
When I click on Memcache Viewer the whole dashboard crashes and I have to login again. This is really worrying me as we are serving data to many users. A server error has occurred. Is there a way to see the internal logs? I can't see anything in nor . Is there any other way to reset the Memcache?
Per our discussion, make this a class that's just the combobox? Maybe like AndroidApiCombo?
They're not, and can't be. Same as with proto fields that this code is a copy of... and quite a few other pre-existing Lua code spots too for that matter.
I am trying to make Authlogic and Facebook Connect (using Facebook) play nice so that you can create an account either the normal registration way or with Facebook connect. I have been able to get the connect to work one way but logging out only loggs out on facebook and not on my site, I have to delete the cookies to make it working. Any help would be awesome, thank you!
Damn I would close this out from the fix to JBSEAM-3742 except the quartz and seampay examples use a custom XML namespace and the XML schema validator is not happy with that.
upvoted scared the hell out of me when things stopped working!!
@Kev its a deployment headache, you can ilmerge it in ... but still its an extra bit of luggage you need to worry about
If you are concerned about code re-ordering you are either creating some funky and hard to understand and maintain code, or else you probably don't need to worry about it. Can you explain why you think the code snippet you supplied will be reordered?
Mac looks like the tests are failing (especially TestHarFileSystem).
I'm working with a console application (C#) at the moment. What it does is pulls files from a database and stores them in their relevant folders on the C drive on a local machine. At the moment, every time I run the console app, it pulls ALL the files from the database. What I would like to be able to do, is each time I run it, It only pulls the files that were submitted since I last ran the console application. Currently, this is the linq statement that pulls the files from the database. Ideally I'd like something like the following where the date and time of the last run of the application is stored somewhere: I'm unsure on how to go about achieving this. If anyone had any advice on it I'd be very greatful :)
Because they need some more tweaking to supports booth modes: standalone and in tree?

The 0x1A byte is a terrible, painful [source of agony](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12483711/serialdata-eof-circumstances).
that was from something else - that apparently the fragmentmanager holds on to fragments. But you're right - it doesn't make any difference one way or the other. Nice library by the way - extremely useful!
Ran into this myself. Very annoying limitation IMO.
Sorry this affects 0.9.3 version too.
Use if-else inside scriplet based on the currently selected language and place appropriate "td" tags. Hope this is what you are looking for !
Since ChangeSets are becoming too many to handle because of many checkins, I'm thinking of selecting multiple changesets then create a single work item link for code review purposes. It's really painful to create work item per changeset and assign to a code-reviewer. Is this possible?
The general way to do this is $(TOP)/src/southbridge etc. etc.
I don't think that you can... But if you can I'd love to see how!
If you don't mind working at a slightly lower level, httplib2 () is an excellent HTTP library that includes caching functionality.
Sorry about that...
this is a problem that regularly arises when I write Silverlight XAML. In this case, I've made a usercontrol VerticalTabStop (code attached) that has a ToolTip attached. I instanciate a couple of my usercontrols, and then I get the debugging window and the following error: I get an awful lot of these messages as I hover my mouse over the buttons. Any suggestions to what I'm doing wrong here? Cheers
Don't set the `idx_type` for now, as it may also contain internal errors (I would leave the code path in couchdb for dealing with it though, so that I can add it later.
That irritated the hell out of me too but I didn't realise it was configurable in the .launch file.

Good Morning, I'm using SharePoint Designer 2007 to create a workflow for a MOSS site I have created. What I'm looking to do is have the workflow send out an email if a document in the library hasn't been modified for the past 30 days (and it's Status field is not set as "Closed"), but I'm stumped as to how I can do this. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
I'm nearly reaching rage mode! Can anyone help me with this?? I setted a limit on a CodeIgniter Model so I can only that set of results. Why is it not working? The records are displaying correctly on function call, but I'm getting more than how it's supposed to
Will we miss adding the server if the status change command failed on it? I guess we should add it if it fails with "already enabled" error. Not sure what we should do if there is some other error though. Maybe we should let the sync job handle such cases.
You are messing down deep below hbase in dfs.
Not sure if this is by design, but for now, from within Python causes a javascript exception to be raised and displayed (along with line and column numbers). Great success!
Sorry folks the full fix was committed in rather a messy manner due to some platform specific issues.
Ai, we missed a use-case here. I'm affraid that I know why this wasn't implemented yet. This doesn't check if the files inside the deleted folder have active references like is done above. See also https://review.typo3.org/#/c/33562/
Line lengths, seems like most of these would be easier to read if they were placed on the preceding line before the variables.
Not sure if this is by design, but for now, from within Python causes a javascript exception to be raised and displayed (along with line and column numbers). Great success!
Agreed. Unfortunately board-specific modifications to agesawrapper.c files have leaked in, making this a long boring process..

This code is broken. $this->storage needs to be changed
That's right, I have no plans to replace the existing system, sidecar is an excellent analogy.
It's HORRIBLE! No, seriously, I don't like it.
That is intended. We are already making sure that multiple events are okay for us (see onHashChanged). So I think this is the most practical way.
Awesome discussion.
If you know of a way please describe it.
@ergosys Thanks that was extremely helpful!! Somewhat related to what I asked... I'll have a try on that tomorrow :D
It's technically possible to achieve this in T-SQL with nested loops and embedded queries. All hugely ugly in T-SQL. Far easier to do it in a language that's more general purpose.
Sorry it seems I forgot a few references to 2.0.2 in ./deps/cxf-all I'm attaching a new patch to fix these references.
title.getPrefixedDb() gives the target article title, but in the apply() function it's looked up by href, which may be a redirect title.

i have an assignment at my company to build a custom cms, for the foundation i ve chosen latest laravel(version 4, i believe). Now, the requirements in laravel docs() say minimal version of php on server required is 5.3.7, our servers have php 5.3.23. I am right now on a weekend, so i cant check my code on the server( been developing the basics on localhost with xampp which has latest php). Has anyone tried laravel 4 on pre-5.3.7 php?? i m very worried all of last week's work is going to the bin... :(

The function is extremely annoying because it uses a prototype or something insane like that. You'd have to do an ampersand-call to override the prototype: .However, you are trying to transpose the matrix, not to it (which would produce a continuous list like We could use an iterator in conjunction with : which works, but this is severely overthinking the problem. Let's just swap indices:

I have discovered a mode in , where I can instantly change all same variables. When I am in this mode I get a box around the same variables and I can change one and instantly all others change. I do not know how to enter this mode "by will", I just entered it "randomly". Therefore, I really appreciate your suggestions, how to enter this mode, because it is extremely useful to me! PS.: I am using NO plugins, just a plain new eclipse installation with java!
Cosmetic: According to last changes related to tvb_captured_length and tvb_reported_length it is good point to start thinking about "reported" case (btsnoop format provide both frame length). In "reported" case we can have only part of frame: for example first 2 bytes. This dissector will fail at this line, so nothing will be dissected, but if you move lines 131-140,(169)171-181 directly before place when it will be use then we can dissect some fields. "context" can be filled somewhere about line current 202, "rf_channel" can be put between lines 144-145, "aa_offenses" can be fetch after 170 or where "context" is filled, the problem is "flags", but after moved it after line 147 you are able to decode "btle_rf_channel" field etc.
Yep, StackOverflow is written in C#/ .NET and is a very successful example of a high-scale site.

Hi there, I just moved from C#/C++ to JavaScript last night, and am loving it! I've just come across some behavior that I don't understand, wondering if anyone can shed some light on it?

Hi Derick - right now, I'm running from the command line, and very soon we'll have it hooked up to hudson. We've convinced people that hudson will be fine without a physical log file from the rake execution. And I think I've satiated the desire for log files by using the ".parameters" option on my msbuild and nunit tasks to log output. I'm LOVING albacore! You guys did a great job with it.
Why on my "git push" command I get the following very scaring error message? I've appended the text as it appeared on my shell, the strange symbols are shown. Is my Git installation broken? My fist git clone was using https I'm using on Ubuntu 10.10 x86_64
yes it does it in IE8 as well. Very annoying !
I have an existing javascript/flash -interaction kludge that sucks terribly. Now I've decided it'd be better to write a flash app that does the specific thing without the need to interact with javascript. Therefore I'd need to produce flash apps in linux, and I don't have money to throw at adobe right now (perhaps never if their software keeps being terrible). Also not going to do software development on windows, have been there, conclusion: that's not going to work well ever. So, any solutions? Free or open source?

Enable the deprecation log here is not finally discussed. I'm 60/40 for not logging, because the deprecation log will get extremely flooded. When enabling, only the first setting (and not all three) should be logged to minimize the flood. The logging could be enabled in the next version, and till then it should be documented very well.

I don't think we should let people modify a branch that they don't have access to, even if it is for a commit that they are replacing that used to be in another branch. Locked down is locked down, right? I see how it might be annoying to have to redo a change if you used the wrong branch the first time, though... Perhaps there is some Git magic that can let you do that painlessly?
Managing url paths can be a real pain in ASP.NET. AbsolutePath vs RelativePath vs etc. drives me crazy. I find that many solutions require the user to edit web.config element to include the correct subfolder path; ex. Website Root: Web.config setting: / Website Root: web.config setting: /blog/ Is there a way to properly handle this without having to make changes to the web.config?
Oh, man, I am sorry but I must say it: your code is really awful... It is not organised at all, but maybe... shouldn't be instead? EDIT: try to comment the second and third queries, since they seem useless, and make the "cur" -> "cursor" change I suggested:
Better would be to have if (nGlobalError) { PushError( nGlobalError); return; } if (aInputString.isEmpty()) { if (GetGlobalConfig().mbEmptyStringAsZero) PushDouble(0); else PushNoValue(); return; }

Well I'm kind of new with magento, and at work they ask me to do a group of products that they will be put in discount, so I created a category sales where I can link the products and put them in sale, so this is working perfectly, but the ask me to put dates in the products so the web master can put dates where the products will be shown between dates, so now I have no idea how to do this. I really hope you guys can help me thanks so much!
That sounds like some serious buck passing.
Excellent, thank you for sharing this!
These two variables were defined separately in the previous version. Now that you need them in every method, you could just declare them at the first utilization (applies to the other methods too).

The other day I noticed that if I run IEInspector's HttpAnalyser and capture the post data when logging into my bank account or amazon account the post data shows my user name and password in the clear. This is a little concerning. Does anyone know at what point the SSL encryption takes place? This I assume would mean that any software that is installed on your machine could potentially get access to this post data. Very scary.
Change looks fine, but please fix up this bad rebase.
The other day I noticed that if I run IEInspector's HttpAnalyser and capture the post data when logging into my bank account or amazon account the post data shows my user name and password in the clear. This is a little concerning. Does anyone know at what point the SSL encryption takes place? This I assume would mean that any software that is installed on your machine could potentially get access to this post data. Very scary.
Welcome :) :) :)
I have an .ico file with 5 icon sizes embedded in it being used as the main application icon and the System Tray icon. When it shows up in the task bar the icon is using the 16x16 format which is desired. When the icon shows up in the Notification Area/System tray, it is using the 32x32 format and Windows is rendering it down to a 16x16 icon, which looks horrible. How do I force windows to use the 16x16 icon size in the notification area? Here's my code to put the icon in the system tray:
Then you're pretty well screwed.
Wow, great site, and people I got in an answer in less then 5 minutes! Thanks SLaks!
Excellent explanation! +1 for you Sir
sorry unassigning myself from this backport.
Because of presence of data-parsoid, this is not a new block level image. Title or test needs editing.
instead of this simply add "creation_date_time=creation_date_time" to __init__ method bellow
I've just checked that simply adding the font to the VS project's Fonts Folder is enough and was worried that I'd have to manually make these calls. Fortunately, the VS project has a Register = vsdrfFont property, so I'm going to assume that the installer does this automatically.
Rename objectCollapsibleButton to objectCollapsibleBox or objectCollapsibleGroupBox ?
Sorry I didn't use your patch but I think you'll like the end result.
sorry this bug is *not* fixed.
line wrap before throws so the line isn't over 80 columns
Prefer ordered includes, i.e. VTK headers, vtksys headers, STL/system headers.
Sorry for the super-slow uptake on this the new job is using up all of my limited brain resources.
The above code from 2008101602 is present in the 1.1.0RC2_RELEASE so therefore existed before the 1.1.0_RELEASE so needs to be removed.
Please remove this log, it's a part of the if below
I guess the big question is whether it is sufficient to test the functionality by mocking out getaddrinfo() or if we need to actually make the call. If the former, I think it could go in UT. Lets see what others' say.
In ASP.NET MVC, I have a form. In this form the user selects a country, and then the ID is posted back to the server, using a normal . However, for some UX reasons, I use Knockout. Therefore I need to get my observable value to have the value of a dropdownlist. I want my label in the markup, to show the countryId, depending on the selected value on the dropdownlist. Markup: ViewModel: Then my question is: How do I modify my DropDownListFor, so the countryId is being set automatically? :-) Thanks a lot! I really enjoy learning Knockout, but this one has taken me a long time!
this is a problem that regularly arises when I write Silverlight XAML. In this case, I've made a usercontrol VerticalTabStop (code attached) that has a ToolTip attached. I instanciate a couple of my usercontrols, and then I get the debugging window and the following error: I get an awful lot of these messages as I hover my mouse over the buttons. Any suggestions to what I'm doing wrong here? Cheers
I did not make comments on all of these before because it was the same comment every time. Unless there is a good documented reason, these should all be set to ignore.
great question!
+1, Excellent explanation!
After seeing this live on gerrit-review, I think this is noisy. Every change seems to have 10+ conflicting changes, which I think is just an artifact of there being lots of old, unlikely-to-merge but still open changes in the project. I would prefer something like including "-age:30d" and/or "limit:5" with a link to the full search without that restriction.
@Alex: Great :) Happy further coding!
Good enough answer for me :) I get the same, lets hope they fix it soon because XBAP deployment I'm learning to love!
Sorry https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=514760 is related but not same.
Is there a VB6 equivalent to the C/C++ 'continue' keyword? In C/C++, the command 'continue' starts the next iteration of the loop. Of course, other equivalents exist. I could put the remaining code of the loop in an if-statement. Alternatively, I could use a goto. (Ugh!)
numpy is awesome :P
Absolutely Beautiful!
Sorry misunderstood the issue!
This class should be for launch specific utilities, but I agree with you, it makes sense to consolidate until it becomes unwieldy.
hmm, why this should be a problem? attr is a local (to this thread) storage, nobody else will see that?
My bad.
I have two namespaces: 1) Foo.Bar 2) Another.Foo.Bar From a class in namespace 2, how do I reference a class in namespace 1? Using Foo.Bar leaves you in namespace 2 still... I hope this is reasonably clear! Thanks.
Now we have a copy of fiemap and a pointer fiemap. Which one is the "right" one?
Excellent question.
I don't think that it is possible to compare a shelved version with a local version in Visual Studio, however I'll be very happily corrected on the matter.
Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved LGTM; and yes please do upstream.
* release of the framework.
Here's a secret. In the chrome dev tools, do a cpu profile run. After you have stopped capturing, at the bottom of the screen is a down triangle next to "Heavy (Bottom Up)". Click the triangle and select "Flame Chart". Once you are in Flame Chart mode, you can zoom and pan to see the digest cycles, how long they take, and exactly what functions are being called. The Flame Chart is so incredibly useful for tracking down page load issues, ng-repeat performance problems, digest cycle problems! I really don't know how I was able to debug and profile before the Flame Chart. Here is an example:
WPF is a fascinating platform to develop our next generation applications on! The ability to style just about anything, the databinding support and attached/dependency properties. Wow! But let's not throw caution to the wind because while WPF performance is great, it's not the best... yet. Definitely is a strong contender, but as developers we are still left with design principles for our front ends.
instead of this simply add "creation_date_time=creation_date_time" to __init__ method bellow
here we are changing the default to 0666 but in open it is 0777, we should have only one. I think 0777 was chosen based on what python os module does, but could be wrong...
Excellent! You should document that as an answer and accept it so many more people can solve this with a google search on 'single line of text' :)
session_args_t structure is in packet scope. Is this normal to allocate in file scope? And no need to set it to 0, you are assigning it the line below.
I've changed the color scheme on sublime text 2 and I really hate the colors it changed to. So what is the name of the default settings? Because I want to change it back to the standard.
I want to find out how long time there is till a specific from . I have searched everywhere, but can't really find anything. I THINK I have to use the -function together with the -function somehow. The scenario is: I have variable with the day of the week, ex: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 And another variable with a time of the day: hh:mm And the last variable also with a time of the day: hh:mm "How long time" could be like: "2 days, 3 hours and 27 minutes from now" The same output should be generated from a specific datetime. Ex: 06/08/2012 23:55 is "1 day and 13 minutes from now" I really hope you guys can help! :)
Why not use: if ($limit > 0) { } elseif ($limit < 0) { }
Field length expected here is 2, but field below is FT_INT32. Is this an unsigned short (FT_UINT16) ?
An excellent and elegant solution. Kudos.
I was not aware of being required to call that method.
Thanks Thomas!
Ugh, implicit joins! I want to tear my eyeballs out looking at that.
Missed 2 new files - sorry !
sad... very sad.
I wouldn't recommend to use a percentage here.. With "This change is backwards-compatible most of the time" or "This does not change the public API..." we should be on the safe side
I'm using VIM with pythoncomplete. When I'm making a completion, the current window is splitted and calltips are shown in the upper pane. I hate that! Is there a way to prevent that behavior or at least limit the size of the upper pane automaticly?
I agree that a trailing "or" is missing here (though defining a function is_configured and putting the grep's in it would have been better than any commenting. I cannot say that I like duplicating bash logic in English)
I am very jealous of your name!
Great! Good to hear it. Can you please accept my answer? :)
I am completely hopeless with regular expressions... I have a Velocimacro named , and I have a JS function named . Now I want to find all the places the JS function is called. So I need to search for "addButton", where "addButton" doesn't start with the hash key. Any ideas?
I was using an old version of Sinatra - updated to version 1.0 and it works fine :) Thanks everyone!
There's lots of things that I don't know about languages and syntax. +1 because I learned that you can make a setter private inside a public property. Awesomeness ensues!
that's great too! awesome. thank you!
Library independent, very nice! Although I prefer the declaration more "class" like: `function MyClassName() {};`
I'm trying to insert the following array ( from a html form ) but i believe i'm working with this array in a very awful way The array: Actual code: ?> current output: What would be a decent way to do it? EDIT : No need to show how to connect to a database, i just need to deal with the array data.
This way lies metadata hell.
This project looks very promising - thanks!
Should this call Free(), or just remove Free() and put that code in here?
Can anyone help me add children to a plist? I think I want to record an index of rows from the plist and then state which index row to write the key too. I'm not sure how to say if the key will be a string, dictionary or array. The following is code from another question on adding a key to root. Any help would be extremely appreciated :)
it would be nice to use a DTO for the options. this would make it possible to extend it later (which I am pretty sure we will do) without breaking extensions using the interface
This should probably be dlfcn, but I'm not sure. It might be better to split this into another file, and call it something like pthread_dlfcn_test.cpp to indicate this is really a test that is also testing dl related functionality.
Thanks to Edward and Brock for the reviews.
Hi Gregor, Need to make this accessible by adding "class='accessible-hidden'" with relevant details to labels; also add spans for hidden text; anchors with spans; buttons need to have "alt" text; etc. Please refer to: https://wiki.mahara.org/index.php/Accessibility for more details. Thanks, Ghada
Add ": " after "successful" otherwise the detail message will be appended directly onto it without any space.
That means we'll have to add an extra boolean field to every member. It'll make serialization size bigger as well as resident AST memory go up. I'm happy to change it, but it seems like it trades off memory for readability. You'd still have to handle "", because that's the way Java annotations work, you cannot have a default value of 'null'
All macros in southbridge.h are Vortex86EX PCI S/B config register offsets. They are all fixed for Vortex86EX CPU.
that what i was afraid of ! cause my knowledge about ajax is zero :(
If we're trying to make this documentation more consistent with other module pages, then I assume this page is meant to be similar to http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtcore/qtcore-index.html in terms of listing the types provided by the module, so we should add a list here that link to the following types: * Component * QtObject * Binding * Connections * Timer as these are the types provided by the QtQml module.
Add newline. #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hate to say it, but the selected answer is wrong. C# Express ships with 3.5 SP1, including .NET SP2, etc...
Sorry this affects 0.9.3 version too.
You're preforming this check multiple times. it's better to create a separate function, in case we will need to add a new "localhost" name/ip
Good catch. Debugging needs to be removed. Will remove in next patch set.
Very interesting! The code it produces does not work for me but the code is definitely useful as an example. I'll mark this answer as accepted since it seems unlikely an actual reference that says more than MSDN even exists.
no sorry - priorities have been shifted around...
I actually fear that PHP accepts this due to some easteregg or so :)
Flow control keywords must be followed by a single space
@PhilipOakley excellent suggestion! I hadn't used `cherry-pick` before but that worked quite well. If you post as an answer I'll accept.
I guess that works, but I'd never do that. It's screaming bad practice. Think about code readability etc.. Come back to your code in six months and figure out all the function calls inside your HTML markup.
The current solution i implemented is awful! I use a for inserting records from an ADO.NET data-table into an SQL table. I would like to insert at once the data-table into the SQL table, without iterating... Is that possible, or am i asking too much?
Great question! I also find myself a little lost in WPF because of the amount of flexibility it offers and have been looking for guidance in how to choose fonts, layout, spacing, colors, etc. I've had a hard time finding books or websites to improve my UI design skills, so I hope we find great answers here!
So this could be hard to explain but i want to do a for ... := 1 to 10 do statement but i want it to be for A to N do. The main purpose of this excersise is to load data into a string grid. So lets have it load the cells 0,1 0,2 0,3 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 with the Letter A, B, C, D, E all the way up to 14. If anyone knows how to do this i would be extremely thankful!
actually I don't know why it is like this in the login but not in the logout.. I would assume it should be the same in both places, and that this one is the more robust one..
excellent! this user agent switcher is a gold mine!
Yeah, we can file a bug against android or just fix it and submit a patch.
There's no actual need to have this routine similar to how it's done in bit-rot-scrub.c since there just one (1) option to reconfigure. Keep it simple and just do a GF_OPTION_{INIT,RECONF} in the appropriate function.
It seems some of the wrappers in ink_hrtime.h() might no longer be used either e.g. ink_gettimeofday() is never used so lets get rid of that shit.
I know it's just example code, but I really hope your `manager` and `staff` class names are not really lower-case!
This project looks very promising - thanks!
I hate writing migrations, but it's important for the schemas to stay in sync. What I'd much rather do is update my and have Rails notice, then run something which generates the appropriate migration based on the difference between the old version and the current version. Is there a way I can do that?
You removed this line in I1c2a5a9c3da5 with a commit message that noted you wanted COM removal only in the second half of VV, but there was no related change to how that worked. How do we assess when you were right? :-D
Both of these answers were really helpful - thanks!
Put this into a DEPS variable and reuse the value above in gwt_module() too?
Remove strerror(errno) part of this log, as gf_msg will do it when errno is passed
I can do that in an extra commit, here I only wanted to add the possibility to access the created proto_item. But if you want me to, I can add the change to this commit also.
BTW: This is one reason why I hate this autoboxing shit since Java 5. I would love to have a way to prevent it in code (forbidden checks should detect this somehow).
Absolutely terrible!!! It is not Dependecy Injection
Patch Set 1: Thanks for your reviews. To be honest, it would be nice, if you could be a bit more friendly to - not first time in case of Thomas, but occasional - contributors. IMHO one or two -1 are enough for the beginning. Bjrn and Philipp, you're really helpful contributors, thanks for that. We were discussing the "patch for a patch rule" over the last days, which we enjoined on ourselves as core team members some time ago (and it works in at least most of the cases I think). Please don't treat this as harsh words, I just want to make you aware of the fact that motivating every new contributor is very important for us, and hopefully also for you as an essential part of the TYPO3 community. Thanks for your support! Steffen P.S: The reason, why Jenkins fails is probably, because of the parent commit is very old and the patch has to be rebased. Will try to get this done now (if network connection allows)
Excellent! That makes life considerably easier. I really didn't want to add another layer to the application if I could avoid it. As far as StackOverflow etiquette goes, if I set this question as answered, Nikos won't get the rep for it as the answer is in the comments. What's the protocol?
**I HATE GIT !! What a crazy command line syntax**
Sorry my code base is a little old looks like HADOOP-9147 add some new test in TestFileStatus.
Is there a way to reuse a 3rd party control reference? For example, I have this referenced in my App.xaml I don't want to repeat this 3rd party control xml namespace on each page/control that needs a control from the library. Is there anyway to centralize these references and use the prefix defined here? The possibility of each control having a different prefix is also worrisome. In asp.net you would put a reference in the web.config and it was available globally, I'm just looking to see if there is a similar method in WPF.
Ternary gets _extremely_ ugly if you're using more than one else statement, I wouldn't recommend it at all, let alone in this situation.
@massive I've replied to your question about dealing with concurrency issues in bulk updates by editing my answer. Hope this helps!
BTW: This is one reason why I hate this autoboxing shit since Java 5. I would love to have a way to prevent it in code (forbidden checks should detect this somehow).
Agreed. Don't do this, it makes people cry.
Check out GSON for converting POJOs to JSON: We've been using for a couple of years now. Very excellent library. For POJOs to XML, Jersey uses JAXB or you could roll your own serializer.
huh? namedtuple() is a new-style class (otherwise __getattribute__ won't fly for it!). Note that namedtuple(verbose=True) shows that it uses __slot__=() by default, so I'm all for the removal of this redundant line. However the commit message is confusing.
Nice I did not think about using the system tables.
Sorry for that.
Has anyone seen a wordpress plugin slider that will show partially the next and previous image before it slides in? OR does anyone know of one that may be easily customized to show that effect? any demos, guidance or links will be extremely helpful! Thanks very much in advance! Michael
Pretty self explanatory question. I just don't know how to do it. I've been using Eclipse for about a month so I still have a lot to learn. I'm using the newest version of eclipse Juno and need to push the app (or email it) to my MyTouch. How would I do it from eclipse, as that is the way I would prefer? If I should just email it, would I email the whole project folder or just a particular piece of code? I thank you for all your help in advance. This site has been so incredibly helpful!
I've been experimenting with Linq to see what it can do - and I'm really loving it so far :) I wrote some queries for an algorithm, but I didn't get the results I expected... the Enumeration always returned empty: case #1 I changed the query declaration to be inline like this, and it worked fine: case #2 Does anybody know why it doesn't work in case #1 ? The way I understood it, the query wasn't evaluated when you declared it, so I don't see how there is a difference.
This is great! Thanks +1
Tried some more stuff and realized I was doing it wrong.
Excellent tool! Thanks for making it available.
Does anybody have a simple code to display a list (list view?) of all the apps installed on a phone, and have the user open one when clicked? Or even an App drawer. I just need a way to have the user open all of their apps. I have tried searching for tutorials, but couldn't find any, and I downloaded the example home from Android, but I absolutely hate looking through code and digging out what I Want.
I hate writing migrations, but it's important for the schemas to stay in sync. What I'd much rather do is update my and have Rails notice, then run something which generates the appropriate migration based on the difference between the old version and the current version. Is there a way I can do that?
warn: lnet_ping():check that 'tmpid' doesn't leak information (struct has a hole after 'pid')
I currently have speakers set up both in my office and in my living room, connected to my PC via two sound cards, and would like to switch the set of speakers I'm outputting to on the fly. Anyone know an application or a windows API call that I can use to change the default sound output device? It is currently a bit of a pain to traverse the existing control panel system.
I hope fortune favors the brave :)
Managing url paths can be a real pain in ASP.NET. AbsolutePath vs RelativePath vs etc. drives me crazy. I find that many solutions require the user to edit web.config element to include the correct subfolder path; ex. Website Root: Web.config setting: / Website Root: web.config setting: /blog/ Is there a way to properly handle this without having to make changes to the web.config?
As you may know, tonight, at exactly 23:31:30 UTC, Epoch Time will reach 1234567890! Hurray! One way of watching epoch time is by using Perl: Can you do the same in another programming language?
Yes, these queries are horrible. Do a regular join instead.
You don't need to put this xml or a new test class. That means in a previous test case you can just do following: @WithProperties({ @Property(name = "webApiUsage", value = "resistance") }) public void testAnimationImpInResistanceMode() { // your test code here }
Why checking for null pointer here? delete handles null pointers just fine, you only add overhead here.
Ahh, I didn't know that the wsdl command line utility could generate one file for many asmx.... thats awesome! I'll try that out now. I can integrate that into our build process too. Great, thank!
There is no VDSM action here, only database - just make the command transactive, and save yourself all this hassle.
you handle all these exceptions in the same way so you can use multi-catch: } catch (RevisionSyntaxException | AmbiguousObjectException | IncorrectObjectTypeException | IOException e) {
Sorry about that.
Two excellent answers, thank you! I chose Andrew's primarily because I learned a bit more about knockout from it, but both are good options. I'd use RP's method to get something to use in a more generic "anything can be chosen" scenario, but I think making it a single object is probably a better fit for my uses.
thanks for the great tip! I was really thinking of this because this is the only file that change per environment
In our eternal quest to integrate Javascript into our RSpec and Cucumber workflow we're evaluating and are provisionally very excited about it. Any advice on Culerity in general or specifically as compared to Selenium?
This comment doesn't sound right. This if statement should be removed as lapd_handle should already be populated.
docstrings please and thank you :D
Doing a blind re.replace on an XML is a bug waiting to happen. The XML has structure and it is safer to use it. Please parse the XML and replace only the element you expect. Unless, of course, you have a particular intention here.
7 seconds between asking and answering it yourself? Isn't that abusing the system a little?
Still no go, I am afraid :/ This does not remove 'www' from the url.
Excellent tutorial!
Before the goto, you must update errcode. What happens now is that we fall to alloc_error label and then return a success status when actually an error happened and *dst was not populated.
Thanks Jukka for fixing this :) (sorry)
You must redraw your background with each change in your line (thatâs the canvas way) Donât worry, canvas is very fast at redrawing! Here is code and a Fiddle:
Here is an incredibly disgusting way to do it: Here is a better way (I think): If you convert either output string with: you get your original number.
Weird.
Cool cool - thanks stack!
I have a main flash from wich i load another swf file from the server. From time to time i change the second swf file and want to load a fresh copy from the server. I clean the cache from the browser but my client does not know how to do that and it's a pain to give him directions. If i want to load a fresh copy of the main swf i just add a "main.swf?version2" but i can't do that with the loadMovie function in flash. Any ideas how i can get a fresh copy from the server without changing the name of the file?
By definition, nothing is required when we have macros telling whether it is present or not. To avoid having to update this file every time something in one of the implementation files changes, I would move that documentation there. This file is simply about SIMD and defining SIMD properties, not about what SIMD instructions are used in different kernels. Specific comments about verlet kernels belong in the verlet kernel code, not here.
Thanks a lot for your help!
awesome answer! very helpful
I've searched this and cannot find it. I've tried different plugins and different browsers (Firefox, Opera, and Chrome). I've tried most of the no flash plugins for each of those as well as disabling Flash plugins/addons in the settings. I also renamed the file in i found by searching the system. when i renamed it, makes Firefox and Chrome ask to install Flash, but still: returns: I'm not sure what else to try without uninstalling Flash, but that will be a total pain in the ass for this. I also REALLY don't want to use SWFObject just to see if Flash is at all installed which I can do simply with: Any ideas?
@Oded thank you this tool is very great!
pr0n for sure :))))))) (kidding Jonathan)
Because it is used below in g_list_foreach, where gpointer is mandated.
This is an attempt to clear the following dashboard error: https://open.cdash.org/viewBuildError.php?buildid=3611001
This is weird.
should this patch only be added if $(SYSTEM_MYSQL) is NO ?
So I also changed a test to test a non-ascii stopword :)
I disagree. I don't think that would shorten the code by much.
Prefer ordered includes, i.e. VTK headers, vtksys headers, STL/system headers.
Excellent questions! This particular project will need DS, WAYF, etc.
excellent, all working now, thanks !
I've looked at what can be done within the NSIS framework we use to build the Windows installer.
I do not like (long) very much, but that is something in the inode_ctx API :-/ Maybe I find the courage one day to make it a (void*) instead.
You're looking for an equivalent of and I'm afraid it doesn't exist explicitely in the STL. Go for Sebastien's answer if it is correct for your STL implementation.
Something like this? Bonus. With the switch to you have readline editing capabilities, and tab completion on files. Wooow!
It's a command-line tool. Unforunately Xcode doesn't use CodeSense for editing files outside a project, which is incredibly frustrating.
The was a pretty awesome read/reference! Although there are some typos, etc., it is really extensive and has tons of examples. C & C++.
For some reason I thought that the overflow behavior was unnecessary, now I see that it is used in case of multiple dexes. I reverted the change.
Awesome work: this is a great first cut!
Why is powerbuilder community so small? If I have asked anything about JQuery/.NET/PHP, there would have been at least 2-3 answers by now :-(
Is there a selector you can use with $.closest so this doesn't look so godawfully clumsy?
Excellent! Tank you so much, much appreciated.
i am writing a flash app that receives its data over a XMLSocket. On the testmachine that worked really fine, but now the data will be ssl secured. Is there any XMLSSLSocket or something similar available? If not XMLSocket a normal SSLSocket would be a great help as well.
There is no TCP multicast, I'd vote this down, but I don't have enough reputation.
If it's forms auth then yes, that's weird. I'm afraid I don't have any idea!
Sorry typo: "our part" in place of "one part" above.
I am running VS 2012. Working on a project that is stored on a mapped network drive. Whenever I go to close the solution it takes several minutes (5-7) for Visual Studio to close. It does eventually close, but very painful waiting for it to finish. Anyone have any suggestions on how to fix?
Copied from sys_openbsd_386s.s and missed - fixed :)
I really like what I am seeing so far.
Ah, 400 million is a much less scary number!
Ok, here's one way of doing this, but it's terrible! I'm still looking for an easier way:
The previous solution is really great! However, I'm looking for one more feature: is it possible to eager load last subordinate record before a specific date? This is needed so that my users can browse a history a song's votes (with links to previous and next days).
I think there's a function for doing this. Maybe display_name()? I think you pass it a whole "usr" record and viewer and it figures out how to display it.
Everything in the terminal buffer. Command history is easy, just 'history'. Sometimes there's an exception or a log I want to grab, but it went off the screen or select-all is a pain. I want to make a cmd line tool that does it and maybe sends it to a new gist.
Also your username was stupidly named and confusing so I deleted it and created a new one more appropriate.
missing a comma here, can you help adding it back? ;)
@Brant - No worries!
I am have used the remove data method to remove validation from the page. This works but throws an error in the console window and crashes with IE8 (I'm being forced to develop to this browser...sad I know!). Does anyone know how I can stop this error? Here is my code to remove the validator: Here is the error message from the console:
This isn't going to pass pep8 anyway because this line is too long and the parameters to getattr don't have proper spacing. And why are we still looking at exc.message here?
that's great too! awesome. thank you!
Doc string needs to be changed. This does not return anything. it can be something like- This function verify detail of referenced datastore.
Ah that was my bad.
Excellent code @ Peter, but not to be generating consecutive events, it might be better to use unbind (), like this: Thanks!
I have but instead of bothering them I'd like to do it myself. I really enjoy trying new things and so far figuring all of this out has been very fun!
After installing a lot of apps, and building a few myself, I'm sure many people have been wondering about this. If I'm looking through my SD card it looks absolutely horrible, and its really hard to find folders that are mine for putting music/videos/pictures in between all the folders for different applications. Is there any conventions here that we, the developers, should try to put their apps into one base folder or has Google forgot about this completely?
Use Web Essentials... it works really great, and has lots of other useful tidbits!
It's a terrible idea to include a using directive in a header file too. This simply mitigates that problem.
we must make sure the paste file is in absolute path mode: config_path = os.path.abspath(config_path) ?
Hell or high water.
Are we sure the the same set of changes are not required for other daemons as well?
@Stilly.stack wooow I didn't know that that was important!! thanks a lot :)
Works pretty good for me, you perfectionists! (just teasing)
here is some code to have a gif (that already have transparency in it) transformed (supposed you want to resize it) in bitmap and then can be showed properly with it's transparency. Good luck ! GrÃ©goire Lafortune
Not for me, but I can suggest some possibilities :It may cause problem while editing--> This can be solved by using some comments--> And then this will cause the code messier Some code may crash and your code success will go away from you |.|--> No solution - unless you know more about the code! Code upgrade problem-- If external code has upgrade you may have problem to know which is that code--> Again use comments--> And again messier So these are some that I can think about!EDIT---Some cons:You can make it more convenient to edit--> You can edit more than one code at onceYou can edit some code that you wan't able to edit (external resource before)--> Modifying is more convenient.You can make it load faster--> 1 file with 1000 KB is faster than 1000 files with 1 KB each.It is safer--> You don't need to worry about external resource being deleted!!These are my suggestions. Try to think more about it!
what about Jigal's comment "Copying an array for the sake of a variable name is a waste of resources IMO." ?
Just a pre-emptive note, I put these TODO's in the code, because they are separate refactoring issues, which would be better handled in a separate bug.
@TonyThinkk No worries!!
If we're trying to make this documentation more consistent with other module pages, then I assume this page is meant to be similar to http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtcore/qtcore-index.html in terms of listing the types provided by the module, so we should add a list here that link to the following types: * Component * QtObject * Binding * Connections * Timer as these are the types provided by the QtQml module.
That is great news!
I'm starting to think of "DLL Hell."
Trying to get S60 SDK working on Linux is quite a pain. Still struggling with that.
Thanks for the answers. I've found a great sitemap generator over at codeplex. If anyone is interested you can check it out here: Enjoy!
ec_combine_statfs is updates the avail size to max, with this we are not getting the correct value. In the below output, avail size should be 99.7G. root@rh1:~/workspace/git/glusterfs # df -h /mnt Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on rh1:/vol1 100G 290M 100G 1% /mnt
Passing a whole volfile path this way seems a bit fragile. Would it be possible to pass the flag and a *relative* path, so that the receiver constructs the final path instead of the sender?
My bad.
It's HORRIBLE! No, seriously, I don't like it.
This is one thing that I really hate within development is forms. Below is my code and what I am trying to do is align the inputs with the labels . Is there a rule that you use to help remember when coding forms? CSS: HTML:
might as well drop the conditional and just assign it
I think the question is valid. I agree with the other responses, but it doesn't mean it's a terrible question. I've only ever had to use a Safari CSS hack once as a temporary solution and later got rid of it. I agree that you shouldn't have to target just Safari, but no harm in knowing how to do it. FYI, this hack only targets Safari 3, and also targets Opera 9.
Why the hell is this not a bug?
this is an excellent link thanks a ton! havent gone through it in detail. just glanced. but it looks really promising. Will read it in detail shortly
And boy hell broke loose ;) So... the biggest issue I'm facing is indeed with Random sharing across threads.
Add expert info if there is pad high and no pad low ? and also a generated hf with the padding length ?
I've got a table with a BLOB collum. What I want to do is get it to be able to pick out words and list them in order. For example if it contained: Bob Smith likes cheese but loves reading Charlie likes chocolate milk Charl loves manga but also likes cookies Then I would get likes loves as a result... is this possible and if so how? I'd like to be able to do it in just mysql alone, but I can use php as well. Thanks in advance, kenny
If no version can be parsed "0.0.0" â€” "0.0.0" is the result
I personally hate this! commands should not go to a redirected file. I think your redirect options should be off, on, verbose - and only verbose should add commands
Why not just adjust the check upstairs to (m->total_size?:2048) > (microcode_end - (u32)c) then you won't need this check if you assume that cbfs is correct and if you don't cbfs check belongs to cbfs functions, not here.
I have but instead of bothering them I'd like to do it myself. I really enjoy trying new things and so far figuring all of this out has been very fun!
I'm trying to test if a character in a string is a space, and I'm getting extremely frustrated: I'm not getting any errors and I've looked online, but people on different forums say this is how to test for a space. Uh.
What a strange website candyundies.com sounds disgusting!
i wonder where you see that - i don't. maybe it's not explicit enough for your taste in telling you that you are an idiot if you try? make the setup script simply refuse such qt versions.
Short and to the point... excellent! +1
We would prefer to keep this. It is possible for the RILD and radio code to pass the sequence number through into radio state as the request is being acted on - the RILD may notice the socket error and re-establish the connection and then the response comes back from the radio with the old sequence number and get's passed back through the newly-connected RILD. Just because your implementation may not do this, we can imagine other OEMs passing back obsolete responses that would match a newly-zero'd RIL sequence number and confuse things. Couldn't you just remember the first sequence number your RILD connection received? Then you know the number of requests you've received.

But what we are using is oslo version. I think this should be fixed in oslo. I submitted a patch to oslo https://review.openstack.org/56211
Ignoring how ridiculously lame it is to ask a question and answer it in this fashion seconds later, this is an awful answer, and that is why it is voted down. Why will you only see a small speedup? Can you provide numbers? Platforms tested on? This answer is even more vague than the original question, which was vague to begin with.
This should also be converted GF_VALIDATE_OR_GOTO, take this as global comment
Thanks for sweet patch Erik.
Anyone??? I'm starting to hate VS for that reason!
Holy (*&^. I just looked at the jquery solution: add a hidden element to the DOM containing every conceivable tag and then reverse engineer the geometry conventions. The web is truly amazing place!
About { on the same line? yeah it's probably on the one below.
It is a nasty bug that I've seen in real life though.
I've just stumbled onto this one there you will find a couple of REALLY GREAT templates!!!
This sounds like an excellent project! You might want to start with the module. You might also be interested in the module. Perhaps to get you started, here's a function that takes a path to a file and backs the file up by copying it and giving it a .bak extension.
WOW people THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ANSWERS!!!! (bow)
Am I doing something stupid here?
I use the gem for transparent usage of Memcached. Using the supplied config file it is enabled on all modes (development, test, production). Is there a way to only activate cache-money in production mode? It's not immediately clear how to do this, and it's a total pain dealing with caching in development mode.
yeah it working fine :) Thanks !!
Doh!
+1 pines is excellent!
@DaveBish, What an excellent tool! I will be using this ALOT in future! :-)
then you might want to take full control over how Preferences should follow your desired storage by implementing . You can see a linux based implementation here: Good luck!
I have discovered a mode in , where I can instantly change all same variables. When I am in this mode I get a box around the same variables and I can change one and instantly all others change. I do not know how to enter this mode "by will", I just entered it "randomly". Therefore, I really appreciate your suggestions, how to enter this mode, because it is extremely useful to me! PS.: I am using NO plugins, just a plain new eclipse installation with java!
I assume this is not a memmap version of 16550/8250?
Ho yes, perhaps I should change the commit message ? It's because the policy was set to NEW, so it will do nothing anyway, as we are already using cmake > 2.6.0
Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this I agree with the first reviewer, turning the condition around will make it better readable. Besides that, great idea and solution!
ok, but then i suggest you turn that thing into a macro which you can document centrally (QT_SEGMENTED_STRING_LITERAL or so). also, a warning in the QStringLiteral doc would be in order if it's not there yet.
Thanks a lot!

talks about consuming WCF services in Silverlight, but claims: There will be no proxies, no generated code, no 3rd party utilities, and no disgusting "Add Service Reference" usage. What is so wrong with me adding a service reference in my Silverlight project? Are there hidden overheads? Or is it a case of Fear Of Auto Magic on the part of the author?
This may result in broken implementations since they could already have a longer URL. Highly unlikely, but possible.
Separate patch and please use a tab for consistency. A separate patch could unify that too I guess.
that's an awful lot of swapping hold and pattern spaces...
If you're running on Windows, you could do something similar using PowerShell. This could be extended pretty easily to find all unversioned and ignored files and delete them. Hope that's helpful to someone!
Please add more functional/features tests on this conf file when you add the rest of the code.

To add on to mwigdahl's excellent post: [here](https://ribosome.helixcommunity.org/2005/devdocs/FuncLevelLinking)'s a link that explains how to achieve FLL for g++ -- this may give you some additional insights.
this is a really great idea!!! please standby while i try thank u so much
I don't see how this is possible, but I really, really hate to run my query an extra time just to get the record count so I can build a pager. When I say a "pager" I simply mean the common gizmo with a link for each 10 records for example.
My guess would be from a colleague who wanted to scare this person out of ever using 'this' again. It can be fairly annoying when someone uses 'this' for every single thing they do. Not that it justifies lying to a new programmer, but I can imagine someone doing this out of frustration.
follow up? hate all this stuff getting bikeshed for weeks for that sort of thing. can you also check out 6465, 6463.
Great, excellent links. Thanks for the help!
except doesn't this failure mean "i couldn't read the command file"? for which "no command" doesn't seem like a bad error.
@DonQuestion Yep. My account is domain admin so it should be ok... really annoying problem! arg
Hi Miklos, I have mentioned the relevant comments for this impacted UT in the commit message as well. Kindly have a look. Thanks.
#ERROR!
Each tab in my xcode project can have navigation/debug/utility menus open. If I close those menus on one tab, then switch to the next, they may be open. This is really frustrating! If I want the menus closed, I want them closed on all tabs. How can I change this behavior?
Is there an easy way to find parse errors in javascript code? Last week I was debugging a javascript problem where the first javascript function that was called gave an 'object expected' error. I later determined that this was because the browser wasn't able to parse my javascript code. I eventually solved the problem but it was a painful process that involved pouring over my code line by line, trying to find my mistake. There must be an easier way.
Hey, I am trying to further my knowledge of javascript and was wondering if anyone could explain to me what exactly is happening in the script below: Most importantly, why are there 4 'google_ ad_ ...' at the beginning and what is the purpose of them? A line by line explanation would be awesome :) Thanks for any help. I really appreciate it.
My first instinct is to branch normally (using p4 integrate), and then use an IDE or sed script to change the package names. But this makes future integration from the trunk extremely painful.
With auto-generated CRUD methods you don't need to define these methods manually. Please check this patch https://review.openstack.org/#/c/62865/
Some file were missing in the last patch sorry.
My patch wouldn't compile.
If double logins presented, it skipped it... looks so terrible))
We kept this in r46 to keep some minor behaviour consistent. By omitting this in r50, we are actually keeping the behaviour of rc and final consistent, modulo the bug fix - see this function in git diff 53fc9d0 -- src/gromacs/mdlib/coupling.c. Since the r50 tests are already generated with the new RNG, we should expect those tests to continue to pass.
indeed! Sorry, I assumed that this function was tested and it seems trivial to me since in Oracle/Sybase this works like a charm would you mind sending a patch fixing the fn_db_delete_config_values as well and put me as a reviewer ? thanks
I have a page running on my local django dev server with the Django Debug Toolbar that seems to be running quite slowly but I'm unsure why: Django Debug Toolbar says SQL - 46 queries in 39.80ms And then running a profiler I get 7926 function calls (7774 primitive calls) in 0.024 seconds So I'm left wondering why is the profile time so much lower than the Total CPU Time? And then how can I find out what's causing the difference? And secondary to that - should i be worried about the 16842 involuntary context switches!?
@JonesV excellent! I think thats what I wanted: "//*vptr is address of first virtual function in VTABLE viz. display()"

Thanks Dianne!
You didn't mention the language, but for Java we've loved . For C/C++, getopt.
That's weird.

You shouldn't need this - I have a patch in flight to our gtest - see https://github.com/daverigby/gtest/tree/clang_analyzer which will make the GTest asset macros "understood" by clang analyser.
i really love the idea of it as i can create a folder for my user control, and make sub folder images, css, and put local resource file, so the whole thing is contained in one folder, and that makes it really efficient for me (management wise). but the bugger is you cant get intellisence like global resource, so is it possible in any way ?

Excellent thank you guys!
Finally found something, here: No reference to it from the Oracle pages, but found a direct link to a page on some forum post. Really sad how hard it was to find.
I don't think the comparison with the SshCommands (or RestViews) is fair. For SSH commands we have a simple lookup by command name and it is all that matters. For project rename tasks it may be (and probably is) critical in which order the steps are executed. It is not just a set of tasks that can be done in any order. For a critical command as project rename the order of tasks execution should be explicit. At least it has to be documented. Right now, one has to look in the TaskModule, then in the DynamicSet and find out that, internally, it stores its items in a list which means that the iterator() will iterate in the order of the elements as they are in this list. And this is not even documented/guaranteed behavior of the DynamicSet.
I have a basic app written with ATL, using the wizard with VS2008. I have a treeview in the left side of the app. I see how to (painfully) add tree items. Question is how do I show a menu when the mouse is right clicked? How do I trap any click events on each item that could be selected?
Using the . seems to be the preferred way of doing this and orca screenreader does not read out the fullstop so that is good
@Jatin Can you make an answer. The link is pretty fine!!! I just need such things
excellent, thank you!
Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved I concur with jrbarnette@. It sounds like we can do a separate issue/CL for removing the pragma. To that end, I think a TODO() referring to that issue could be useful if added to this CL.
This is a method in Java, that(when k == 0) in int[] arr has one of k-combination int[] intems. In variable iloczyn is calculated product of elements in this combination. In tmp is calculated sum of all such products. Unfortunately, System.out.println(tmp) shows, that when function ends, tmp equals 0. This is very sad, because i need this variable for next calculations. What shoud I do?
quotad count already there. please remove this from your code.
I just caught that, Firefox doesn't preform spell checking on the title field for some reason.

Per:https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213?hl=enYou need to be registered as a member of a Google + or Google Group that is designated for Beta or Alpha testing by the Developer. If you are not registered, you will only be able to download the production app from Google Play, NOT the Beta or Alpha version of the app from Google Play. Having the "link" won't be sufficient, you need to opt-in to the beta or alpha via Google + or Google Group. Please note that even if you properly opt-in via Google + or Google Groups as defined by the developer, you will need to wait several hours (perhaps 2-8 hours) for your status to propagate via Google Play. So, perhaps you need to wait 2-8 hours even if your Beta/Alpha status is proper?Hope this helps!

For C# Visual Studio uses 4 spaces by default, whereas for C++ it is hard-tabs. Why is it so? Why is it different? My project consists of both C# and C++ code and the difference really annoys me. I want to set a common standard for all the sources, but I wonder if this would have any drawbacks.
I'm working on importing data from our application into Oracle Financials GL. It seems simple with the GL_INTERFACE table, and many resources online, but I don't seem to understand it. I'm looking for a simple way to post a transaction of $X on a specific date, between 2 or more accounts. I'm terrified of incorrectly posting anything in the GL.

1. This seems like a hack to work around a bug -- why are we reading from the pty after it is closed? 2. This hack also looks too broad -- if any error occurs we close the pipe and stop reading, while squelching the error. This seems bad. Same comments below.
Sorry about that...

Sorry for the super-slow uptake on this the new job is using up all of my limited brain resources.
great question, wondering it myself!
I have run into this too. It is very annoying! Here's why it might be happening. The width of your li items, plus any margins is more than the width of #maincontainer. That means the last li item spills over #maincontainer and the script will want to move that last bit in, leaving an extra click. One way to check this: assign an id to the last li, and make the width less, and see if that doesn't fix it. If so you need to make the #maincontainer wider.
That's depressing :/ Are you sure I can't get a collection of all controls on the page with a particular class and give them a single data source?

Sorry for the delay.
I've got an application that I'm moving over to ClickOnce and the app has a moderately sized data folder with hundreds of files that I need to inlcude in the deployment. The folder needs to be in the same place relative to the EXE after deployment. I've seen several suggestions on how to do this but there doesn't seem to be a agreed upon method for doing this. Any suggestions would be great - Thanks!
Apple's MapCallouts code sample demonstrates how do do this with the callout and their Weather Map sample shows how to do custom annotation views. There documentation is really excellent and these samples are both helpful.
Matt... I'm an idiot I used the wrong patch. Sigh.

Basically you've got to call the method with reflection: Get the generic method template with Call passing in your 4 type parameters Invoke the method passing in the regular arguments It's a pain :(
sorry.. redeploy patch
The patch went to the wrong bug.
My application links against libsamplerate.a. I am doing this to make distributing the final binary easier. I am worried that perhaps the code inside the .a file depends on some other libraries I also will need to distribute. But if it doesn't I am worried I am bloating up my application too much by including multiple copies of eg. libc. What exactly will be inside libsamplerate.a? Just libsamperate's bytecode? Or more?

I have a long scrolling page, and want to test if an element is 100px from the top, then apply a class elsewhere (until the next element in line is 100px from the top) If I could just get the basic statement I would be ecstatic, anything extra would be a bonus!
the following code should show either the port or servername not both i always get both no matter what ? i have also tried the follwoing with no joy either !! i just cannot get the condition to resolve thanks in advance
I appreciate your warm welcome, I never seen such a warm regard here for trying to be helpful, it was a really pleasant introduction and I want to thank you for taking your time to write - at last the end of the questions reads "If anyone has any ideas I would be extremely grateful!"

Its really depressing. Ended up with downloading the whole bundle again.
Check out the WordPress repository. There is a plugin called WP GCM Its a very great one and has some great extras!
It looks like this allows a user who cannot see all branches to probe which branches exist. By looking at the error message "it doesn't exist" vs. "user does not have rights to delete it." a user can detect if a branch that is not visible to him exists.
It adds more things to go wrong than just downloading everything again to do a reinstall. I understand the desire, downloads are a pain, but downloading again is a much more predictable zero state than some set of possibly-correct archives on local disk checked against some possibly-correct set of hashes. All of which is a lot of extra moving parts to work around a problem (slow connections). Is it worth it? Maybe. But it is a lot more to go wrong.
Yep, not sure why it was using a string there. Thanks.
I have spent days trying to find any information or working samples on how I can get google data such as emails in my gmail inbox, list of my contacts, my calendar events etc... None whatsoever :( There are broken pieces of some code fragments here and there, 90% say it's been deprecated, is the a one single page on the internet that gives me a working example how to do that from javascript. Many pages about oAuth, but I have absolutely no idea how to use it , I have spent days reading broken pieces here and there, but I was unable to understand what that it and how I can use it PRACTICALLY. Very sad, and I am very tired to waste so much time on things that dont work and are not documented in human language, possible to understand. Why do they have to overcomplicate thing so much and spread broken pieces of information everywhere?
My form receives asynchronous callbacks from another object on random worker threads. I have been passing the data to the main thread (where it can be used to update onscreen controls) using delegates as shown below. Performance is dreadful -- once I reach 500 updates per second, the program completely locks up. My GUI processing itself is not the problem, as I can simulate this level of updating within the form and have no problems. Is there a more efficient mechanism I should be using to hand off the data from thread to thread?
I misread.
Thanks Myrna.
Good to know, I'd specify this in the doc -- i.e. don't touch *any* QObject
> I hated that aspect of working for commercial companies.
EDIT: Also you should avoid using it can make debugging extremely frustrating.
Because we don't need anything that it provides (checking that the value is not None and encoding it) so there's not much point pulling it out of the loop below. Actually, we would have to leave it in the loop below as well since it uses the `env' outer variable.
Well, this is still a parameter, so you should probably leave the line.
that is very very sad
I am planning to use community sever for one of our projects, i used it in the past but we had a lot of problems customizing it and understanding how things work, im affraid to get into that again, and i would like to add some things to it but i dont know how flexible it is.
Ha sorry Varun thanks for the reminder I will have a look at it soon...
there should be } else { rv = get_env_plugin_info(pi); In this case the lcb_cntl user will get correct effective type

Patch Set 5: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve Rebased with current master Took comments into account. Using 4.3 in deprecation log as it is like that in config_default but using @deprecated with 4.6 and remove in 4.8 to stick to our rules.
I think that this class makes more sense than the Branch class because there are several places in Gerrit where refs strings are manipulated without using Branch objects. Jgit does define some of those constants, but we cannot use jgit everywhere, particularly in GWT, which I suspect is why this class is here in the first place. We need a good place in Gerrit for these constants, and the Branch object itself is a much higher level object than this simple class (it isn't only about refs, but rather refs and projects). These constants feel more appropriate here to me than in the Branch class. I have some more changes, which I will push, which move them out of the Branch class completely. I am willing to update the comment here if need be, but this class feels appropriate to me (based on its name and location) and I don't think that "naive" comment should get in the way of that.
I want to find out how long time there is till a specific from . I have searched everywhere, but can't really find anything. I THINK I have to use the -function together with the -function somehow. The scenario is: I have variable with the day of the week, ex: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 And another variable with a time of the day: hh:mm And the last variable also with a time of the day: hh:mm "How long time" could be like: "2 days, 3 hours and 27 minutes from now" The same output should be generated from a specific datetime. Ex: 06/08/2012 23:55 is "1 day and 13 minutes from now" I really hope you guys can help! :)
I am working on an app that uses some basic view types, but I find the default attributes extremely ugly in Android (for example, a bright yellow ). I can get the basic seekbar if I create it from code, using only the parameter, but I would like to know if there is a way to do this inside an XML Layout file. Is there an attribute I can set that will remove all default attributes - such as ?
+1 excellent question. Personally I'm starting to think that externals should never have been allowed to track the HEAD of other repositories. Always specifying the exact revision of the external is much safer.
I had figured out the solution. What I realized was happening was that The deployments stopped working period, not just certain files were not coming across. This is absolutely a bug in Azure deployment as near as I can figure. I had to drop & recreate my site in the cloud and the deployment continued to work. As a side rant. Microsoft makes it extremely painful for someone to submit a bug as compared to other software vendors. And they wonder why their market share is shrinking.
Thanks Areek new patch looks great; I'll commit shortly.
this parameter doesnt currently exist in compat; I dont know why it is being introduced here.
I understand its not a desirable circumstance, however if I NEEDED to have some kind of HTML within JSON tags, e.g.: is this possible to do in Python without requiring to to be escaped beforehand? It will be a string initially so I was thinking about writing a regular expression to attempt to match and escape these prior to processing, but I just want to make sure there isn't an easier way.
Element. This one stuck out. I think the only ones to try to capitalize are "Allocation, Type, Element", since that trio is the dominant set of APIs for interacting with any sort of data from Java.
nit: this sentence has six commas and two separate alternations ('or's). Maybe it could be split up?
Sorry I didn't use your patch but I think you'll like the end result.
Hasn't made a difference I'm afraid :(
Thanks for taking a look Jiannan
Sorry guys I've been pretty busy work but I have been watching this.
Doh!
The main thing about "Dev Mode Off" is that it works even when the code server isn't running. Perhaps it's less useful with this change, but I don't want to remove it yet.
This should read: This survey tests the local metadata performance using the echo_client to drive the MDD layer to perform operations. It is run with multiple threads (to simulate MDT service threads) locally on the MDS node, and does not need Lustre clients in order to run.
indent. But how about defining skipontest() { if [ -z "${TESTING_ENV}" ] ; then "$@" else: echo skipping "$@" } It should be added to ovirt_store_config (in case the test happens to be run on ovirt-node).
Luke Sorry for the late attaching latest version patch
I've tried something similar (I removed the handlers and kept the readers) but the performance was not visible.
Instead of having "%s" of "%s" I'm thinking it should be "%s" belonging to "%s" I feel that both "Page 1 belonging to Group 1" and "Page A belonging to Robert Lyon" make more sense than "Page 1 of Group 1" and "Page A of Robert Lyon"
For coreboot, maybe you could insert: assert(OpFlag == AccessWidth8); before the "if" to ensure that coreboot users aren't tripped up. I'm the first guy to discourage unnecessary changes to vendorcode, but this code is broken and we should somehow warn users about it. It would be even better if we could make the code fail by static analysis instead of a runtime assert.
i wonder if there is something similar to Sql Profiler for Sql Server Compact Edition? i use SqlCE as backend for a desktop application and it would be really great to have something like sql profiler for this embedded database. or at least something simliar to the NHibernate show_sql feature... any ideas? thanks j.
I am currently using the following jQuery script to highlight rows in my table, and it works great! This works great for tables of data where each row is truly a new record, however, I have run into an issue where I have records that take up two rows of data and would like to modify the jQuery so it renders something like: How would I accomplish this in jQuery where I want every 3rd row to have a class of 'alt1' and every 4th row to have a class of 'alt2'? Thanks in advance!
can do it ! And you can find other plugins on the . Note that you cannot use this plugin with github pages. This video is excellent !
Why do you set the value to true for the requiresAuthentication here since it is already set when you create the class !
All the places I've worked have given me liberty with regard to development environment, although the production env. has always been some brand of Linux - usually RH or CentOS. I personally use Windows 7 for dev., and I wouldn't use anything else. You spend way less time debugging the OS, and more time coding. This makes management much happier! (PHP developer mostly)
It would be helpful if the returned structure were described more fully, just for clarity.
I've uploaded an alternative in patch set 5, which you might dislike less :-)
By the way, I agree with Henrik P. Hessel. This is a very horrible piece of code.
ok, but then i suggest you turn that thing into a macro which you can document centrally (QT_SEGMENTED_STRING_LITERAL or so). also, a warning in the QStringLiteral doc would be in order if it's not there yet.
Thanks to your excellent instruction, I understood enough to figure out what was going on and also what was needed! Here's what I came up with. It's clunky but it does the job! Thanks again everyone.
My form receives asynchronous callbacks from another object on random worker threads. I have been passing the data to the main thread (where it can be used to update onscreen controls) using delegates as shown below. Performance is dreadful -- once I reach 500 updates per second, the program completely locks up. My GUI processing itself is not the problem, as I can simulate this level of updating within the form and have no problems. Is there a more efficient mechanism I should be using to hand off the data from thread to thread?
Please use import for java.util.Arrays, instead using explicitly here.
I know neither is true for now, but I really want these to be true. I heard that ruby-gnome2 and shoes are the top most used desktop libraries for ruby. since shoes and gtk depends on some common things, and shoes give a higher abstraction for UI, why not go a step further to merge them? make shoes totally on top of GTK. I respect different intent of shoes' creators, so, just a question to make me clear. Thanks very much for your great job!
That's weird.
No worries, main thing is your problem gets solved!
Thanks Koji!
that's some very dangerous advice!
I have never parsed ini files, so I can't be too specific on this issue. But i have one advice: Don't reinvent the wheel as long as an existing one meets your requirements Good luck :)
Ahh that's funny! :D Good that you payed attention! Done
Smart pointers are initialized to NULL already in there constructor.
I've got a php array: I want to pass this array via jQuery AJAX, with this: And here's my jQuery: How can I pass the array, so that with the "replyMessage.php" page, I could take each ID from the Array, to do something like this: Any help is greatly appreciated!
should this patch only be added if $(SYSTEM_MYSQL) is NO ?
please move command to system.py so this can be reduced to "cmd_node_init".
I'm an idiot... there's nothing wrong with the readme.txt.
I had the same problem and ended up doing the same workaround. When I was done I didn't really hate it though, because it allowed me to free-up the UIPageViewController and all of it's child UIPageViewControllers and all of their resources when the user wasn't actively using the tab.
This doesn't work properly when the index is negative (e.g. time is before the offset).
Sorry.
I actually fear that PHP accepts this due to some easteregg or so :)
Very well put, I really like this !!!
Unable to reproduce issue.
It looks like this allows a user who cannot see all branches to probe which branches exist. By looking at the error message "it doesn't exist" vs. "user does not have rights to delete it." a user can detect if a branch that is not visible to him exists.
Excellent! Worked perfectly!
IMHO this two functions are unnecessary. There are only validates (oh my...) Better if will be done in the level using the parameters.
In our eternal quest to integrate Javascript into our RSpec and Cucumber workflow we're evaluating and are provisionally very excited about it. Any advice on Culerity in general or specifically as compared to Selenium?
Damn Chuck is scary.
Not sure this answers the question accurately, what does everyone else think?
I am completely hopeless with regular expressions... I have a Velocimacro named , and I have a JS function named . Now I want to find all the places the JS function is called. So I need to search for "addButton", where "addButton" doesn't start with the hash key. Any ideas?
k. Just thought because I removed not supported stuff, tested it and improve code quality qulifies me. I'll remove it.
it will be used by the UI from a query: when suggesting auto-completion of all existing labels
The user might still want to disable it... Unlike the other options, this one does not need a pirq_table.c or mptable.c file be sitting around... Generally dropping these tables from the build is almost never worth it, since most OSes expect something there.
completely agree, there are excellent answers provided here to this question
You have my deepest sympathies. I feel your pain. I was trapped in that world for a while.
Sorry probably a misunderstanding from my side....
the two are not mutually exclusive, archmage.
+1 for both the answer and the comments. Priceless :)
All I'm trying to say is that it's pretty easy to end up in propagation failure hell here or change something else that blows things up for use cases that are not foreseen.
I'm having an extremely frustrating experience attempting to change directories in python using variables within the program. Specifically, suppose I have: gives OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '$dir_name' and yet returns 'Directory_Name_999' (a valid directory name) and similarly changes the directory without error. Where am I going wrong here?
I think this should say Alias for 'gerrit remove plugin' (see line 150)?
+1 for this question - I have the same issue.
That's terrific, thank you!
Don't think this is really needed. See comments in PartialStateSystem. Also, protected fields, no no!
I'm running into extremely frustrating problems with Boost. When I try running something as simple as I get back: Why is this error occurring, and how do I make Boost.Lambda do what I need? (Yes, I'm aware I can use Boost.Phoenix et al. too, but that's not the point of the question.)
I appreciate your warm welcome, I never seen such a warm regard here for trying to be helpful, it was a really pleasant introduction and I want to thank you for taking your time to write - at last the end of the questions reads "If anyone has any ideas I would be extremely grateful!"
I have created a VB.Net lending application for a cooperative that caters to widows. The application tracks the members' loans and payments, and is also used as an accounting system. In my first release, the users felt that showing a messagebox every time an error occurs is very annoying. My solution is to output errors in a label control. The users accepted the modification, but i feel i am doing it wrong.
Warned about same in doc string. It'd be more safe to remove this method altogether.
today you - my personal Super Hero!
Try this: If you are really finding yourself getting interested in SpriteKit, then I suggest you expand your knowledge with some excellent tutorials. This will make your experience a lot less frustrating and put you on the road to becoming the next Angry Birds creator! Take a look at the tutorials on this site http://www.raywenderlich.com
I'm reading an excellent article by Paul White - ! and he uses this code: I'm trying to find out more about using dbo.Name to declare a variable, not having much luck with books online. Any ideas where I can find this? Thanks
I did not suggest that the acquire/release functions would be called globally for all NI. I said "each time an interface that needs the acceptor". If the interface doesn't use the acceptor don't call acquire at startup, and don't call release at shutdown. I don't much care about the length of the list or the time involved. I am looking for code that is more easy to read and maintain.
Everytime I create a new IK handle in Maya via MEL, it creates an end effector named "effector1", or "effector2", depending on what is in my scene. I don't want to rely on the auto-name of the end effector, so I'm wondering if there is a way to either: a) name the effector at the create-time of the IK handle, or b) select the effector for a particular IK handle in MEL. Any help would be greatly appreciated -- thanks!
Wow, great ! Thanks a lot !
I'm trying to show a currency dynamicly, that works totally fine! But I'd like to change the pattern from "SFr. 150'000.00" to "150'000.00 SFr." (and still keep it dynamicly!) Any suggestions how I could do that? Here is the code: Thanks in advance!
That's an excellent idea! I was able to convert the plugin, but it just crashes VS when I click on it in the menu.
Furthermore if you need to look at the .NET/unmanaged stack just donwload and look at your w3wp.exe processes to examine memory and other stats without having to do a remote/local debugging (just look at the .NET Tab on the properties of the process). It will show all the .NET performance counters for that particular process. Awesome tool!
Check out the WordPress repository. There is a plugin called WP GCM Its a very great one and has some great extras!
That's too sad :(
been looking at this for days..
StyleReports is one of the most heinous toolsuites I've ever had to use.
Good Morning, I'm using SharePoint Designer 2007 to create a workflow for a MOSS site I have created. What I'm looking to do is have the workflow send out an email if a document in the library hasn't been modified for the past 30 days (and it's Status field is not set as "Closed"), but I'm stumped as to how I can do this. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
excellent! exactly what I was looking for. Thanks Anna.
Excellent! I'm glad you were able to get it work for you. Best of luck with SAS!
I agree with @Rogeria. this doesn't explain why it is called the IoC and I am surprised by the number of up votes ;-)
The really sad thing is I could do this in about 5 lines of Ada code...
No it's not - leaving the dob blank means you just choose not to fill it in as the field itself is not compulsory.
When I slide to a next image, or when the slider/carousel automatically switches to the next image the previous image disapears too fast, which gives it an extremely ugly look. I've made a video to make clear what I mean, can be checked over here. Anyone has an idea? Code for the carousel:
Moving this logic to ProcjectControl will also require additional modifications in ReceiveCommits. My approach fixes both issues in one place. Also this approach protect us from making same error in future. Personally I wouldn't move this logic to upper level. Signature of this method can be changed to canCreate(Map<Stirng, Ref>, RevWalk, RevObject) instead of using Repository. But IMO will keep this logic here to prevent from this issue in future.
Based mostly on , but also , and my own experience, I don't think it's possible without a lot of ugliness, pain or without converting your LINQ to SQL code generation over to (not appealing, IMO).
Very cool.
Use spaces, rather than tabs, here, for consistency.
wouldn't this be subject to the same bug if the server answers something different for one of the keys, like 0x86 TEMP_FAIL? what about doing a response.Read while it's not returning -1 (socket.isAlive == false)? the NOOP already returns from the loop, but the case where correlationId doesn't map to a key should maybe also be a break from the loop, not a continue?
Unless we switch to Antlr 3.0 ( and even though I'm not sure this would fix the problem) there is nothing we can do.
8 hours? That's pretty quick! My last InnoSetup installation coding took TEN DAYS, and it still won't work right on Vista. It installed an app library, some sample apps, created a database, installed and started 2 windows services, and published a web site, but 10 days is still far too long...
You can't make changes directly to OOJS directly here. You need to check out the oojs repos (gerrit.wikimedia.org:29418/oojs/core.git & gerrit.wikimedia.org:29418/oojs/ui.gt), make changes there, and once they are merged create a separate change which updates this concatenated file. Then you can rebase onto that change.
I'm using vbscript, all that does is reverse the setting of checkbox.checked, whichever way it is. As an aside, vbscript is awful to work in.
This is not the answer but I figured out a very sad workaround. Extend the TextView component class In the constructor of the subclass, fire off the code ...yuck
this should be done (if any) when first connection is established. and I do think that it is a mistake to do so. please move all the engine variables into engine side, do not modify options, there is no technical need to do so. this includes the destination address and destination port. let's makes lives easier for us. if you call the variable the same, you can even have same file symlinked at /etc/ovirt-engine/engine.conf.d and /etc/ovirt-engine/fence....conf.d/ to provide the same options. So you can even consider putting it at engine local config. But please avoid complexity result from database updates, and move the variables to the component that actually use them.
Heroku is an excellent (free) option: Also, deploying to Heroku is as easy as it gets!
On the WordPress repository is a plugin called wp gcm. Its a really great one try it out!
I'm trying to compile code that I know to be working on other peoples' machines but is throwing a particular error on my system. Specifically the error relates to the printf() method The method printf(String, Object[]) in the type PrintStream is not applicable for the arguments (String, double) For instance Does anyone know why this error is cropping up? There are alternatives to using printf(), but this is very annoying!
@Kevin Oh, excellent! I see now that it's a fairly obvious answer, but that tool is perfect. Thanks!
Hi Mehdi, you are right. I am very sorry - I have misinterpreted the deviceRuntimeVersion as the version of DeviceRuntimeOnHostMachine.
heuristics should check tvb_captured_length first to make sure there is enough data to run the heuristic, otherwise it might throw an exception just checking, and prevent subsequent heuristics from claiming the packet appropriately
That worked excellent! How can I make my X-axis go longer to right so it makes the chart bigger?
machine_emergency_restart is a good place for the cache flush in the sense that it is already machine-specific. But yes it's fine to take this approach. LGTM
Sorry for that.
I'm not sure that the given approach will work with hosts using NPT/EPT.
I am working on an opensource app that using SubSonic 2.0.3 I need to regenerate some of the code so I need the tool that does that. I cannot find this version 2.0.3 of the code generator executable. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I am currently a college student and I don't feel that any of my classes have touched on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) nearly enough. I've been interning a company for a few years and I've been learning about SDLC from the internship, but I wanted to poll the crowd so I can branch out from that. What SLDC resources (books, websites, magazines, newsletters, etc.) do you use?
I have a VB.NET MDI WinForms app. My users have been complaining about form creep (as they call it), this is where each time you open a specific form within the main MDI window it opens slightly below and to the right of the location it loaded previously - i.e. it starts in the top left of the window and works its way down to the bottom right. I have to agree with them that this is extremely irritating, is there any way to prevent this? The code to load the forms is: I can address this somewhat by setting the forms start-up positions to 'Manual' but then they just open directly on top of each other in the top left of the screen. Any other SO users come across this?
So my line extends from one side of my graph to the other, but it doesnt really animate through each data point, I assume I have to add a loop somewhere. Heres the relevant code. Any assistance would be hugely appreciated!!!
Hello Thanks a lot! It works. Lisa
This can't be here, since it only executes on the first CMake run, making LINEAR_ALGEBRA_LIBRARIES break on subsequent runs.
I have never parsed ini files, so I can't be too specific on this issue. But i have one advice: Don't reinvent the wheel as long as an existing one meets your requirements Good luck :)
I generally prefer not to be credited in source files.
I'm trying to test if a character in a string is a space, and I'm getting extremely frustrated: I'm not getting any errors and I've looked online, but people on different forums say this is how to test for a space. Uh.
Why this special case? It did not exist before and all it callers seem to take it from a tvb (except for a hard-coded 2000 in EnhancedAlarmMessage, which seems wrong too as the length is not checked there?)
Could you break this down for me? This looks scary :O
You are right. See my update! Make a suggestion pls and I'll catch your thoughts ;)
s/VURTI/Host Monitoring It is about to change soon.
When querying from the database using Entity Framework, what exceptions should one catch and what should be done about them? Generally I use because I have no specific action or feedback for every possible type of error, but I am constantly reminded that this is a terrible idea and that specific exceptions should be caught and handled! Example: What are the standards/guidelines for handling EF exceptions?
This is very fine :) Note that if you do the following: Only the first element of the array will be initialized with the non-zero number whereas the rest will be initialized with zeros.
Wow!
Loved Dan's solution! For python3 do:
Wow, great link!
Damn time has flown...
I meet the same problem on Eclipse recently but haven't figured out how to get through.
Please use org.eclipse.emf.compare.internal.utils.ComparisonUtil.isDeleteOrUnsetDiff(candidate) instead to also get the intended behavior for multi-valued attributes and unsets.
I don`t think that this could really happened. Because ptlrpc has single thread for rq_set, that means only one ptlrpc_check_set() could happened for a request. And ptl_send_rpc could not race with after_reply.
The value is having an ABI compatible way to pass the proper information to ramstage from romstage. There's no reason to allow something that can change to break in the future. Take for example the current different sizes of the previous space reserved in the cache_as_ram.inc files. Things that are brittle will break. What is the bare minimum amount of info that needs to be passed? Isn't it just a bar and a couple of endpoints?
@CalebHuitt-cjhuitt: Excellent â that works! Thank you very much. If you'd like some brownie points, please submit it as an answer and I'll mark it as the correct answer.
Why does the test return false?
This looks simple and sweet to me.
commit.hashCode() should be sufficient. A commit can only have one author.
Patch Set 5: > David - it used to be that you needed to land both the > stable and the 9999 cros workon ebuild at the same time. > Has that been fixed and you can just land the 9999? That's right, you only need to land the 9999 now. (Actually it's been supported since at least Oct 2010, but yeah there used to be a bug)
That `#define n 10` is scary :( Are you sure you don't intend on using that letter anywhere else?
Excellent question. IMHO this type of thinking makes programs much more robust, especially when they undergo constant change.
Can anyone think of a quick, easy and fullproof way of listing only ClearCase Remote Client views from UNIX? ct lsview obviously lists all the views, and you could search by looking at the Properties: section if you run a ct lsview -properties -full (gives you Properties: snapshot webview readwrite) then use a regex or something, but I'd be worried that someone calls their view 'webview' or something. Has anyone got a foolproof way? Am I missing a flag or something? If only there was -fmt on lsview :S
sorry :)
Excellent! Did you know that you can answer your own question and accept it as **the** answer. This is considered a good practice, because it helps people looking for answers see that there is an answer and it helps them find the answer. If the answer is only in comments, the question will appear unanswered.
Sorry attached the file to the wrong issue.
Work-around (horrible horrible invasive work-around) I got around this by subclassing UIApplication to track all screen touches. By holding on to the last touch location, I can, in the delegate, map the location to the link to determine whether or not it should be considered valid: MyCustomApplication.m (use it in main.m) And map it...
I have two tables which looks like this: Each news can only have one tag. What is the most effective way to handle inserts to the news table? The Tags table has like 50 000 rows. I'm only doing bulk inserts of approx. 300 news at a time, around 2 times per hour. I assume that i need some in-memory cache for the tags? If the tag is not in the tags table, i need to insert it and set TagID to the newly inserted id. Hope you'll get the idea!
How come this is considered programming related?
(style) why not format this normally, as is already done in functions below? ptr = (char *)update + cfs_size_round(offsetof(struct update, u_bufs[0]));
It would be super great! if you can help me with iframe and cookies stuff... data.message contains URL
In the latest patch, you switched from glib memory to wmem memory. So you do not want to call g_free but you still want to destroy the hash table itself, otherwise you are leaking memory. So switch to g_hash_table_new instead of g_hash_table_new_full and put back the call to g_hash_table_destroy.
Excellent question and I agree, it should be throwing an HTTP Not Authorized status.
This is extremely unsafe! Use `mysqli` or `pdo` instead of `mysql_`.

I knew about the _viemurc/.viemurc file, but I didn't realize you could map commands to VS ones with vsc. Very good tip!
@JonesV excellent! I think thats what I wanted: "//*vptr is address of first virtual function in VTABLE viz. display()"
You don't need to put this xml or a new test class. That means in a previous test case you can just do following: @WithProperties({ @Property(name = "webApiUsage", value = "resistance") }) public void testAnimationImpInResistanceMode() { // your test code here }
Instead of malloc() maybe you can use stack: gchar tmpname[41]; 41 is enough? Cannot be greater?
Is there a VB6 equivalent to the C/C++ 'continue' keyword? In C/C++, the command 'continue' starts the next iteration of the loop. Of course, other equivalents exist. I could put the remaining code of the loop in an if-statement. Alternatively, I could use a goto. (Ugh!)
Replace with a constant or use String.format("$0 $2",icon.getLocaion(),e.getLocalizedMessage())
I'm trying to create a grid (matrix) of squares in a given area with n columns and m rows, and an option to set a spacing between the squares if desired. The grid should fill squares with random coloring. I'd also like to add a zoom function, so the colored squares will appear much bigger in a region that is double-clicked. Can anyone suggest a good method to generate the grid and assign random colors to the squares? If you can suggest how to create the zoom effect too that would be SUPER :) I'm new to canvas, so any method help would be great! Thanks
Its absurdly late/early so maybe I'm just tired, but can anyone tell me why in the world the following test is not failing? Really need a second pair of eyes to confirm I'm not crazy...now I'm worried that all my tests are unreliable.
And debugging is hell because the test environment needs to have the exact same loader setup.
The histograms themselves don't use multipoint storage. The input for them often would be, but in this case it isn't.

You can look at OpenOffice Base. I tried it out awhile back when it first came out and it seemed awfully slow and it didn't seem feature complete either. But it is free and open source :o)
This code, RefreshLabelImageJob and PermissionAuthoritySessionManagerListener could be encapsulated in a single class whose responsability is to manage lock decorations update. And this class could be named LockDecorationUpdater, like that this class could be reused for potential others views.

The (NLTK) is an excellent resource if you're considering Python as a language. It incorporates lots of the stuff you'd expect in a text processing/NLP environment like parsers, stemmers and part-of-speech tagging. Documentation on it is pretty good too. As for datasets, NLTK comes with a variety of for experimenting with. Hope it helps, B.
I think I have addressed this in the updated version too.
Version 2 of contains a debugger. And it works awesome! It is still in very early stages, but have helped me several times. Just watch out for bugs! :)
I don't have resources to hand to test this at mo.
This is pretty trivial just adds three asserts to TestPath#testNormalize.
If I am using IIS 7.0 + Server 2008/Vista Enterprise, any ways from IIS 7.0 side to control the upload speed? For example, max upload speed at 1M bytes/second? Any configuration based easy solution is great! And any programming based solution is also appreciated. :-) thanks in advance, George
I feel like these explanatory comments belong in the code, not just the code review.
Hi Gregor, Need to make this accessible by adding "class='accessible-hidden'" with relevant details to labels; also add spans for hidden text; anchors with spans; buttons need to have "alt" text; etc. Please refer to: https://wiki.mahara.org/index.php/Accessibility for more details. Thanks, Ghada
So, it is as simple as purchasing a domain name, and then adding that identifying information to the hosts file? If so, that is excellent!!
This should probably be ignore. It is not part of the explicit ITK style specification.
cbk->mask will only contain bricks where the request has been sent. A read will never have a bit corresponding to a brick being healed on cbk->mask set, so the & is not needed. However, for writes (that also send the requests to bricks being healed), doing the & will cause that bricks that were unhealthy at the start of the operation will be marked again as bad after completing the operation, even if the operation succeeded. I think this is not correct.
I got it.. this is incredibly silly question! Static means I just access it directly from Without using it from the instance.
What's the easiest static (non-animating) 3d model format to load with Java? I used .obj in C++, but that's a pain to do in java. Is there anything better?
My company currently use CruiseControl.NET, which I find quite a pain on the neck to configure. What CI solution do you use?
This doesn't do any correctness tests of the file, while a start that they exist, I could just be touch'ing files.
I tried the new bootstrap 3 package - it is really great! Now I want at least a 3 level navigation and adapted lib.navigation.main in the setup: Unfornately the menu is not working correct (3rd level entry visible, no flyout). I also included the paypal-accessibility-plugin...
I don't care about the number of instances of ReferenceIndex. I want to have this cache inside BackendUtility::explodeSoftRefParserList() which is static.
Short and to the point... excellent! +1
Its probably better to include this line in a {} block to avoid inadvertent errors while making any changes around this code block as well as to make the code clearer to understand.
Standard LAMP config. As the guy said below, I imagine the file is just not being delivered correctly or something. Just worried something is breaking for my users!
Excellent Answer, thank you!
Sorry that should have said fixed via HADOOP-4980 not 6980.
The usage of exception specification here is very bad! If any only exception is thrown, then the program will terminate. Imagine what will happen if that occurred in Slicer! Have you verified that not a single method usage can throw an exception of a different kind?
Here is addendum to fix (Sorry about build breakage)
Yeah, major documentation work in the next few weeks, so we can all use our time more efficiently when new or wasn't-paying-attention-then developers come on board. Today, only worried about completing the rc while not creating repeat work later! :-)

Yep I've been testing some stuff recently under Safari 5.1.5 (WinXP) recently and when you have elements with tabindex="0", all the elements EXCEPT links ( with "href" defined) are focusable. By all elements, I mean s, s etc. It's absolutely amazing for me from the accessibility point of view!
Hopefully this will provide some ideas as to how to adapt a timer based approach for your needs: If your needs are more sophisticated then a TThread based approach may be more appropriate. But whatever you do, do NOT resort to Application.ProcessMessages it will only cause you grief !
If this is never called - then we need to remove the method, it's signature in the header, and all call-sites for it (right?).
I'm very worried about the following screen. When i launch "Instruments" in Allocations mode, i see every image of my app adding to "Living". I really don't understand how it could be possible...
I have a series of UIViews inside a UIScrollView, and the UIViewControllers for those views are not receiving the touch events. If I take the views out of the scroll view then it works. I have enabled userInteraction on the views but it's still not working! This must be possible and I'd be really grateful if someone could point me in the right direction! Thanks, Mike
:) I've renamed ComponentColorProperty to be ComponentColorElement and RelationshipAggregation to TwistieAggregation.
Hmm ... this is quite bad.
We added this snippet to LocalSettings.php, with great success: Thanks!
sorry this bug is *not* fixed.
I generally prefer not to be credited in source files.
You are right, this won't work without the next patch (use DbGroup instead of LdapGroup), I will check again and I will probably have to merge both this patch and next one into one single patch.
sorry for your time.
Kernel Mustard link is now dead :(
That's clever, but the performance must be HORRIBLE. Not that I'm saying there's a better answer, just shuddering at the O(n^2) of it.
Damn !
My Nit Pref: eliminate if, just return the boolean evaluation.
we have audio_data_file and so this can be changed to that.
I just have to say this is a brilliant idea, love it! +1
I don't think we should let people modify a branch that they don't have access to, even if it is for a commit that they are replacing that used to be in another branch. Locked down is locked down, right? I see how it might be annoying to have to redo a change if you used the wrong branch the first time, though... Perhaps there is some Git magic that can let you do that painlessly?
Every time I download the ZIP file it is corrupted!
This is a Maven project, and Maven's default build directory is "target" (see also the .classpath file generated by M2Eclipse)
heuristics should check tvb_captured_length first to make sure there is enough data to run the heuristic, otherwise it might throw an exception just checking, and prevent subsequent heuristics from claiming the packet appropriately
s/importsSet/pkgSet/ should explain that this set is only needed so we can create an duplicate free pkgList

I'm starting my first Drupal project, pretty excited :) I have a question the project is a hotel directory site. at sidebar I have locations list (London, Manchester, Liverpool, etc..) and filter the hotels related on location click. So, how should I create these cities? Should I put them manually and give links manually depending on location id? or is there any better way to create this location list and linking filtering dynamically (via cms, or custom module, etc...) Appreciate advices!!!!
I see. Everything makes sense now. Thanks a lot for the excellent answers!
Awesome, awesome answer. Thank you very much.
This is an absolutely horrid wart in the API, but it's never going away.
Cool cool - thanks stack!
Sorting the hashes is also a possibility that I have considered. I'm a bit concerned about memory usage, but I'll worry about that later.
yes, that's the point: if it's a *designer* plugin, it needs to depend on designer, as in the other example. but this is a ui loader/widget plugin only.

I think this'll be what I'm going to go with. I really hate dealing with XML files.
Be prepared that these logs won't show up. At least they don't on my Windows machine. Seems like logs outside the test itself do not appear.
In general, this is a _terrible_ idea. C++ headers are not intended to be included in an alternately namespace as was used here.
Faststrings is leaps and bounds faster than the normal Delphi StringReplace function. I really hope Peter releases a new version for Delphi 2009.

This doesn't work properly when the index is negative (e.g. time is before the offset).
We are now 2 years after migrating to TFS. Just upgraded to 2013. The team absolutely love it and can't even think about the old svn days!
though I disagree with a signficant amount of statements you madeI don't think we would ever come to agreement anyway.
The change here reminds me that also some of the new oc..._MS opcodes may need an entry here. Could you take care of those in a follow-up patch?
Oh fuck :-) Sorry. Not my day more beer needed!
@Chris Two different control statements just to appease developers who want their switch statements to work in a slightly different way? That's a **terrible** idea. VB [had that mentality for loops](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Visual_Basic/Loops), and it

Try <% if(ViewContext.ViewName == "Index"){%> Should work fine !!! EDIT : REMOVED IN BETA1 Removed the ViewName property from the ViewContext class.
Excellent! I'll try that. Hmm... I cant upvote yet, otherwise I would have :)
Flow control keywords must be followed by a single space
We kept this in r46 to keep some minor behaviour consistent. By omitting this in r50, we are actually keeping the behaviour of rc and final consistent, modulo the bug fix - see this function in git diff 53fc9d0 -- src/gromacs/mdlib/coupling.c. Since the r50 tests are already generated with the new RNG, we should expect those tests to continue to pass.
I guess the big question is whether it is sufficient to test the functionality by mocking out getaddrinfo() or if we need to actually make the call. If the former, I think it could go in UT. Lets see what others' say.
Indeed, thanks. I discovered this myself early last week, and addressed it in I82ff6602af3bf5 so that we use gcc 4.9.3 on slaves where that matters. Love these commercial-grade compilers!

That's too sad :(
This can't be here, since it only executes on the first CMake run, making LINEAR_ALGEBRA_LIBRARIES break on subsequent runs.
This is a great question.. my approach for solving this question would be to ask: Given a list of items, what is the popability of choosing two consecutive items from the list which are sorted. As the list becomes more sorted, the probability will approach 100%. To calculate this probability is relatively simple: I hope this helps!
The built in ones are awful. You can easily write your own RSS, RDF and ATOM parsers. I have a tutorial and a full visual studio project you can download that does just that http://www.jarloo.com/rumormill-5/
I think we only support mysql, sqlite, and postgresql in the migrations. (Mysql doesn't need this step because it stores indexes in a namespace per table. This step is only necessary in postgres and sql because index names are in a db-global namespace.)

I just launched with a stack of new features, including the MP Spotlight you can see on the Homepage Every few seconds, the following code is run, which goes and fetches the next MP and fades the old one out and the new one in. Looks great! BUT If you scroll down to the bottom of the page, and wait till the MP spotlight refreshes, the browser scrolls back to #memberList Does anyone know what's causing this? How can I stop it from scrolling? Any help is greatly appreciated.
This is weird.

Gosh ! you're right !!! Excellent !!!! Is there a way to expand it programatically ? I added .setOngoing(true) (to the top) but it's not expanded... (not really the top because the first one is a notification when I'm plugged to USB for tools developpement ). Thank you again my friend !

Sorry about that.
I found this about wrapping strings using parens extremely useful, but is there a way in Vim to make this happen automatically? I want to be within a string, typing away, and have Vim just put parens around my string and wrap it as necessary. For me, this would be a gigantic time saver as I spend so much time just wrapping long strings manually. Thanks in advance. Example: I type the following text: Vim automatically does this when I hit column 80 with the string:
WARNING: Code after RETURN statement cannot be executed
Same remark here. Please write here why this routine does it.
This is not the answer but I figured out a very sad workaround. Extend the TextView component class In the constructor of the subclass, fire off the code ...yuck
The if condition will be true when isDetailsRequired() == true and volumeName is empty. Will it work? Do you need to add a validation against this scenario?
It's a nice feature; does it cause a particular problem?
Ho yes, perhaps I should change the commit message ? It's because the policy was set to NEW, so it will do nothing anyway, as we are already using cmake > 2.6.0
cbk->mask will only contain bricks where the request has been sent. A read will never have a bit corresponding to a brick being healed on cbk->mask set, so the & is not needed. However, for writes (that also send the requests to bricks being healed), doing the & will cause that bricks that were unhealthy at the start of the operation will be marked again as bad after completing the operation, even if the operation succeeded. I think this is not correct.
that's sad:-( I don't need it for debugging, I need it for other purpose.
Excellent, thanks!
should the version be changed now that some methods are not available?
Thanks Adrien for looking into this nice explanation!
Could you add a quick comment, something like "Return any uncommitted resources"? It took me 2 minutes to figure this out even though I know most of this code already.
Stefan, I'm just mostly replicating the what is done when including CSS styled content's TS using the include static select. To me your questions show you did not look at the issue. Can we please get this through? Apart from the above, no there is not a filename, and yes there needs to be a slash.

This isn't C. Stop comparing it with C. What you are doing here with the brightness is just redefining the same thing. Both boards you touched have the same definitions for the brightness, \DSPC.BRTU and \DSPC.BRTD, so it makes limited sense to redefine them as something interim.

mw-mf-overlay-header seems like a rather meaningless class name. I wonder if we should move away from it to something more meaningful?
Indeed your question is an easy one, so I answer your question with some additional points that I think help you more than the answer itself:First, this is the code: Notes: Please1 - don't a simple problem a real hard one! if it's a hw you can convince the tutor about defining the string delimited with something like "," (if he/she insists) or whatever, and if this is a real project convince the customer, you don't want to torture yourself! 2 - you said you want to split the string into a 4 x 4 matrix, what if you want a 5x5 matrix? So take advantage of constants, and the same for the delimiter Hope these help.
It adds more things to go wrong than just downloading everything again to do a reinstall. I understand the desire, downloads are a pain, but downloading again is a much more predictable zero state than some set of possibly-correct archives on local disk checked against some possibly-correct set of hashes. All of which is a lot of extra moving parts to work around a problem (slow connections). Is it worth it? Maybe. But it is a lot more to go wrong.
My bad.
This serves me right for browsing s.o. on waking up. My eyes hurt!

Good Morning, I'm using SharePoint Designer 2007 to create a workflow for a MOSS site I have created. What I'm looking to do is have the workflow send out an email if a document in the library hasn't been modified for the past 30 days (and it's Status field is not set as "Closed"), but I'm stumped as to how I can do this. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
Hi, Correct me if i'm wrong - but, we have 2 instances of commands in the flow you described. This means they do not share state. The change done by Arik adds messages on the canDoActionMessages() collection of each one of the commands. Not sure how you're going to have this mix.
I am working on a test application based on ASP.NET MVC. I am new to CSS stuff so I am learning that as well. I have created a master page called "new.master" and created a new css "new.css". I am calling the view from controller as: What I am doing is that I am frequently updating the css and master page. So I run the application in debug mode frequently. After sometime I stop seeing the effect of changes in css. When I "view source" in chrome and check the css, it shows an old version. When I change the name of both master page and css, I start to receive updated views but that works for sometime and then again I stop getting the CSS updates. Have you faced this problem? How can I fix it? (Its terribly annoying!)

In netbeans, if I select some text and press , it works correctly and the text is indented to the right side as expected. But if I then try to backspace behind the text, it only removes one space at a time. Very annoying.

Any progress on this one? To embed complex functionality (including history-aware interactivity) on an MVC page without involving the rest of the page is a reasonable and common desire. The only alternative I see, to require the using page to track each components query-string state, is horrible.

That's funny, this is exactly what I am attempting to figure out the best way to do at the moment.

I had a memory crash on UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext() ... if you're creating and releasing a lot of them, you should wrap them in a fresh AutoReleasePool for each iteration.

Excellent, thanks for reporting back!
It looks like this allows a user who cannot see all branches to probe which branches exist. By looking at the error message "it doesn't exist" vs. "user does not have rights to delete it." a user can detect if a branch that is not visible to him exists.
I'd say spike should be part of the iteration plan. not just in time. They should be accounted for the story they belong to. Even reading of parts of the manual should be estimated. And now for the hard part: don't be afraid to give high estimates. Realistic is ALWAYS better than too low. ;)
I was intending on use the Title attribute in the @Page directive to customise each pages title, but it simply doesn't appear to do anything.

I've already got a workaround in place, but it's annoying the hell out of me, so I'm determined to find a resolution!
The value is having an ABI compatible way to pass the proper information to ramstage from romstage. There's no reason to allow something that can change to break in the future. Take for example the current different sizes of the previous space reserved in the cache_as_ram.inc files. Things that are brittle will break. What is the bare minimum amount of info that needs to be passed? Isn't it just a bar and a couple of endpoints?

I am new to Delphi (been programming in it for about 6 months now). So far, it's been an extremely frustrating experience, most of it coming from how bad Delphi is at handling dates and times. Maybe I think it's bad because I don't know how to use TDate and TTime properly, I don't know. Here is what is happening on me right now : That's not the exact code I use, everything is in variables and used in another context, but I think you can see the problem. Why is that calculation wrong? How am I suppose to work around this problem?
Hey sorry I did not get back to you sooner.
Put this into a DEPS variable and reuse the value above in gwt_module() too?
Whoops, just realized something...there's no way for me to specify a max length when using String.String(sbyte*) which basically means death to using the constructor for the purpose of reading out of a ring-buffer since it could keep reading past the max length into the next segment!
This is bad.
You should really take a look at sprox ( ). It builds on RESTController, is very straight forward, well documented (imo), generates forms and validation "magically" from your database and leaves you with a minimum of code to write. I really enjoy working with it. Hope that helps you :)
This is the line which triggers the crash. createQmlObject() requires the calling context to be valid. If this callback is invoked from C++ via the event loop, it has a chance to crash. Note that using Damian's repro also uncovered a crash in QNetworkAccessFtpBackend::closeDownstreamChannel() which could hide the crash issue in QML, but that's a separate issue which needs to be tracked separately (the fix is trivial, just a null ptr check on the ftp ptr).

I really have no idea what do past this: If someone could show me an example how how to get DevicePresent and how to use WriteKeyId I would be very greatful!

i love those 8-space tabs you are using....very sexy.
Sorry I've been MIA on this issue.
Back in the day I had to solve this with a panel where the text box is a component inside and had DockPadding set to 3 or 4 pixels. I'd then style that panel to a single pixel. I always found this really annoying!
This answer is not optimal because I have no clue which Konrad you are referring to.
Thanks for the answers. I've found a great sitemap generator over at codeplex. If anyone is interested you can check it out here: Enjoy!
Should we set "io->ci_ignore_layout = 1" under such case? then subsequent layout processing can be ignored.
ahh got it. you didn't downvote me for simply asking you to explain a bit more did you?
Recently I've started Operating Systems course...now going through its contents I'm thinking about learning UNIX from its internals.Also I have completed a Computer Architecture course and really loved it.Can you suggest a good book on UNIX Internals from which I can learn the practical aspects of how the architecture designs work in a real life OS?
Thank you @Ward! We're loving how easy it is to create the GUI with Breeze! If can just work out this part, we will have a great solution!
That just doesn't seem right, ones created by a call to generate_key are trivially generated and not imported. If we're at the point where this code is lying to you then the app can't trust the ORIGIN tag regardless.
Nobody answers here..sad!!!
Sorry I see that you say the same Mike :)
The was a pretty awesome read/reference! Although there are some typos, etc., it is really extensive and has tons of examples. C & C++.
call the function, pass the device also into the function
The effect I believe you are seeking is achieved by providing a HeaderTemplate for the TabItem's in you Tab collection. Hope this helps!

That answer was extremely helpful Scott, thanks for the pointer on that!
How does one make M-( the default behavior for typing an opening "(" character? I want Emacs to automatically insert the closing ")" after the cursor when I type a "(" character regardless of whether it's part of an M-key combination. Additionaly, I want to extend this behavior to quotes, subquotes, brackets and braces. Typing M-( is a pain, and there don't appear to be any comparable forms for those other characters.
Agree, (it was not added as part of this patch, but I'll fix it). Hopefully we'll be able to completely get rid of these parameters...
Its amazing 1000+ questions tagged "programming" I just had to go find out how many quesitons were tagged "question" and there are some!! @Jon: FYI, SO is always about programming, non programming questions will very quickly get voted closed.
There's always the poor man's alternative of just loading a bajillion individual frames as .gif/jpg/png and having javascript display them in sequence. It would be absolutely horrible for bandwidth and memory usage, and of course no audio, but it would (somewhat) simulate video being played. Of course, on Windows platforms, you could use ActiveX and/or embed media player and play avi/wmv files as well, without ever touching flash.
If I delete this question will it increase my reputation? 5 down votes it really sad.
where size is not the issue, and performance is not a big deal like in test, please use range() to mainatain future compat with python3
First guess: something's getting confused about reversed-ness.
sorry this bug is *not* fixed.
Please contact me if you need any clarifications.
If you know of a way please describe it.
The samples you gave are different.
Then you should be more specified in asking the question. You confused me..
If it wouldn't have been a programming question, The answer of your title would be Priceless :)
@Raubi: Which bit? It's still going to be horribly inefficient for long sequences, as it's still doing an enormous amount of string concatenation.
Is this valid ? what I'm really worried about is can you specify type and also use def at the same time?
wow this is really awesome! thanks for that @petert
Yuck, I really hate that option 2. But option 1 is the way to do it. +1 for option 1.
Sorry it seems I forgot a few references to 2.0.2 in ./deps/cxf-all I'm attaching a new patch to fix these references.
Unfortunately some projects require hundreds of images for CSS, general site images and flash then there can be hundreds of PDF's, Docs which are needed for the site. Including them can mean it takes ages to load a project and sync it. If your unlucky enough to use VSS then this is far more painful.
I think you could use a better method name, something like network_id_cmp for example
Great work...this is awesome stuff.
I'm not clear if "${workspace_loc:gitiles-parent}" mean "$WORKSPACE/gitiles-parent" or if it means "Path to the project named "gitiles-parent". When I changed the on-disk location (via the rename above) of my gitiles checkout (under my /src/workspaces directory) to /src/workspaces/gitiles-parent then I got to the next error. :)
But please don't say that my reasoning is bad - because it is not.
I am trying to make my javascript change when the window resizes, but cannot seem to get it to work. The only difference I would like is for the offset().top to change from -90 to -60 as the window becomes smaller than 768px. This is what I have so far: Any advice would be really great! Thank you

Don't set the `idx_type` for now, as it may also contain internal errors (I would leave the code path in couchdb for dealing with it though, so that I can add it later.

Yeah... I'm not a huge fan. Their documentation, tutorials, and guides are pretty nice. Here's the guide: https://parse.com/docs/ios_guide#top/iOS Here's the documentation: https://parse.com/docs/ios/api/ Here's the video tutorial for PFQueryTableView: https://parse.com/tutorials/parse-query-table (A little dated but very nice) Hope this helps! :)
Actually, it seems my comment isn't quite correct. Windows has strerror(3), and it behaves like you would expect... for the C library. The Windows API calls essentially have their own errno that is retrieved by GetLastError(), and these error codes are not the same as those used by errno, and thus use the gross API (FormatMessage https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa908810.aspx) instead. I'm not actually sure what to do with the logging API here, given that Windows actually needs two PLOGs... I'll update the comment either way.
EDIT: Also you should avoid using it can make debugging extremely frustrating.

Triggering quirks mode is a terrible, terrible, terrible thing. In quirks mode, jQuery is forced to use alternative methods to interact with the DOM and is almost definitely the cause of your speed issues in IE.
This is always a really bad way to design software.
I'd say spike should be part of the iteration plan. not just in time. They should be accounted for the story they belong to. Even reading of parts of the manual should be estimated. And now for the hard part: don't be afraid to give high estimates. Realistic is ALWAYS better than too low. ;)
Wide lines are a #@$# in most diff'ing tools as well, which can make code reviews a pain.
I would like to get back all the option selected of a multiple select when i submit my form. like : using somthing like that : and get an array with all the value selected like ['2','3'] All that, without jQuery and in js or php is fine :) thx!

I loved the wild solution that Marcus offered and it would be great if it could be undeleted!
+1 for actually *answering* the question.
This algorithm is terribly inefficient for small sample chosen from a large set. Picking 5 integers from a million takes one million calls to rand() instead of 5.
The biggest problem is that we've had too many committers over the years and we'd have to get all of their permission to change it.
Please forget last comment it is incorrect.
Sorry about the report.

I store ranges in MySQL DB, but a lot of queries to MySQL for getting provider name - it's terrible :(
Background: I'm currently debugging an application written over a custom-built GUI framework in C++. I've managed to pin down most bugs, but the bugs I'm having the most trouble with tend to have a common theme. All of them seem to be to do with the screen refreshing, redrawing or updating to match provided data. This is a pain to debug, because I can't break on every refresh, and most of this stuff is time-sensitive, so breakpoints occasionally "fix" the bug. Q: Does anyone have any tips for debugging Windows-based GUIs, especially regarding the refreshing of individual components?
Excellent work on that site by the way!
I got the idea for adding such a message from your change (only you had it even more verbose adding a message per approval that was copied). I can try to incorporate this into the patch set created message, but not sure if this is easily possible.
Excellent answer!
Good enough answer for me :) I get the same, lets hope they fix it soon because XBAP deployment I'm learning to love!
> I think it's cleaner. We do not have to re-implement and maintain different versions start-needed-srv in each script. Just one "vdsm_init_common.sh --start-needed-srv" to rule them all. Here we disagree. But we repeat our-selves... and not progressing, so we can stop doing that... and progress... as whatever we have now is much better than whatever existed before. When a user/downstream maintainer opens the service/unit/script whatever he expects to actually understand what happens there and why, and not start to dig within application to find issues and modify downstream specific logic. At upstart of have the start/stop convention (yeah... you need something for legacy sysv, but simple if is doing the work), for systemd you need nothing as it handles the dependencies, for openrc you need nothing as it handles the dependencies. So the discussion is entirely around the sysv scripts... I do remember that debian does have dependency management based on the header of scripts[1] So we left with rhel only to handle... This is why I do not understand why we need any common application downstream specific logic. [1] https://wiki.debian.org/LSBInitScripts
Thanks Myrna.
Very annoying, but simply solved! Reason is that by writing you tell ruby: I'm giving a block to this method call... And that's obviously not what you want. Simple fix: just add parentheses to your method call:
Hi there, I just moved from C#/C++ to JavaScript last night, and am loving it! I've just come across some behavior that I don't understand, wondering if anyone can shed some light on it?

So only workaround which works for me is to add this js to template of my site..But its really awful solution, since I only need it in one article/module
Kernel Mustard link is now dead :(
You have a potential problem here with MMCONF_SUPPORT. This option indicates hardware has PCI-e config register access in MMIO space in addition to the legacy 0xcf8/0xcfc IO registers. A second option MMCONF_SUPPORT_DEFAULT is not set, so by default you would use PCI IO config access. But since those are non-atomic, SMI handler in i82801ix explicitly uses MMIO and you have no MMCONF_BASE_ADDRESS set.

i would add a new variable with the tag name, this will make it so you can show which tags don't have any results
I realise this is probably an absolutely horrible way to do a query, and of course its not working. The point of it is to select users based on a date range and a keyword.
I have a controller which has a few actions, which are triggered by hitting various buttons on the page. I would like to have a default action, but am unsure how to annotate the method. Here is an example: How can I annotate a method which will act on a POST with any submit button pressed with no key selected? I have tried: I'd really hate it if I had to set required = false on each of the methods which take RequestParams and then conditionally check to see if one comes in or not... Is there a way to annotate this to work properly?
Great info! Thanks, Alex! :)
In this case, I'd keep the DoStuff() method but subscribe to it with: Admittedly that won't please those who do all their event wiring in the designer... but I find it simpler to inspect, personally. (I also hate the autogenerated event handler names...)
Kudos, great question!
The performance characteristics of ArrayList should be similar enough to use here instead of introducing JsObjectArray.
I'm working with a console application (C#) at the moment. What it does is pulls files from a database and stores them in their relevant folders on the C drive on a local machine. At the moment, every time I run the console app, it pulls ALL the files from the database. What I would like to be able to do, is each time I run it, It only pulls the files that were submitted since I last ran the console application. Currently, this is the linq statement that pulls the files from the database. Ideally I'd like something like the following where the date and time of the last run of the application is stored somewhere: I'm unsure on how to go about achieving this. If anyone had any advice on it I'd be very greatful :)
This is extremely ugly but I think it's what you're asking for: There are "workarounds" I guess.
I just flashed back to an old Broderbund game... Can't remember the name of it. Awful CGI graphics, lots of cannon battles in old ships... Maybe the first pirates game? Damn, that was an AWFUL game. Had a rollup scroll in it.
if a comment is behind the field it describes, doxygen needs "///<" (with a symbolized left arrow) to realize it correctly
Not to take anything away from the answer already accepted, but I was able to get the duration of an audio file (several different formats, including AC3, which is what I needed at the time) using the namespace. This is part of . Adding a reference to that made my code as simple as this... And it's pretty fast, too! Here's a reference for the class.
Same question on side-effects as on the previous file
This is probably silly but very frustrating. Using VS2008 with a C++ project, when I'm working normally, the breakpoints window is visible and active but when I'm debugging it disappears and can't be shown. This is a problem if I want to edit the condition of a breakpoint while running. Pressing the breakpoints window button doesn't do anything and neither does pressing Ctrl+Alt+B Does this happen to anybody else? It's a brand new install with Visual Assist and QT integration as extensions. same configuration with VS2005 doesn't have any problems.
I think we use spaces instead of tabs after variable name (all @foo above).
It looks like this allows a user who cannot see all branches to probe which branches exist. By looking at the error message "it doesn't exist" vs. "user does not have rights to delete it." a user can detect if a branch that is not visible to him exists.
Your best bet is probably TcpClient. There's a great sample that does exactly what you're doing right in the .NET Documentation here: Good luck to you!
Same caveat here about indexOf() and Search() results.
Why? Can¬¥t return $ -1.885,00?
I personally only use the 'm' and the 'p'. The rest is just zany in my view. It makes the code so darn hard to decipher. I did maintenance work on this guy's code who used semi-Hungarian notation type id prefixes on every variable, function, and other identifier in the code. He used $ signs liberally to separate words. It was hard to keep the murderous rage in check.
One of my tables in my SQL database has a growth rate of two nibbles per nanosecond. I was wondering how many megabytes per day that is and should I be worried? My hard disk is 150 GB.
The other day I noticed that if I run IEInspector's HttpAnalyser and capture the post data when logging into my bank account or amazon account the post data shows my user name and password in the clear. This is a little concerning. Does anyone know at what point the SSL encryption takes place? This I assume would mean that any software that is installed on your machine could potentially get access to this post data. Very scary.
functional changes?? I just flipped the ifs. But I just see that there's still the skipSystemDependencyCheck stuff in it.
I keep finding myself wanting to click on the link that says "Click image to edit". Can we make that part of the link?
i thinks that's the wrong one, the one that should be FROM is the "pl" library
@ThorbjÃ¸rn Ravn Andersen that's really great!
another note for future patch: replace static references by the proper Dao getter.
Yes. Actually, look at what I just merged to master with the query operators, in particular you might want to read the documentation in user-search.txt. You can write a query to identify changes that can be submitted: is:open CodeReview+2 Verified+1 -Verified-1 -CodeReview-2 If we put that string (minus the is:open part that would be implied) into your field, it means what you want it to mean... you can submit this only if the above expression is true. By making it a single string, all you need to do is feed the string from the table through the ChangeQueryBuilder to get a Predicate<ChangeData>, and then run match() on that to see if the submit is possible. That completely removes the FunctionState mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time. So the existence of that ChangeQueryBuilder and its Predicate support classes is why I was trying to steer you into a simple string here. We have the code already done to handle that as a string, and users can use the same syntax to search for changes as they can for controlling how we manage them.
The state stuck at "Allocated state" It is a dup of 3788.
OK this is really odd. I have a list of about 20 pairs of TV's that look like: etc, all the way up to 20 They all work fine but one. It although the names and order of the TVs are correct in both the template and the resource its displays in the location. I have tried clearing both ModX's cache and my browser cache but here is the result I get: The Template: The Resource's TV's: The result on the browser: If anyone can give me a hint as to what's going on I would be really greatful! Thanks
it seems to me that this operation is not optimal as it would try to find a number in a list, while you only need to check it against 0, 4095 boundaries.
don't confuse algorithm with implementation. env is not supposed to be used this way as it's touched from different places. it was said many times that using env to pass data between different codepaths is a bad idea.

Wow I frickin love this site! Thanks for the quick and concise responses. I plan to keep the client-side regex validation but move the username check to the server-side on submit.
isn't the client always linux? hmmm... client is a terrible name. i've no idea what i'm looking at here. i was planning on moving those files that currently have "client" in the name. there it seems to mean "device". usb_linux_client is the device-side code, usb_linux is the host-side code. likewise adb_auth. adb_client.cpp doesn't fit this pattern though --- it's a mixture? and for file_sync, client is the *host* and 'service' is the device.
although I feel incredibly stupid/angry or both
+1 for the sarcasm!
excellent, thank you!
The main thing about "Dev Mode Off" is that it works even when the code server isn't running. Perhaps it's less useful with this change, but I don't want to remove it yet.
Just put "Sync groups in these contexts only" as field text. And put the rest in a note beneath the text field: "Note: Leaving this field blank, the user authentication contexts will be used." Help needed to let admins know how they need to enter the context.

Not for me, but I can suggest some possibilities :It may cause problem while editing--> This can be solved by using some comments--> And then this will cause the code messier Some code may crash and your code success will go away from you |.|--> No solution - unless you know more about the code! Code upgrade problem-- If external code has upgrade you may have problem to know which is that code--> Again use comments--> And again messier So these are some that I can think about!EDIT---Some cons:You can make it more convenient to edit--> You can edit more than one code at onceYou can edit some code that you wan't able to edit (external resource before)--> Modifying is more convenient.You can make it load faster--> 1 file with 1000 KB is faster than 1000 files with 1 KB each.It is safer--> You don't need to worry about external resource being deleted!!These are my suggestions. Try to think more about it!

I have a gridview with rows that can be edited, inserted etc. I wrapped it in an updatepanel to give it an AJAX effect and update the system without reloading the page. I recently got into using jQuery and webservices for my AJAX calls and I absolutely love how it works and how fast it is. I would like to know if it is possible, and if so then how, to update my gridview using jQuery AJAX methods.
Excellent suggestion Aleksey! This seems to be a common need, so perhaps the Scala gods might consider adding this to Map
The "git commit" line needs a continuation character to include the following '-m' line. However, you should be able to fold the entire commit message into one quoted string starting on the above line. Be sure to leave the second line blank.
Note that the rtl:: prefix removal is planned to be done by a scripted change somewhen in the near future, so while this change is ok, it should be less work for both you and the review if you do not specifically aim for these changes.
Same caveat here about indexOf() and Search() results.
This is more like an invalid option, not out of memory.
I am currently a college student and I don't feel that any of my classes have touched on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) nearly enough. I've been interning a company for a few years and I've been learning about SDLC from the internship, but I wanted to poll the crowd so I can branch out from that. What SLDC resources (books, websites, magazines, newsletters, etc.) do you use?
@Brant - No worries!
You have a potential problem here with MMCONF_SUPPORT. This option indicates hardware has PCI-e config register access in MMIO space in addition to the legacy 0xcf8/0xcfc IO registers.

But since those are non-atomic, SMI handler in i82801ix explicitly uses MMIO and you have no MMCONF_BASE_ADDRESS set.
IMHO, we should explicitely add coverage for the method you're adding so we could isolate any problem later on

cbk->mask will only contain bricks where the request has been sent. A read will never have a bit corresponding to a brick being healed on cbk->mask set, so the & is not needed. However, for writes (that also send the requests to bricks being healed), doing the & will cause that bricks that were unhealthy at the start of the operation will be marked again as bad after completing the operation, even if the operation succeeded. I think this is not correct.
Let's imagine something like this: Later I can do something like this: Is there any way I can set the limit when using the named query, and not when defining it? I'd would really love to do something like: or Thx in advance! :-)

To be honest I don't even know where to start. I guess the solution might entail using a zillion IIf statements. I'm fairly new to this I'm afraid!
Thanks a lot Kiran for the patch.
It's scary that there is no way, but I must agree because it's fact.
I want to integrate the sweet sweet logo Andrew crafted.
If the string is boxed (ie. if the string is created in javascript new String("...")), it is no longer acts like java.lang.String in GWT lang. For example (aBoxedJsString instanceof String) will return false.
In my opinion this function is not required. ArrayIndexItems function can return one more array called counts (count for each entry). NewSecondaryIndexEntry() method can be added with one more arg count. During index inser, you just need to iterate through itms, counts := ArrayIndexItems() and encode as NewSecondaryIndexEntry(itm,count)

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved LGTM; and yes please do upstream.
Congratulations on the new job! Relax and keep your cool. Read something on . I guess, the process itself will make sure you are productive as long as you apply common sense :)
If it's not set, there's no way to get FSP failure data out. I agree that it's not an absolute requirement, but without it, if there's a failure, you're going to be pretty lost. We could move it from here and put this below, surrounding the #if statements and not actually fail, but my opinion was this was the best option...
Reuse the ChangeControl instance instead of loading the change again.
Could you break this down for me? This looks scary :O
thx for that, really great answer!
Read my comment regarding this in previous patch sets
Please use $GLOBALS['TBE_TEMPLATE'] here, so the code is more consistent
There is another way... As the WPF application is coded with the .NET framework, it is compiled to MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language). This means you can use a decompiler such as ILSpy to decompile and view the code of BaronReplays. This will give you some idea of how BaronReplays works so you can implement the same ideas into your own code project...Hope this helped!Rodit
i would suggest LG_MSG_INVALID_ARG instead in all the places

There are several articles on the Internet about developing elevated processes in Vista, but essentially elevation requests involve decorating .NET assemblies and WIN32 executables with elevation status in the application manifest file (may be embedded or side-by-side).

Sorry guys... :( I was the reason for this trouble.
I am getting very strange flickering on a WPF application of mine. It only happens with alpha blended content, only on my computer, and only with WPF applications. At least I haven't noticed it with anything else. It's really annoying! Has anyone else dealt with this weirdness?

Patch Set 1: Fails @Aske, really nice UI changes and the image GUI has improved a lot. One thins thou when trying to hide and element on a page which not has been published. An exception is thrown, maybe something that should be handled inside the PHP code instead.
The three tests above that checks namespaces should probably grouped together. They seems to be copy pasted and just change which setting is gathered. You could uses a dataProvider too. That will build an array of tests cases and pass the case to a test method. Anyway, you should extract the foreach / assert in a new internal method such as assertNamespaceIsValid()
I have a new responsive site I'm building and the site's header renders just great in all browsers except Internet Explorer 9. This puzzles me because I thought IE9 was more standards compliant. If I put IE9 in IE8 compatibility mode, it again renders fine. Any insight would be extremely helpful! I'm really stumped and perhaps it's an easy fix. Site Address: IE 9 Screenshot: Chris H.

You are going to kill me when I say this but it seems like we should just commit your first patch.

I have a controller which has a few actions, which are triggered by hitting various buttons on the page. I would like to have a default action, but am unsure how to annotate the method. Here is an example: How can I annotate a method which will act on a POST with any submit button pressed with no key selected? I have tried: I'd really hate it if I had to set required = false on each of the methods which take RequestParams and then conditionally check to see if one comes in or not... Is there a way to annotate this to work properly?

The CherryPick RESTApi acts on revisions (e.g. patchsets), not Changes. Just like the review RestApi does. Hence I don't think that it should go into ChangeApi. Look at the REST-url, and you will see it differs quite from the other RESTFul commands in ChangeApi. If you still want me to add it to ChangeApi, I can do that. But this is how I reasoned about where to put it.
Thanks for spotting this fixed at r487519

Not related, but may be better to move to constructPorperty(String suffix) or something like that.
This should probably be ignore. It is not part of the explicit ITK style specification.
An excellent book I have, which covers this topic, is , by Clifton Nock. It has got many good explanations and good ideas on how to decouple your business layer from the persistence layer. You really should give it a try. It's one of my favorite books.
It seems like calling Window.Location.replace() would reload the page? If it doesn't in this case, is that portable?
Why not just adjust the check upstairs to (m->total_size?:2048) > (microcode_end - (u32)c) then you won't need this check if you assume that cbfs is correct and if you don't cbfs check belongs to cbfs functions, not here.
Ahw... that's plain sad :(
Vineet, what you are trying to do is a terrible idea! If you ever find yourself having to engineer something as fundamental as that, take a step back and work out what else does it! I don't really believe in the whole spoon fed SO thing, but what mtwebster says is on the right track!
@SamDeHaan, you are correct! transposed them as i was writing.

I want to find out how long time there is till a specific from . I have searched everywhere, but can't really find anything. I THINK I have to use the -function together with the -function somehow. The scenario is: I have variable with the day of the week, ex: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 And another variable with a time of the day: hh:mm And the last variable also with a time of the day: hh:mm "How long time" could be like: "2 days, 3 hours and 27 minutes from now" The same output should be generated from a specific datetime. Ex: 06/08/2012 23:55 is "1 day and 13 minutes from now" I really hope you guys can help! :)

I have various files that I want to be ignored by SVN when committing. I know that I can go into TortoiseSVN and ignore them in various ways. I know that I can run svn propedit svn:ignore from the command line to do the same thing. The problem is that I have to have everyone on my team to do that, which is a pain. Is there a way that I can put some file in a folder or set something in my SVN repository that tells it to never check a certain file in?
we can actually allocate a 4K buffer which would be bigger enough to store the message.
P.S. - now that this is an attribute of the campaign, not an action, we need to change the i18n string to "Archived"

Is search and replace the only way to rename as asp control in the code behind file? I find this extremely annoying, but it is the only way I can find. Scenario: I'll find a variable that needs renaming (Usually to meet naming convention) I'll rename the variable in the aspx/ascx file. I'll have to go in the code behind files and search and replace. I get annoyed Are there any better ways - preferably that would not touch a similarly named variable in another scope in the project. I'm on VS2008 with resharper -- does VS2010 address this perhaps?
No, this is here by purpose to document that this is a static method, as that is not otherwise evident without looking at the header.

I have a .net assembly that has a COM+ ServicedCopmonent in it and at the moment I install it into the GAC to get everything working. This means that I need to have every assembly that it references in the GAC as well. During development it is quite painful to make changes to thes assemblies, re-install them to the GAC and then test. Is it possible to maintain the COM+ component but not have everything in the GAC?

Here, we are making a bunch of datastore calls in a loop, which could fail (or time out) and drop half of the updates. Since this is derived data and an async update is probably okay, a more robust approach would be to put tasks on the App Engine task queue to refresh each graph. Failed tasks automatically get retried. The most robust way to do the update: given a graph id, regenerate the graph from a query of all its dependencies, sort of like a makefile. Then, since it's idempotent, it doesn't matter if it fails sometimes, and we can ignore concurrency as well since multiple writes don't matter. (Incremental updates would be more efficient but trickier to get right, so I typically put that off until it seems necessary.)

I misunderstood the case and sorry for the confusion.
A unit test should do the same thing every time that it runs, otherwise you may run into a situation where the unit test only fails occasionally, and that could be a real pain to debug. Try seeding your pseudo-randomizer with the same seed every time (in the test, that is--not in production code). That way your test will generate the same set of inputs every time. If you can't control the seed and there is no way to prevent the function you are testing from being randomized, then I guess you are stuck with an unpredictable unit test. :(

Weird.
We should move this to some other module since it has very little to do with SIMD, and it was only a hack for a single architecture. However, that will require us to write a different hardware module, so for now I've added a define for GMX_SIMD when any of the SIMD architectures is enabled (which is good to have anyway).
Tried it, loved it. Using it right now.
I use and to embed the code formatting portions. Works great for me! :-) Sample page:
I understand you do this so that GF_FREE() under the out: label does not free the acl_xattr. The dict_unref() will call GF_FREE() already. Is there a need for GF_FREE() in out: at all? I think that only is useful for the error case when dict_set_bin() failed. It would be cleaner, and easier to understand if you do the GF_FREE(acl_xattr) above in the 'if (ret)' statements. There is no need for this 'acl_xattr = NULL' then anymore. If you do not like that approach (or if I missed something that makes it impractical), this 'acl_xattr = NULL' stetment desperately needs a comment.
That `#define n 10` is scary :( Are you sure you don't intend on using that letter anywhere else?
Could we have a single definition of such constants? :-) Perhaps some org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.StringConstants class?
Patch Set 2: Liron, so lets think: Reconstruct flow: Go throught all vds refresh and on case of some exception connect. Recovery flow: Go through all vds connect and after that refresh, no need for exception handling on case of exception at refresh. especially additional refresh. No need for additional method that u introduced. Where it is 99% percent common. You already introduced a method that at some flow should return only true and complicated a very simple code. "right now there is no need to copy the method in my opinion - 99%" - your change at connectAndRefreshAllUpHosts in order to solve bug at reconstruct flow caused to regression in recovery flow. I don't think that these means 99% common.
excellent answer!! Its very informative. Thank you.

None of the above is exactly what I was looking for, so I wrote one. super simple to use %B in the printf!
By the way, I agree with Henrik P. Hessel. This is a very horrible piece of code.
I far prefer the load/store naming since anybody who has ever worked with SIMD will know exactly what we're doing. The point is to maybe make the SIMD code slightly less cluttered, and _maybe_ make it possible to for some simple routines to be templated, not to design a new language.

If we agree to always treat a single number as JSON even if the client doesn't enable datatype support, then we can always set its datatype to JSON regardless of that.
what means "error_expected" = "create". It's means there are nor error? then it's better to use None by default for self.input.param("error-expected", None) and you set string in error_expected by default value is boolean. python allows it but it's not good to change the type of variable
I don't care about code duplication here.

Then you're pretty well screwed.
debug print but not errant, and commented out. i got tired of putting back every time i came to this routine.
Cool, that was going to be my next suggestion! Good luck :)
And here, end with a single "},", and the next line becomes "}},".
@IgnacioOcampo, I gave up after a while I am afraid :(
Please contact me if you need any clarifications.
i think you can use here getAndSetVdsStatic() to get the vds name, so we will have it in the log, i think it is called anyway for the logging infrastructure ("FINISH")
I need some drawings in my tableview. How can i do this. Any help will be greatly appreciated!!
I'm pretty familiar with PGP, and the way it works. I'd like to include some functionality in a project, but so far my research has left my head spinning. What I'd like to do is create a public key with a defined private pass phrase. From there, I'd share the public key with someone where they can then encrypt a message using the key and return it to me where I can decrypt. I envision the code looking something like this. To generate my private pgp key: To encrypt I'd give my shared key to a friend: To decrypt the encrypted string after being sent back to me: Obviously I know I'm skipping out on a ton of details. Through my research I've seen references to libraries like Bouncy Castle and Spongy Castle. Any help would be hugely appreciated!
Pull it back in if you think different.
I have reused some cmake code I had... It should be some left over from the copy-paste :/
There's an excellent guide over on the Android Training site: It's about efficient loading of bitmap images - highly recommended!
but stackoverflow is awesome!
this should better be moved to a signal in IWizardFactory then, I suppose. but different patch.
Two excellent answers, thank you! I chose Andrew's primarily because I learned a bit more about knockout from it, but both are good options. I'd use RP's method to get something to use in a more generic "anything can be chosen" scenario, but I think making it a single object is probably a better fit for my uses.
This worked for me.
Thanks for the patch Mubarak.
Is there a sensible way to group Long UTC dates by Day? I would Mod them by 86400 but that doesn't take leap seconds into account. Does anyone have any other ideas, I'm using java so I could parse them into Date Objects, but I'm a little worried of the performance overhead of using the date class. Also is there a more efficient way than comparing the year month and day parts of a Date object?
thatÂ´s really sad :(
Is this marked 'latest' in the other place it's defined?
Add newline. #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is this valid ? what I'm really worried about is can you specify type and also use def at the same time?
I really appreciate your comments and I really enjoy our discussions:)
This is device init path, is not it? So changing the od_track_declares after the fact would not retroactively enable this feature? We might as well change it to a module parameter then if this is the way we want to go?
This worked for me.
I have this script and been breaking my head on trying to change it so that instead of cropping the center part of the image it will crop from the top to the $height sent to the function, any help will be extremely great:
In VB.NET you can, with the keyword (I believe). But what you're trying to do seems really horrible. Just set them explicitly. It's almost exactly the same amount of code.
I'm still trying to understand what this new logic brings to the table...after all of this effort, we are still just enforcing that the project/tenant-id that created an entity (secret/order) is the same one that can perform operations on that entity. However, the database relationships used in the entity queries enforce this, so what does all of this do that is different? If we were doing attribute-level access control, it might make more sense to me, but entity level for tenant-id RBAC is redundant to the db queries to me.
`cat $(find $FOLDER -name "*.txt")` that's terrible!
if/when you figure this out - you definitely need to share it back to the world.. I'd love something like this!
@PhilipOakley excellent suggestion! I hadn't used `cherry-pick` before but that worked quite well. If you post as an answer I'll accept.
this rather looks like an IllegalArgumentException looks like we should check this earlier when setURI is called and already fail there if a URI is already set
Does anyone know how to add an item to a list but do it so it's ordered alphabetically using jQuery? I've got the following code that just adds an item from a dropdown to the end of the list: but I'd like to be able to insert it in its appropriate place instead of just appending to the end of the existing list. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks!
This example contains both actual examples ("refs/*") and metalanguage ("permission"). Maybe pick one representation and stick to it? [access "<ref>"] <permission> = group Administrators or [access "refs/*"] read = group Administrators (Open re what formatting to apply to metalanguage.)
I will remove all of the debug and most of the other messages after the VectorImage is working. Main reason to use the Logger is to print interleaved messages from multiple threads legibly. Other reason I'm avoiding debugMacro until VectorImage is working is so that I can continue to see debug messages even when compiled in Release mode for speed.
Hi Miklos, I have mentioned the relevant comments for this impacted UT in the commit message as well. Kindly have a look. Thanks.
Get Updated. Not that I'm that a Java Fan, but I'm working now with a Java Team and they do deserve the respect :) See comment by SztupY
I found this code (full version here ) It's work for me but now i don't know how to stop it (for making test it's horrible, my new php file not interpreted!)
Too slow and I prefer to operate in the same mode as my users. Also, I just really hate switching to debug. And its a waste of diskspace.
Use existing $GLOBALS['LANG']->sL('LLL:EXT:lang/locallang_core.xml:show_item.php.uid') with "Uid:" ?

I really hate regex in principle. can it be done in a plane script or something?

I would suggest changing the name of this, we actually use Neutron Drivers for spec reviews (confusing I know, given line 61 below). Since each of these has it's own review team, perhaps we can somehow indicate that here?
Or, if the check is needed, do you mind adding a comment about when this can be false?
Use spaces, rather than tabs, here, for consistency.
No. Note that what I write is not real and reciprocal space. Below the cut-off we have both the real space and reciprocal space contribution.
Vineet, what you are trying to do is a terrible idea! If you ever find yourself having to engineer something as fundamental as that, take a step back and work out what else does it! I don't really believe in the whole spoon fed SO thing, but what mtwebster says is on the right track!
Sorry I thought issue (and provided patch) were about cocoon-servlet-service-impl used by either C2.2 and C3 but only now I see that instead they are related to cocoon-servlet-service-components (C2.2 only).

Thank you for the excellent answers! @ArnoldSpence is correct: It is indeed a case of memory fragmentation. I confirmed this by modifying my example above to allocate a series of 49 MB buffers after the reaching the "OUT OF MEMORY" condition. Sure enough, these all succeeded (up to the 2GB limit).
to forget too.. Specific code for containers 1 and 2 edit parts

Has anyone seen a wordpress plugin slider that will show partially the next and previous image before it slides in? OR does anyone know of one that may be easily customized to show that effect? any demos, guidance or links will be extremely helpful! Thanks very much in advance! Michael
Why not level 1? We don't care about warnings in third-party code. Using level 3 could actually *increase* the level depending on the actual build flags.
All the msgs above have significance that they are trying to modify PGFID. Create one message id say 'P_MSG_PGFID_OP' and log errors there.
yeah it working fine :) Thanks !!
Apple's MapCallouts code sample demonstrates how do do this with the callout and their Weather Map sample shows how to do custom annotation views. There documentation is really excellent and these samples are both helpful.

If you instead put this into the gerrit-server directory, you can then refactor the AdminSetParent SSHD command to also use this implementation. That would reduce the amount of code needed to add this feature, since its mostly just extracting the existing code from AdminSetParent.

As title, basically I have a user control placed inside a page and then the page is placed inside the master page. I want to extract a block of javascript and put it back to the page head. When I try to wrap the code inside any block control (e.g. a div runat server) and access divID.InnerText then ASP.NET bust off with I dont want to extract JS inside cs file, thats awfully ugly approach (all sort of escapes and people wont even notice you have JS written unless they drill your CS file), what can I do?
(style) why not format this normally, as is already done in functions below? ptr = (char *)update + cfs_size_round(offsetof(struct update, u_bufs[0]));
Beaaaaaaautiful!
That is not about programing.
That would be really great if you share link to the example.
Last try.
Excellent work on that site by the way!
this must be count > CFS_PAGE_SIZE - 1, otherwise the kbuf[count] = 0; would overflow into the next page is the write is eaxctly page-sized.

All the other pacakages I need to install (acs, acs-node) give me: I really hope, someone can help me! I don't understand at all what is going on. I am installing nodejs from PPA: because the version from the Linux Mint repository are way to old. Any help very much appreciated!

Yes, as a number of the excellent responses spotted, it is (was) a homebrew fiber implementation - my first implementation of Flow-Based Programming on a PC.

I do hate the plain id name. I strongly prefer to always use the invoice_id or a variant thereof. I always know which table is the authoritative table for the id when I need to, but this confuses me What's worst of all is the mix you mention, totally confusing. I've had to work with a database where almost always it was foo_id except in one of the most used ids. That was total hell.
Why did you make this change? I think it makes sense to have the assertion.
Firebug is an excellent tool to to show a screen media CSS for some HTML element, but is there a way to look at the print media CSS too? Or is there any other tool to see the print media CSS?

I have already tried some funny ways to do this but did not succeed :P Thanks in advance.
The ebook summarises Thread.Suspend and Thread.Resume thusly: The deprecated Suspend and Resume methods have two modes â dangerous and useless! The book recommends using a synchronization construct such as an or to perform thread suspending and resuming.

Technically, XHTML can not be poorly formed. A stipulation of XHTML is that it is well formed and valid. Sorry for the lame comment, invalid XHTML angers me.
You are processing the newline character as if it is legitimate input. You should either read the entire line (including the newline, perhaps using a ) and then process the first character of the line or simply add a test to skip newlines in your loop logic.P.S. Converting case by adding or subtracting 32 is a really awful approach. It won't work with anything but a-z and A-Z (in the English alphabet). It won't work for most characters outside the Basic Latin block and shouldn't be used at all for characters that have no alternate case (such as newline). You should be using and instead.
Maybe name this installToDispatcher() or something like that? I had a hard time understanding all the different classes.

For SQL Server 2005, I ALWAYS had to install the full product first, then Express second. If I did it the other way around, the full SQL install would see Express installed already, and would not continue with the install. It was extremely annoying. Not sure if they fixed this with 2008.

I'm working on a huge application and the extra steps you mentioned were really pain in the ass for me. So I developed a small proxy class that handles class method bindings.

That's impossible to say until somebody invests the time and effort to try lots of different function approximations on that architecture to see if they can come up with something better. For now it is the fastest approach.
Well asp.net is problematic by itself in many ways. I can only imagine how the page is coded, but mostly asp.net submits are done in a very painful way through _doPostback where it sets additional hidden fields. You might want to try reading this and reviewing the generated html of the page
TableID is specified to be 8 characters. While the original version broke that by adding a space, I guess it's simply ignored. With this change, the final "M" would be dropped, too. (When you fix that, also cut OEMID to 4 characters, it's 32bit. ACPI5.0 19.5.28)

Because SQL migrations requires it for work on the ec2 credential table.
You have two divs, one over the other, and the one on top is transparent. However, when you scroll you want the div on the bottom to hide as it goes under the first transparent div. You don't want the second div's to change to as soon as it goes under the first div. You just want the part that is under to be hidden. I've googled extensively for an answer: #1-4 answer make the div on top or . The problem with this for me is my background is a photograph, i.e. as you scroll down what you see is different, as opposed to a colour or a pattern. The "background" of the transparent div needs to change as the real background changes. #5 offers a solution to this using JQuery however there are horrible, horrible issues with scroll lag in browsers not Firefox. Folks, how do I do it?
you handle all these exceptions in the same way so you can use multi-catch: } catch (RevisionSyntaxException | AmbiguousObjectException | IncorrectObjectTypeException | IOException e) {
Please place functions in <code></code> tags throughout.
The problem is that you never run the method, so the field stays at zero. It's a really terrible idea to give a field and a method the same name.
Wow that was exactly what I wanted! So the second solution I showed is somewhat similar to what he's describing but he describes also extremely elegant triggers that would keep all the data fully sane without any external code sanitization! I think I will go with that design!
Excellent! Tank you so much, much appreciated.
An excellent and elegant solution. Kudos.
Very cool.
I did it wrong this time.
Oh, you want it really obvious what type the variable is :)
You made an excellent point in a comment below, @RailsSon: you want to print Â£s to display a specific currency, but employ that display using a Japanese expression for financial numbers. I find it strange that your request hasn't been implemented in the language by decoupling the `locale` module's use of currency value and that currency's display properties.

Hopefully this will provide some ideas as to how to adapt a timer based approach for your needs: If your needs are more sophisticated then a TThread based approach may be more appropriate. But whatever you do, do NOT resort to Application.ProcessMessages it will only cause you grief !
My bad.
planning to do that in a separate changelist for MB-14866: 1. merge lock with seqno_list into the same structure 2. maintain a vbMap instead of vbList in this service, so as to make vbno lookup/validation faster 3. do vbno validation in all relevant places in the service you mentioned that we could use list of list instead of map of list to avoid issues with map. Feel that it makes the code harder to read. we may have to understandard the behavior with maps anyway. Plan to make the changes above and see if the issue in MB-14866 re-cur.
Committed a slightly cleaned up version of the patch in revision: 1464605 Thanks for your help Todd.
I have never use this but looks really great and pretty easy to use !
Found the culprit! At first I tried the solution suggested by @billinkc in the comment, it worked (I managed to create a folder) but the folder wasn't usable as I couldn't upload packages. I have db_owner permission on the MSDB database and so I can see and access the SSIS MSDB folder. What I really needed was the db_ssisadmin permission. Not to worry as db_owner permissions allow me to give myself the db_ssisadmin permission! After this was done, all the problems (the one in the original Q and more) disappeared.
@Suma How can this be a duplicate if the question you mentioned was posted a year after this one?

Consider merging these uncommon write barrier forms in to one function that takes flags. I think there's a bug in the later atomic function fixes that this would help address.
Excellent suggestion Aleksey! This seems to be a common need, so perhaps the Scala gods might consider adding this to Map
Extremely lousy solution.
I'm using Rob Con's repository pattern also - absolutely love it. But i'm not worrying about concurrency checks. I load the most recent object, then update the fields the submitchanges. I would look at seeing if you could use the Attach and/or timestamps. It's been a while since i've looking into linq + concurrency.
I would recommend -- it's an excellent CMS with great built-in translation.
This will always be nil, right? As above, I think you can remove this argument.
Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1 @Sebastian: Yeah we already discussed that, but since we don't have time to implement promises or similar for 1.0 it's still better than before. So for now we make sure to fetch the stuff early, but I agree we should add a TODO in there
Patch Set 2: Liron, so lets think: Reconstruct flow: Go throught all vds refresh and on case of some exception connect. Recovery flow: Go through all vds connect and after that refresh, no need for exception handling on case of exception at refresh. especially additional refresh. No need for additional method that u introduced. Where it is 99% percent common. You already introduced a method that at some flow should return only true and complicated a very simple code. "right now there is no need to copy the method in my opinion - 99%" - your change at connectAndRefreshAllUpHosts in order to solve bug at reconstruct flow caused to regression in recovery flow. I don't think that these means 99% common.
No prob. Good luck!
I always seem to use Get when working with data (strongly typed or otherwise) from the database and I have never really needed to use Fill although I just as easily could use Fill instead of get when pulling out and updating data. Can anyone provide guidance as to the implications and gotchas of each method? In what situations is it preferable to use one or the other? Any performance implications? Thanks in advance for the answers! I love this community!
We backed away from that. It is simply impractical. Too many tools and users use refs/for/ to remove support for it.
#ERROR!
So I'm trying to write a RR Rotation and LL Rotation with Java for an AVL tree. I have most of it figured out, however I don't know where I should modify the height within the method. I've been trying to understand it for a few days here but I cannot figure out where exactly it would go in the method I currently have. If someone could help explain exactly where I should put the modifications for the height of the node (it uses getLeft/setLeft for it's left height and getRight/setRight for it's right height) it would be extremely helpful!
oh, good catch! funny this slipped in ... btw: ArrayUtility from extbase should be reviewed and at first glance it seems most of it could be merged to core ArrayUtility.
Excellent article! Very useful :)
Maybe include a warning if the assumption is not met?
I am currently a college student and I don't feel that any of my classes have touched on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) nearly enough. I've been interning a company for a few years and I've been learning about SDLC from the internship, but I wanted to poll the crowd so I can branch out from that. What SLDC resources (books, websites, magazines, newsletters, etc.) do you use?
And boy hell broke loose ;) So... the biggest issue I'm facing is indeed with Random sharing across threads.
Excellent, thanks!
@Suma How can this be a duplicate if the question you mentioned was posted a year after this one?
Yep, StackOverflow is written in C#/ .NET and is a very successful example of a high-scale site.
Oleg please accept that my "logical" is different from your "logical".
When using sIFR on the titles (.content h1.pagetitle) in my WP theme, it somehow messes up the spacing and pushes the title down. The actual flash video is the same size as the font, so I think it has something to do with CSS, though I've tried just about everything I could think of and can't get it lined up properly. Here's a link to the site: Any help would be absolutely appreciated :) Sean
Method descriptions in VTK must always start with this: // Description: If this line is missing, then the automatic document generation will not work.
awesome explanation!! this is seriously awesome..
string.join() is deprecated. Please use ','.join(vmList).
Hey Piper, I saw you posting a lot of `git` questions tonight (which is completely fine!) but just wanted to make sure you were aware of http://gitready.com and the Git Community Book: http://book.git-scm.com/ which might help you with some of your questions. The community book even has some screencasts in it. Again, feel free to ask questions here... just wanted to pass that along to you.
Same here, toQt or just toVariant as it is taking a Json::Value.
Enumerating all partitions of a set is . Now, all permutations of all partitions of a set will be , although the example is a bit artificial. Now, to come up with a useful algorithm it's a totally different story. I am not aware of any such algorithm, and in any case its scaling will be absolutely awful.
Long Life MyFacesssssssssss!
No worries, Greg!
Cool will do! Thanks for the review and good questions... and the whole idea! :)
Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this Please fix the indent pep8 errors in gluster_cli_tests.py at least.
Your formatting is absolutely horrible to read. Could you fix that?
I think that this should be removed, and phdr->len and phdr->caplen needs to be incremented by 1 + 16 instead (see other comments below).
Thanks Bob your patch is in trunk at r932317
Beaaaaaaautiful!
I have been given a .Hive file from a registry which i have to parse and use the contents as part of a html report(from this i assume i have to convert to text somehow). The whole thing must be done within the program so i cant just convert the hive file and then run it through my program. I currently have no idea how to even start this so any help on this would be great. Any ideas would be fantastic!
Might be better to move this test to right after the docio_read_doc_key_meta call, since it's doing the error handling for it. If there was an error, there's no point in populating 'doc' and '*doc_offset', right?
does a similar thing (and yes, i find the 'pc' moniker for windows machines very disgusting)
This is quality work.
Wow thanks Raghu that's awesome and will save me a ton of time.
aaaaawesome!!!! Thanks a lot
here we are changing the default to 0666 but in open it is 0777, we should have only one. I think 0777 was chosen based on what python os module does, but could be wrong...
No need for indirection here. Merge benchmarkTCPConcurrentReadWrite into this function, and use the addr "127.0.0.1:0" directly.
There's always the poor man's alternative of just loading a bajillion individual frames as .gif/jpg/png and having javascript display them in sequence. It would be absolutely horrible for bandwidth and memory usage, and of course no audio, but it would (somewhat) simulate video being played. Of course, on Windows platforms, you could use ActiveX and/or embed media player and play avi/wmv files as well, without ever touching flash.
I was wondering if there was somewhere I could get some starter kit / theme sample for ASP.NET. I am not a designer, but I need to build a prototype for a project, and if I do it myself it'll certainly be awful Do you know where I could find that (ASP.NET specific)?
I think it should be optimizerCtx.getLastStepFor(NAME)+1, since the methods which are last modified by DeadCodeElimination are deadcode-free. Another concern is that when it is called by MethodInliner, actually we want to traverse the methods that modified by MethodInliner, not all the modified methods since last DeadCodeElimination. The result would be the same, but it may do unnecessary work in MethodInliner.
At least put // @todo something. Helps us keep track of what still needs to be looked at in the codebase.
how about use default wikitext namespace (see getDefaultWikitextNS below) or allow specifying namespace as an argument?
updated the answer. This might help you! Great! then you might want to edit the java program and have the permission specified while the folder is created did you try chmod with 777 permission via terminal or php?
I would like to rewrite in C++, but that requires all the calling programs to be C++ too. Will do that in a separate patch.
I hated using UML tools till I found http://yuml.me/ which offers some sort of DSL to describe UML diagrams. No mouse-fiddleling any more :-).
I have a big problem. I've created site, using jQuery, but it runs very slowly. On mobile phones it's terrible! And I don't know, what's wrong... Someone can help me? Links doesn't works yet, because I want use CMS on this layout, but before I want to little optimise these scripts. Here's test site: And here are the scripts:
Sorry db name is TPCDB user name TPC pwd whatever...
I'm calling onto some code that returns me an HTTP response. I can get the contents of the response which returns me a byte array. The bytes represent a zip file that I would like to extract and get the contents of a single file (the zip only contains one file). Currently I have some messy code (I'll need to clean it up if I keep it) that seems to work: but was wondering whether there was a cleaner way to do the same thing because the above looks incredibly ugly.
This doesn't do any correctness tests of the file, while a start that they exist, I could just be touch'ing files.
This could be done with a static const char* [] data array, using the enum value as an index. It would generate much less code in the end.
An excellent and elegant solution. Kudos.
I've noticed this lag time also. Its really annoying when you go to /usr/bin to tell firefox what app to use to open a file and it lags for 10 seconds.
problem - the bit to sign the source-release is being called when the source-release isn't being built because the source-release is only built at the "executionroot".
This comment doesn't sound right. This if statement should be removed as lapd_handle should already be populated.
They sure didn't @MichaelSzyndel . It's extremely frustrating. I am using the latest ver, too. I really would like to get it working properly.
@ergosys Thanks that was extremely helpful!! Somewhat related to what I asked... I'll have a try on that tomorrow :D
the condition !pProfile->m_bIsValid must always be true here, so rather use SAL_WARN
Thanks Hari!
I'm new to ror and am finding the scattered documentation extremely frustrating! When the commands rails generate model or rails scaffold are any fileds automatically created. I'm thinking here about the Id field in particular. Additionally, could anyone point me to the documentation which specifies this?
// _g_.m is reachable via allgs, so WB can be eliminated.
Thanks Amar!
That's depressing :/ Are you sure I can't get a collection of all controls on the page with a particular class and give them a single data source?
(style) remove empty line in middle of variable declaration, and convert few lines after to tabs
prefer to have variables as local as possible. This helps with long-term maintenance. for ( unsigned int i=0; .... { for ( unsigned int j=0; ... { } }
Applied @NonNullByDefault everywhere it was possible
thanks again Uwe
Wow, great! thanks, I didn't know this one existed.
was excellent :) However instead of creating a button object, I am only calling an OnTouchlistener to change the state of every view. Gives the same results though
durrrh that sucks.
A great explanation! Thanks:)
This is a stupidity of windows find utility, +1 for feeling my pain.
Also, is there any tutorials you would suggest for me to downgrade the .NET Framework for an already built project? That would be really great :)
this is a disgustingly horrible hack, but it might get the job done:
Excellent question! I know this is an old post, but it saved me on a big project I am working on... so, thanks!
I did not make comments on all of these before because it was the same comment every time. Unless there is a good documented reason, these should all be set to ignore.
Oh fuck :-) Sorry. Not my day more beer needed!
@KDJ It means the elements siblings whose ID's end in _dd, and no worries!
Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1 @Sebastian: Yeah we already discussed that, but since we don't have time to implement promises or similar for 1.0 it's still better than before. So for now we make sure to fetch the stuff early, but I agree we should add a TODO in there
I think you're right that this seems only natural. I will leave the code for this commented out by a flag for now, and figure out a way to add a 'lint' mode to JSORestrictionsChecker later to warn when turned on.
This might help you understand/explore things a little bit more. An excellent article! Cheers!
This should be rather initialized with an empty collection.
Great, don't forget to accept my answer by clicking the tick on the left!
You can add bitmasks to the hf_ item and still use proto_tree_add_item to get your desired effect.
Damn...
#NAME?
I use the gem for transparent usage of Memcached. Using the supplied config file it is enabled on all modes (development, test, production). Is there a way to only activate cache-money in production mode? It's not immediately clear how to do this, and it's a total pain dealing with caching in development mode.
That's one bit of excellent logic! Thank you so much!
The named scopes already proposed are pretty fine. The clasic way to do it would be:
// _g_.m is reachable via allgs, so WB can be eliminated.
This makes sure we don't have a bug where we silently drop object files
I can't parse the part between this comma and the next one.
You shouldn't check "_doc.length.bodylen == 0 && (iterator->opt & FDB_ITR_NO_DELETES)" again because we already checked it above.
Excellent advice, thanks!
I have no answer, but I'll 2nd the sentiment about the documentation quality for OpenSSL... I'm working with it now also (just starting), and it's horrible trying to find examples or documents for anything beyond simple operations... I feel your pain.
I stumbled upon this site and really loved the way they have done the navigation on the left hand site. I noticed that site is using jquery but didnt see any plugins. Any ideas on how to go about doing this?
That link is full of horrible advice.
([0-1 ]?[0-9]|2[0-3]):([0-5][0-9]) I think that's the regex you're looking for (not specifically for javascript though). This site has an excellent amount of info for language-specific regular expressions! Cheers!
I know I can configure command line arguments in the Run configuration but I want to run a java file multiple times with different command line arguments. It's a pain to change the Run Configuration every time. Is there a way I can make Eclipse prompt me for command line arguments every time I run the program?
Correct, I mentioned in the commit message that it's undocumented.
That's very sad and the issue was opened a year ago...
Please use logs instead of System.out. You can add a log4j configuration to redirect to stdout if you want to see these printings.
Thanks Kathey.
Blooper after blooper - I hate SVN.
I'm working on a huge application and the extra steps you mentioned were really pain in the ass for me. So I developed a small proxy class that handles class method bindings. First I've added a small proxy class Then added a category accessor to NSApplication (I actually added this to my application delegate and implemented ) Now you are ready to bind class methods to the Application object, even in the interface builder, with the keyPath .
Weird.
Especially I don't know very much about the test framework differences.
Thanks a lot Jon for signing up this.
This is my own program written in C++. It works really great! I just need to go to the next step and reassemble the TCP packets, I haven't a clue where to go next, as there is next to nothing on this out there!
As you may know, tonight, at exactly 23:31:30 UTC, Epoch Time will reach 1234567890! Hurray! One way of watching epoch time is by using Perl: Can you do the same in another programming language?
Keep repeating this and the problem just gets worse.
I could put the finalizeForCommandLine after processExceptionAtExit. Then it doesn't change anything for LIB_MPI and that wouldn't work anyhow as you point out.
That sucks why isn't the escape mechanism working?
I was intending on use the Title attribute in the @Page directive to customise each pages title, but it simply doesn't appear to do anything. The site uses master pages - I don't know if that is a consideration. Master Page snippet: Page snippet (from ): What is more, if I run the page through the , it complains about... end tag for "head" which is not finished ..whereas the the tag is present in the source code. I've already got a workaround in place, but it's annoying the hell out of me, so I'm determined to find a resolution!
As mentioned on StackOverflow podcast 30 - JanRain RPX has beaten me. Sad face for me.
I will try to do more research on it.
Learn jQuery. Rejoice! <-- take your pick.
Don't you need to unlink all the socket files as well?
awesome - what started off as a gripe turned into a real educational experience - thanks everyone!
This switches on distinct locales only, not on a primary language value where the secondary value may be different. This should instead be switch (ctl & LANGUAGE_MASK_PRIMARY) and ...
once per every bad disk).
Since I was also looking for a way to use the empty word epsilon I came up with the following approach. I simply used an empty production rule such as: Hope it works - at least for now it seems so ... Addendum: It works pretty fine :)
It will be great if you could confirm it either way first.
Let's avoid having commented out code. Delete the DCHECK (which looks wrong to me anyway - you certainly could have a const index, but backends are under no obligation to take advantage of that information.
then what's wrong with using new Color(0xFFFFFF) ?
I hate to say it, but the selected answer is wrong. C# Express ships with 3.5 SP1, including .NET SP2, etc...
@Gabriele No worries! Glad to have helped :)
I think columnName is a property that indicates a column's name. I'm going more for "which column should we extract from the file". I thought about maybe columnToUse. I'm not sure because this configuration is going on a wiki page. I'll change it for clarity, we can think about it more when we do the mediawiki change.
Great, excellent. You're welcome!
mahadev - I would love to help test a patch :) I'm currently using 3.3.1 + ZOOKEEPER-744 + ZOOKEEPER-790 applied in that order.
Is this valid ? what I'm really worried about is can you specify type and also use def at the same time?
I think you miss the (complicated) case of a conflmict between a move in a branch vs a uncontrolling in another branch => In which case there is a deletion compared to origin on one side, and a rename on the other side.
Forgot to mention: Thanks to Alejandro and his team for pointing this one...
@joe Yes, if I were to declare the property and synthesize it as above, but I don't explicitly declare an ivar myself, the compiler will still actually create the ivar. So I could do `int len = [self.stringProperty length]` as you'd expect inside the clas
Done sorry for all the mess on a simple patch.
Not sure about this method. It seems to make sense to me the way Dan explained it but I'm not comfortable giving this change a +2 since I didn't write any of the original code and may not be aware of all of the issues.
Have you looked into creating a plugin with waffle? From the waffle guys if should be possible to create a module using the servlet filter code. That would be a pretty awesome module for Play! I'll look into it when I get some spare time. https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/waffle-users/Q9aRPJitP6g
Thanks!
Doubles aren't compared that way in real life...
unused parameter 'pinfo' [-Werror=unused-parameter]
I think that this should be removed, and phdr->len and phdr->caplen needs to be incremented by 1 + 16 instead (see other comments below).
Awesome you rock Drew!
Sweet kickstart for our new wiki!
I'm using this code to launch a .cmd file: It works fine, but I want to actually see the cmd.exe window running. How can I make it show? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Excellent, thanks!
Great question! There have already been a few questions that address A few:

Should this call Free(), or just remove Free() and put that code in here?
Oh, man, I am sorry but I must say it: your code is really awful... It is not organised at all, but maybe... shouldn't be instead? EDIT: try to comment the second and third queries, since they seem useless, and make the "cur" -> "cursor" change I suggested:
Excellent, injekt!!! Loved the way you answered.
@JonesV excellent! I think thats what I wanted: "//*vptr is address of first virtual function in VTABLE viz. display()"

Thanks Ivan.
So this is a kind of helper method? I'd suggest then making it "private": def _benchmark(self, flavor, ...):
The correct one is according to JamesF "wiki" instead of "index.php". He's fixing it up on the server.
Because it's racy. It should be guarded optimally with a lock that is not so global, but then you're talking about improvements that are in the nanosec granularity.

Thanks to Fabrizio for the patch.
We use Hessian in our software, and I wish the previous developers didn't do this as we now have to access the hessian endpoint from C++. It's a pain and I prefer things to be in simple HTTP xml or json.
It looks like this allows a user who cannot see all branches to probe which branches exist. By looking at the error message "it doesn't exist" vs. "user does not have rights to delete it." a user can detect if a branch that is not visible to him exists.
Thank you for all the great answers! Sam & Talljoe's answers accomplished this most simply using Linq. Thx again!
Ah - make me look lazy! (guilty)
Matt - can you revue the accepted answer. You have to scroll a long way to get to a [pure javascript answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5686237/360211) and I fear some users just take the accepted answer as gospel and use antiquated libraries as a result.
The doxygen documentation will also be a bit better if you add \related ArrayRef to these functions (and similarly for the ConstArrayRef ones).
Patch Set 1: Thanks for your reviews. To be honest, it would be nice, if you could be a bit more friendly to - not first time in case of Thomas, but occasional - contributors. IMHO one or two -1 are enough for the beginning. Bjrn and Philipp, you're really helpful contributors, thanks for that. We were discussing the "patch for a patch rule" over the last days, which we enjoined on ourselves as core team members some time ago (and it works in at least most of the cases I think). Please don't treat this as harsh words, I just want to make you aware of the fact that motivating every new contributor is very important for us, and hopefully also for you as an essential part of the TYPO3 community. Thanks for your support! Steffen P.S: The reason, why Jenkins fails is probably, because of the parent commit is very old and the patch has to be rebased. Will try to get this done now (if network connection allows)
I use ApexSQL Diff. It is an excellent tool for doing just what you're describing...compare schema, compare data, generate change scripts. It not free, but it works well. NOTE: ApexSQL Diff only works with SQL Server.
My bad I screwed up the assertion -> RuntimeException transition.
I have found the from Position Absolute to just be that, Absolutely awesome! :). I have an on how to include it in ASP.NET MVC and in ASP.NET, you could just pass it the generated form id.
That looks like an excellent technique and pretty much negates my question! :)
could you explain why we need wrap this code in GuiActionRunner?
With auto-generated CRUD methods you don't need to define these methods manually. Please check this patch https://review.openstack.org/#/c/62865/
@Stilly.stack wooow I didn't know that that was important!! thanks a lot :)
Loved the keyboard geeks part!
Please note the comment on SC_GLOBSTR_STR_COUNT, which is the overall count of strings. So actually you need to insert and define STR_TABLE_COUNT to 533 and increment the value of SC_GLOBSTR_STR_COUNT to 534.
For the final commit remove "[part 2of 2]" and join the "ODFF function FDIST" to the first summary line.
Great work...this is awesome stuff.
I would suggest changing the name of this, we actually use Neutron Drivers for spec reviews (confusing I know, given line 61 below). Since each of these has it's own review team, perhaps we can somehow indicate that here?
Right ... if only I was using SQL server.. Informix unfortunately :( :( :(
yeah, just wondered how likely that would be in combination with OStringBuffer?
HADOOP-2949: - If tarball is specified HOD no longer validates for the pkgs directory in gridservice-hdfs or mapred sections as these are not going to be used anyway.

I've looked at what can be done within the NSIS framework we use to build the Windows installer.
excellent, thanks much!
is it not by default ? if yes , then it is really horrible...
Scary question!
thank you so much as long you replace char(0) with 0 in the above this works great!
that was from something else - that apparently the fragmentmanager holds on to fragments. But you're right - it doesn't make any difference one way or the other. Nice library by the way - extremely useful!
valign is still spread a lot across the core - this will be a seperate task to clean this up. this makes it only more easy to find.

Furthermore if you need to look at the .NET/unmanaged stack just donwload and look at your w3wp.exe processes to examine memory and other stats without having to do a remote/local debugging (just look at the .NET Tab on the properties of the process). It will show all the .NET performance counters for that particular process. Awesome tool!
No worries just making sure that you had solved it!
I've tried several other IDEs (the last one was eclipse) but always come crying back. The thing I end up missing most is homesite's 'tag insight' for all the html tags.
In this case, we only need to set it (item->old_offset) to zero, because _wal_flush_cmp() function compares 'item->offset' instead when 'it->old_offset' is zero. Thanks.
strange error. One of which i cannot find any existing resources to solve the issue. The issue is, when using I get pointed to a folder at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DevServer\10.0". Naturally, this breaks everything which depends on the correct folder (the one my solution is actually in) being given. What is more strange is that there exists a unit-test to make sure that this path at least has the correct root folder and sometimes it will pass and will be working as expected, and then the very next debug, will point to the aforementioned folder again. Very confusing and very annoying ! Any ideas ?
Sorry guys... :( I was the reason for this trouble.

I can't help, but good luck! What a great game that was. Will this be a commercial release?
because it is terribly difficult to get right. But I mention `boost::iterator_facade`.
where do these section come from - the linker feeling clever?
I finally worked it out - the sql directory needed to have a folder named 'rapt_setup' with the sql inside that!? Doh! But as J.S provided so much help I still want him to receive the answer points :)
You'll get bool to int conversion warnings with these return calls.Fix by return this-> ...()? 1 : 0;

Malice? Seriously though, it's hard to account for formatting style sometimes. It's largely a matter of personal taste. Personally, I think that both forms are a little nasty unless you're seriously restricted in terms of line-length.
By creating datastore models that inherit from the Expando class I can make my model-entities/instances have dynamic properties. That is great! But what I want is the names of these dynamic properties to be determined at runtime. Is that possible? For example, Is this possible? If yes, how to do this? I have already tried some funny ways to do this but did not succeed :P Thanks in advance.
This is a mis-rendering in Gerrit. The actual code is properly indented.
Is there a shorthand for a new line character in Scala? In Java (on Windows) I usually just use "\n", but that doesn't seem to work in Scala - specifically outputs in Eclipse, (sic) from the command line, and from the REPL (GREAT SUCCESS!) works, but is there anything shorter?
For an excellent event manager class, check Danny Miller's: http://k2xl.com/wordpress/2008/07/02/as3-eventmanager-class-removealllisteners/
IMHO, we should explicitely add coverage for the method you're adding so we could isolate any problem later on
This is better than mine. Didn't know you could do a string array for formats. Very nice!
I don't know how the hell my diff program decided to add seemingly random CR chars but I've removed them now.
For SQL Server 2005, I ALWAYS had to install the full product first, then Express second. If I did it the other way around, the full SQL install would see Express installed already, and would not continue with the install. It was extremely annoying. Not sure if they fixed this with 2008.
Very useful, Thanks You!
actually I don't know why it is like this in the login but not in the logout.. I would assume it should be the same in both places, and that this one is the more robust one..
If you're debugging at the instruction level rather than the source level, it's an awful lot for you easier to map unoptimized instructions back to the source. Also, compilers are occasionally buggy in their optimizers. In the Windows division at Microsoft, all release binaries are built with debugging symbols and full optimizations. The symbols are stored in separate PDB files and do not affect the performance of the code. They don't ship with the product, but most of them are available at the .
Shouldn't be here (or anywhere, see my comment below re select).
I assumed you didn't care about modifying the caller's array because "resources += srcs" modifies resources in-place as well. Yay Python. So you should fix that below. Also typically in Python we strongly discourage mutable default arugments.
Concatenate the calls to append: StringBuilder msg = new StringBuilder() .append("\n") .append("Can not find the %s at this location: %s\n") .append("Please provide alternative URL");
Wow, it works! Thanks.
Ok, here's one way of doing this, but it's terrible! I'm still looking for an easier way:
I HATE SKYPE!!!
It's one less file to update for anyone adding an extcap executable. I was hoping to migrate the Windows buildbots to CMake this week, which would make this less critical.
Wow that was some bad copy/paste work.
Thanks to your excellent instruction, I understood enough to figure out what was going on and also what was needed! Here's what I came up with. It's clunky but it does the job! Thanks again everyone.
Is there a reason we are not doing stuff like the below, which seems to me would better across a wider range of machines: // lockFocusFlipped not available before OSX 10.6 if ([pimage respondsToSelector:@selector(lockFocusFlipped:)]) { [pImage lockFocusFlipped:YES]; } else { [pImage setFlipped: YES]; [pImage lockFocus]; }
though I disagree with a signficant amount of statements you madeI don't think we would ever come to agreement anyway.
+1 for the /f I've written couple of scripts for that but without /f it was such a pain; required me to be there when running the script to type "y+[return]"
I think it's time to just close this issue.
This is a stupidity of windows find utility, +1 for feeling my pain.
Passing a whole volfile path this way seems a bit fragile. Would it be possible to pass the flag and a *relative* path, so that the receiver constructs the final path instead of the sender?
This is definitely great for small stuff!
Hey, you guys are great, thanks a whole bunch! I will set up the environment in the cron script.
Here are 2 patches ... one for adjustExamplePaths.bat & .sh and the other a new file holding 2 User Libraries ... UIMA_LIB & UIMA_AS_LIB Not sure where this should go ...
Have you tried the and methods? There is a that mentions the approach. Also, in JDBC 4.0 Sun added the that allows you to get a unique handle on a row. The feature is supported by Oracle and DB2. For sql server you will probably need a third party driver such as . Good luck!
Version 2.2.0RC3 is fine.
This is more obvious in this file than the other. You should be escaping the periods in your regular expressions. I know that it will match the period in the URL anyway, but we want it to *only* match the period. Also, you should use specific matches for scid, height and width, rather than the period (match anything). Assuming that you're just matching numbers, '[0-9]+', or tentatively '\d+' would be better here. One more thing, if these sites provide copy-and-paste embed tags, these matches will need to be able to deal with those too - currently they look like they will just modify the URL in-place, and this is definitely not what we want.
I have a password that I want to store as property in a Web Part that can be set via the tool pain. Currently it is a String and can be clearly read. How would I go about making it * out? If this is the wrong way to be doing this what would you advice to do instead?
I'm trying to compile code that I know to be working on other peoples' machines but is throwing a particular error on my system. Specifically the error relates to the printf() method The method printf(String, Object[]) in the type PrintStream is not applicable for the arguments (String, double) For instance Does anyone know why this error is cropping up? There are alternatives to using printf(), but this is very annoying!
Forget the patch for the moment.
all 3 log methods now do make use of the instance variables: accountCache, groupCache, groupBackend
Someone is scared to tell the reason of -1 !
Pretty self explanatory question. I just don't know how to do it. I've been using Eclipse for about a month so I still have a lot to learn. I'm using the newest version of eclipse Juno and need to push the app (or email it) to my MyTouch. How would I do it from eclipse, as that is the way I would prefer? If I should just email it, would I email the whole project folder or just a particular piece of code? I thank you for all your help in advance. This site has been so incredibly helpful!
That's great! Thanks a lot for the tip!
Yes definately turn off that Solution Wide processing. It's a hog.
No, and I would be very afraid if there was.
+1 for "don't believe into the myths that there are a lot of issues with MS Access"
what I am trying to do it show what terminal port im useing when I am currently logged in to my linux server. If anyone could offer some help I would be very greatfull!! thanks
I'm still trying to understand what this new logic brings to the table...after all of this effort, we are still just enforcing that the project/tenant-id that created an entity (secret/order) is the same one that can perform operations on that entity. However, the database relationships used in the entity queries enforce this, so what does all of this do that is different? If we were doing attribute-level access control, it might make more sense to me, but entity level for tenant-id RBAC is redundant to the db queries to me.
Is this valid ? what I'm really worried about is can you specify type and also use def at the same time?
Few things to make this work :Your classname FILE should start with a capital letter, Your config array must be defined as $config = array() (and not $var or any other name), Your config file must be lowercase.The config file is passed through the constructor, so class ($config=array()), you can then access and store the config variables on an instance variable. hope it helps: config file : good luck :)
Looks like this is fixed :)
Amazing how well this works! I had excellent answers immediately! It's like I'm living in the future!
guys... this is so stupid...
Awesome! Thanks.
Take a 200th upvote for an excellent question.
I want the next item to be dequeued when the previously dequeued item has been consumed by the caller (as there is no facility to enqueue an item again). So I am using the unbuffered channel for this synchronization.
That is great news!
I have a long scrolling page, and want to test if an element is 100px from the top, then apply a class elsewhere (until the next element in line is 100px from the top) If I could just get the basic statement I would be ecstatic, anything extra would be a bonus!
<3 <3 <3 ! ! ! :)
This was very bad documented.
@Rob same problem, nothing. very disgusting
Is this visual studio specific or all c++ projects behave this way? Why??
As title, basically I have a user control placed inside a page and then the page is placed inside the master page. I want to extract a block of javascript and put it back to the page head. When I try to wrap the code inside any block control (e.g. a div runat server) and access divID.InnerText then ASP.NET bust off with I dont want to extract JS inside cs file, thats awfully ugly approach (all sort of escapes and people wont even notice you have JS written unless they drill your CS file), what can I do?
Currently the msbuild logs for team build are appalling as they are just plain text and are very difficult to read. Also the ones created by my build are approx 30Mb and take quite a while to download (our TFS server is in our datacentre). Does anyone know any way of being able to view these logs easier, prefereably integrated with either TFS itself or TFS WebAccess?
Thanks Adrian!
Can do, will have to swap the mechanisms of how it works (from false to true), and set the default to true (ie device detection enabled)
Great info! Thanks, Alex! :)
Excellent, injekt!!! Loved the way you answered.
I stumbled upon this site and really loved the way they have done the navigation on the left hand site. I noticed that site is using jquery but didnt see any plugins. Any ideas on how to go about doing this?
How absolutely terrible you can't set controls not to show up on the print
Great question! I also find myself a little lost in WPF because of the amount of flexibility it offers and have been looking for guidance in how to choose fonts, layout, spacing, colors, etc. I've had a hard time finding books or websites to improve my UI design skills, so I hope we find great answers here!
If someone wants to take this over that's cool - I'm unlikely to have time in the next week and a half though.
we can actually allocate a 4K buffer which would be bigger enough to store the message.
G'day, One of the best recommendations I can make is to read the relevant section(s) of Steve McConnell's Code Complete (). He has an excellent discussion on naming techniques. HTH cheers, Rob
Not currently. It's somewhat different from what the current reference data approach uses, as I guess that you would want to generate that state using some code that is not part of the test (since if you can generate the state with code that runs anywhere, you do not really benefit from serialization). Generic serialization is also a significant amount of code, even if straightforward (and with C++, it requires some careful thinking on what kind of constraints it enforces on the serializable types, unless you make the object itself responsible for the serialization).
Gotta love stackoverflow!
Excellent, Thanks!
expected about 600 users. I am worried that running 1200+ queries (should be much more than that) will eventually result in a timeout... now i am worrying whether I am creating a discussion rather than a QnA
Ugh sorry :( Thanks!
Because SQL migrations requires it for work on the ec2 credential table.
if this was copied from another IT (?) and the GAV was not changed, it will conflict with the other IT when 'mvn install' installs it into the local repo. It's a good idea to make all GAVs used in test projects specific to the IT that is being run to avoid unwanted crosstalk/side-effects between unrelated ITs, esp. when they are being run in parallel. (and I know some ITs we have are not good examples for this...) I.e. same comment applies to all pom.xmls used here for test projects.
The problem is that "Hello World" is a terrible example to use with TDD. You really need something that generates variable output based on variable input.
I think you also need to add -.7em to this 24px. That number comes from the .fulltext-search left and right margins. Otherwise there is a horizontal scroll on the page.
They're not, and can't be. Same as with proto fields that this code is a copy of... and quite a few other pre-existing Lua code spots too for that matter.
I really enjoy using Beanstalk too. I few days ago I realized an iPhone app to get access to your account info on your iPhone, this is the iTunes link: Best! Pablo
None of the above is exactly what I was looking for, so I wrote one. super simple to use %B in the printf!
What the hell I'll give this a shot.
are you sure about this loop, which does not run ;-)
changed to prefix operator++ (and further down in the code, too) I had it mostly coded with date serial numbers, but had to make functions that are available for class Date. I could only find appropiate date serial number functions in the sc/addin/analysis module, a module that I would rather move entirely to the 'normal' calc function module once the Excel-analysis-addin can be considered obsolete. IMHO that would reduce the complexity of the calc-function code. I will peg Date to date serial number conversion as a toDo item on my lo-task stack.
For a good c compiler use . It is an excellent compiler which a huge device database to select from! You can use keil to generate a Hex file (in the Intel hex file format). You can then load the hex file into to simulate your design and see the output!
please add a comment explaining why leaving a try statement in the AST (with no catch blocks and no finally block) would leave the AST in an unsafe state
Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved I concur with jrbarnette@. It sounds like we can do a separate issue/CL for removing the pragma. To that end, I think a TODO() referring to that issue could be useful if added to this CL.
@ShlomiHassid no worries!
I used multiple requests - batches of 10. I don't want to anger the Api!
So those need to be enabled on as as-needed basis. Kconfig knows about SSE and its ilk. Noted, will take care of it.
The main points are hat we avoid to repeat the code block below twice (or three when merging the JRE task), and reading each task is easier to know exactly what the diferences ares
Sorry, I was just trying to help and obviously misread the question. No need to get angry!
this is gorgeous!
Currently making a java program that grabs data off of a MSAccess Database and some of these errors are extremely frustrating. I keep getting this SQL.Exception : Too few parameters. Expected 1 error on the last remaining bugs in this program. Little background on the db: It has 3 tables (A player table (11 columns), a team table (3 columns), and an Opponent table (6 columns). These are both of the functions and I am fairly certain the problem lies in here somewhere or this function
I guess this must be an unsigned integer because of the way we shift bits in the next file. However, in that case the width too is likely important, and I would suggest using gmx_uint32_t for clarity.
indent is not right: Use space and not TAB
Well either you query the database every damn time and your plugin/tool/code will be super slow.
My bad, I did add one but then removed it again and forgot to change that line back
Found the culprit! At first I tried the solution suggested by @billinkc in the comment, it worked (I managed to create a folder) but the folder wasn't usable as I couldn't upload packages. I have db_owner permission on the MSDB database and so I can see and access the SSIS MSDB folder. What I really needed was the db_ssisadmin permission. Not to worry as db_owner permissions allow me to give myself the db_ssisadmin permission! After this was done, all the problems (the one in the original Q and more) disappeared.
@mludd: excellent!
unused parameter 'pinfo' [-Werror=unused-parameter]
The Java profiler is an excellent commercial solution. You can find further information in the docs on and .
I wouldn't recommend to use a percentage here.. With "This change is backwards-compatible most of the time" or "This does not change the public API..." we should be on the safe side
If I plan to use data caching do I have to worry about conflicts when also using deferred loading? It seems that with linq i am losing control of my data.
Adding to Megumi's nit: Consider initializing the value to true, and possibly collapsing these two methods down to one with an argument
No worries, I know how annoying this stuff can be!
I'm just getting my feet wet with multiprocessing(and its totally awesome!), but I was wondering if there was any guidelines to selecting number of processes? Is it just based on number of cores on the server? Is it somehow based on the application your running(number of loops, how much cpu it uses,etc)? etc...how do I decide how many processes to spawn? Right now, I'm just guessing and add/removing processes but it would be great if there was some kind of guideline or best practice. Another question, I know what happens if I add too few(program is slooow) but what if I add 'too many'? Thanks!
Also your username was stupidly named and confusing so I deleted it and created a new one more appropriate.
that is simply awesome :-)
[info] Line matches the illegal pattern 'more than one blank line'.
@ajreal no worries, I think I managed to fix it!
Sorry I guess I'm against "never computing this shit"... because you guys think returning NaN is ok.
Should be renamed together with the class it tests.
Horrible discovering !!!!
Please use import for java.util.Arrays, instead using explicitly here.
You need to do error detection etc.. Perhaps its easier to just build up a single buffer, and then call a single function to write everything to disk so that you have a single place to add file IO error detection (and logging).
Reuse the ChangeControl instance instead of loading the change again.
Patch Set 6: Except for my spaces nitpicking, yes ;-)
Sorry Gav DONE Committed revision 2487.
There are a few plugins which you could look at for that functionality, if not flat-out use: Good luck, hope these help!
I'm trying to delete several working copy directories, but I get an Access Denied on all the SVN files, running as admin or normal user. I've killed the Tortoise cache process, and cannot figure what is wrong. Any suggestions?
Excellent recipe!
commit.hashCode() should be sufficient. A commit can only have one author.
Suppose I have this interface And this class Is there a way, or is there a tool that can let me automatically put in the comments of each member in a base class or interface? Because I hate re-writing the same comments for each derived sub-class!
The doc comments are inheritted from the parent class(es)
wow this is really awesome! thanks for that @petert
Absolutely terrible!!! It is not Dependecy Injection
This is probably what you were looking for: It's an uber awesome, extremely useful app to track your overall app downloads & sales!
Enlightenment DR16 is packaged with openSUSE 11.1 but it's a bit painful to use with KDE apps as there's no obvious (on the Enlightenment site, google etc.) way to provide a systray for KDE apps that require one (e.g., ktorrent). Anyone know of a way around this? I'm not using e for the eye-candy - I'm running on a 2.6GHz Celeron and KDE (4.1) performance isn't exactly stellar so I'm trying out a few alternatives.
1. This seems like a hack to work around a bug -- why are we reading from the pty after it is closed? 2. This hack also looks too broad -- if any error occurs we close the pipe and stop reading, while squelching the error. This seems bad. Same comments below.
who the hell starts using our jira for typing lessons ?!?
Sorry guys I've been pretty busy work but I have been watching this.
This will always be nil, right? As above, I think you can remove this argument.
excellent, thanks!

Excellent, thank you for sharing this!
Seems we didn't enforce an exec for sh but we did for fs.
Not sure why this one is confusing. It returns the list of files, so it has to be immediate, and it returns the files in that directory, not ones in sub directories.
@Marc-AndrÃ© Lafortune Your answer there was incredibly helpful! Thank you!
Can anyone help me add children to a plist? I think I want to record an index of rows from the plist and then state which index row to write the key too. I'm not sure how to say if the key will be a string, dictionary or array. The following is code from another question on adding a key to root. Any help would be extremely appreciated :)
i think we're better off just taking the auto-generated stub like we did in the original patch. it doesn't hurt anyone that there's dead code at the end because the syscall never returns, and it's arguably more confusing to be insisting on supplying our own stub.
@Styxxy, It looks like the GPMC is explicitly designed for AD GPO's and/or doesn't support modifying GPO values, and the process for tracking registry values doesn't seem to apply to many of the Local GP's that can be modified in the gpedit.msc interface
Sorry guys
very sad, for erlang programmers :(
It works pretty well and provides status information for impatient users. Note that nrms is a shared variable among the threads and that the line is overprint with the carriage return character in a fifo manner.
It's very painful to add multiple tickets to Trac or to have it as your own todo list. That causes people to use their own task management tools so tasks are then spread all around. Is there any plugin or macro that would quicken the process of adding a ticket?
I think that's just a mistake in make.bash. It's better to fail fast and minimize distractions to stderr when you know you've already lost. I'd say add an exit failure here and then submit. If you feel strongly about keeping it as-is, you can submit this too and we can fix them both later if we decide to.
Sad that you had to preface with "Reasons for doing this aside" in order to prevent a flame war or such...
yes I'm having the exact same issue, very annoying!
Haha great :) Happens to the best of us!
@Chris, excellent, I'm thrilled to hear that you're migrating to salted hashes! :)
I have a really bad habit of not reading thru all the bug comments before asking questions.
My application links against libsamplerate.a. I am doing this to make distributing the final binary easier. I am worried that perhaps the code inside the .a file depends on some other libraries I also will need to distribute. But if it doesn't I am worried I am bloating up my application too much by including multiple copies of eg. libc. What exactly will be inside libsamplerate.a? Just libsamperate's bytecode? Or more?
not for my company, so I don't have to worry ;-)
Sorry ;-) +1
The problem is that "Hello World" is a terrible example to use with TDD. You really need something that generates variable output based on variable input.
I just launched with a stack of new features, including the MP Spotlight you can see on the Homepage Every few seconds, the following code is run, which goes and fetches the next MP and fades the old one out and the new one in. Looks great! BUT If you scroll down to the bottom of the page, and wait till the MP spotlight refreshes, the browser scrolls back to #memberList Does anyone know what's causing this? How can I stop it from scrolling? Any help is greatly appreciated.
I've used Clojure, it's great for an ex-Lisper! I may do it opposite from you and learn Haskell next.
Great! Absolutely wonderful! Thank you very much!
Enumerating all partitions of a set is . Now, all permutations of all partitions of a set will be , although the example is a bit artificial. Now, to come up with a useful algorithm it's a totally different story. I am not aware of any such algorithm, and in any case its scaling will be absolutely awful.
Awesome sketch!
Awesome - great stuff Maria. Thanks!
Excellent explanation! +1 for you Sir
I didn't know we needed to retain backwards config capability across 3.x to 4.x :-( That sucks and it'll make old code stick around longer.
Thats sweet that you have the prior experience hacking this on top of a store already.
Horrible discovering !!!!

Link is now dead :(
Short and to the point... excellent! +1
@Mario I disagree, while the answer is outrageously awful, it's still an answer.
I remember 'Url' was the suggested one but URL class itself was all upper case so I was in between. I'm changing it to fromUrl.
+1 for the excellent approximation!
Why are you using cerr here instead of vtkErrorMacro?
The list of maintainers seems to be organized alphabetically by translator name. I guess tiering should be listed after quota.
what about this case? if user selected sysprep/cloud init in run once (then we get here) but also have payload configured?
quotad count already there. please remove this from your code.
I tested this code out with an Access 2007 database with no exceptions (I went as high as 13000 inserts). However, what I noticed is that it is terribly slow as you are creating a connection every time. If you put the "using(connection)" outside the loop, it goes much faster.
Hi I have designed a query that returns a set of data such as: What I want to do in SQL Reporting Services is to display data in a grid fashion. Such as For the dataset I provide. I want it to auto page break when needed, etc. Is there anything built in that I can use? Any recommendations on how to do this is greatly appreicated! Thanks.
there's no point shuffling the deckchairs though. assume that anything that's not C++ yet is a bug and should just be moved straight to C++.
We added this snippet to LocalSettings.php, with great success: Thanks!
Excellent! Thanks :)
I think you miss the (complicated) case of a conflmict between a move in a branch vs a uncontrolling in another branch => In which case there is a deletion compared to origin on one side, and a rename on the other side.
my pleasure :) :)
I wrote something that does work, but it's extremely ugly, but thought it could either help someone else or we could get something better. Here's what I came up with:
After reading I was horrified! Isn't there a tool out there that can inspect a .h/.cpp file and deduce what dependencies could be waivered?
I ended up using , which met all my needs and is (IMO) very excellent.
This is incredibly useful, thank you!
This is simply the tip of the WTF iceberg I'm exposing with this question. The rest of the app, and the purpose for its very existence is more painful, if you'll believe it.
OK, so what do you want me to do about that? Hint: how about *telling us* what your problem is?
They could probably be combined, but the speed would be the same. We still need to write the address out first before we can auto-increment. Let's leave that to later when/if it gets moved to the southbridge wrapper
I got very angry with Oracle today after reading lots of editable TableView solutions involving setOnEditCommit, which is just NOT the right way it should be done. Following is a much better and simpler solution I found after digging the JavaFX source:
So I'm fine with your logic but given that I don't understand it please don't get upset when I ask questions on how I have to use it.
Not sure what our own script has to do with the annotation. The export pragma could all be moved into the imp file if you prefer that. This would leave us with only the keep for where we misusing the preprocessor as template language (pme.c). I think we should replace this anynow. Right now if one runs it on any of the c++ files, IWYU makes changes we don't want. See the issues in the commit message. But I don't see how that could be fixed by using a script to read the output. It seems it would be easier to patch IWYU than replicating the header-analysis in a post-processing script.
who uses this method ? I don't see why this is useful. I'd just get rid of this method and the associated field. Once you do that, you can just collapse this class into a single static method (runAll) and get rid of the Pair class.
(lack of line breaks in comments is saddening!)
`cat $(find $FOLDER -name "*.txt")` that's terrible!

Check out the WordPress repository. There is a plugin called WP GCM Its a very great one and has some great extras!
Not sure about this method. It seems to make sense to me the way Dan explained it but I'm not comfortable giving this change a +2 since I didn't write any of the original code and may not be aware of all of the issues.
there should be } else { rv = get_env_plugin_info(pi); In this case the lcb_cntl user will get correct effective type
In which case, shouldn't the code just say that all other open projects should already have their SDK's pointing to the SDK used by the IDE? i.e., now that we do this, we shouldn't have to modify other projects, only this project since all others should already be in sync. The fishy part here is just that choosing something in a project import dialog affects other projects which doesn't make sense. If you want that experience, then the dialog should be more of a global IDE preference.
No worries! IE11 does a poor job of emulating other browser versions.
@R.. Wow! Really great answer!! You should post it as an answer here, as it's really more precise. Just a question, though, when you say round for the alignment of the type, you mean that if for example on your example you had a short b instead of int b,
Excellent tutorial!

I'm not for sure how the ControlCollection of ASP.Net works, so maybe someone can shed some light on this for me. I recently discovered the magic that is extension methods and Linq. Well, I was very sad to find that this isn't valid syntax However from what I can tell, does implement the interface which provides such methods, so what gives? Why doesn't that just work? I have found a decent work around for this issue at least:
I don't have very much experience on branch0 would you like to take a shot at the port?
There is no point in defining those private static variables, we could just use the string literal directly in the methods. It was like that originally because the original definitions were public static final's. We then switched to methods so that they could be overriden.
I'd be interested to hear how this works out. You are very brave :)
Nitpick: The pointer is only set in the ctor, so it should be const. Similarly in KEY2StyleContext.
Is there a sensible way to group Long UTC dates by Day? I would Mod them by 86400 but that doesn't take leap seconds into account. Does anyone have any other ideas, I'm using java so I could parse them into Date Objects, but I'm a little worried of the performance overhead of using the date class. Also is there a more efficient way than comparing the year month and day parts of a Date object?
Excellent advice, thanks!
XCode 5.0 Console Not Showing After Exiting App and Reopening. I put a simple NSLog in the next screen that I push to and there is no logging of it in my console. This makes it a pain to debug! I segue from one screen to a tabbar controller, if that helps? Has anyone encountered this issue?

You made an excellent point in a comment below, @RailsSon: you want to print Â£s to display a specific currency, but employ that display using a Japanese expression for financial numbers. I find it strange that your request hasn't been implemented in the language by decoupling the `locale` module's use of currency value and that currency's display properties.

All macros in southbridge.h are Vortex86EX PCI S/B config register offsets. They are all fixed for Vortex86EX CPU.
These methods should also probably go in the anonymous namespace.
The problem is that you never run the method, so the field stays at zero. It's a really terrible idea to give a field and a method the same name.
Ended up being a bad dependency. I had to add it manually to get it all working. Terrible!

I'm currently tuning a large app that uses L2S using the following process (to great success!) Start SQL Server Profiler and create a trace using the 'Tuning' template that gets saved to a file. Then interact with your app to exercise the slow spots. Stop the trace then start up the Database Engine Tuning Advisor. You can load up the trace file you just created and have it suggest all sort of optimizations. I've just created 5 non-clustered indexes based on its suggestions and my app is easily 90% faster that it was before.
Thank you, the first example was extremely helpful and I now have it working, thanks!
We could, but that'd mean installing wsdl2ruby and so on and so forth. Sometimes Dog Slow is fine :-)
can you combine the declaration of ctstr above with this assignment ?
The correct one is according to JamesF "wiki" instead of "index.php". He's fixing it up on the server.

I have an Android app that looks absolutely horrible if the user sets their font size to large or extra large (via Settings -> Display -> Font size in Ice Cream Sandwich). It just plain wasn't designed for variable font sizes, and it makes a lot of the text unreadable. I've seen applications that preserve the font size for most views, so I know that there has to be a way to do this. Is there a simple way for me to tell the application to ignore the user's font size preference? And if there isn't, how would you suggest that I go about calculating the font sizes? If nothing else, is there a way for me to retrieve the user's font size preference?
I think I have addressed this in the updated version too.
Loved this solution!
Great! I Will take a look later. Cheers.
I can't find anything on google. This question is the last hope!
Resolving again....
don't confuse algorithm with implementation. env is not supposed to be used this way as it's touched from different places. it was said many times that using env to pass data between different codepaths is a bad idea.
Hell this is gonna take me a lot of work to raise.
Bejesuz that's ugly! Whomever wrote that should be flogged.
Was afraid someone would say that...! Is there any hack I could put in place?
Sure, I can switch over to a white-list. I just killed the ones I really didn't like (e.g. MD5 :).

Um sorry i thought this ticket was about something else - patch attached David would you give a try?
I screwed up the encoding of the stopwords file (sorry).
whose bugfix? what is the bug number? the comment is as helpful as it could be :) if there is a fix for this but not enough time to test best to let future programmer know where to look
There's already bunch of strcpy calls scattered throughout this file anyways.

I really love the "one model in - one model out" idea of Fubu MVC. A controller would look something like this and the service locator would automagically fill in all the required dependencies in the constructor. This makes the controller very easy to test. So my question is: How would you go about tweaking asp.net mvc to allow this simplicity in the controllers ?
I have really enjoyed playing with my first robot. Now I want to make something a little more exciting. What's the best tutorial on making advanced robots?
I understand you need to know the sizes conversion. Sometimes I use this tool: And I found an excellent article about the screen sizes and densities: I hope it will be useful for you!
Is this marked 'latest' in the other place it's defined?
I know that there is a Item.RoleAssignments.Remove command but I have not found a way to list out all the current assigned groups so I could loop through and remove them. Hope this helps you guys!

I want to bulkload my cassandra data from node A to node B. when I set the 'listen_address' of each cassandra.yaml file to localhost, they do not show error on console but the data is never transmitted. when I set each node's listen address to their own local network[eth1 ipv4]address (192.168....), I get the following error. I can read from this error log that the application is trying to access to port 1..4 and I do not have no idea what on earth is going on. each node is on the virtual machine on the Virtual Box Hypervisor. Both OS is centOS. Here is my cassandra.yaml (the cassandra.yaml of target file is also configured the same way) thrift_max_message_length_in_mb: 16 Can anybody give me advice? I am really suffering as hell.
Thanks Alexei the patch is fine.
use macro VKEY_FEATURES_INODE_QUOTA and VKEY_FEATURES_QUOTA
oh, good catch! funny this slipped in ... btw: ArrayUtility from extbase should be reviewed and at first glance it seems most of it could be merged to core ArrayUtility.
You may be looking for a solution similar to Josh Smith's "". In his article, he presents the following: And then uses the multi-value converters as follows: Hope this helps!
Sorry guys
we might want to support Z here, since that's coming in a day or two
The size here is now just the size of the struct, hence the names (old/new) will not be a part of the dict. Further, dict_set_bin, takes in a pointer, that it strores in the xattr/dict and later is freed when this dict is destroyed. In the case of passing a pointer which is a structure containing another pointer, the dict routines cannot encode this into the dict. Overall, as info is passed to be stored as a dict, the above mechanism of allocating a pointer within info and passing this would fail to send these values across and also leak memory for the allocated info->buffer.
Since the array is actually only used in one case, I'm not sure that makes sense. Added a comment instead.
That's too sad :(
Managing url paths can be a real pain in ASP.NET. AbsolutePath vs RelativePath vs etc. drives me crazy. I find that many solutions require the user to edit web.config element to include the correct subfolder path; ex. Website Root: Web.config setting: / Website Root: web.config setting: /blog/ Is there a way to properly handle this without having to make changes to the web.config?
Ohh, well this is sad! I found the error and it unfortunately just was a typographical error...
Add ": " after "successful" otherwise the detail message will be appended directly onto it without any space.
Ryan Oberoi makes an excellent suggestion, but it's a bit overkill for my small ASP.NET MVC web application. I like Lobstrosity's idea since it could apply to any class tag and its short and simple... just what I need. Both are good answers yet one solves the general question (involving a css framework) and the other one solves my specific need... I guess I should select Ryan's response as the solution as it would probably help others more... any suggestions?
+1 for the sarcasm!
isn't generic, so your code is effectively: At that point is it clearer why you need the cast? (Not that the cast will really anything at execution time, of course...) You're not calling which is what you really want to be doing, effectively. It's just another case of Java generics being a bit of a pain :(
I think the cleanest style here would be to make this: class_linker->IsCompiledImageMethod(m) and then embed MayBe... into ClassLinker as IsCompiledImageMethod. It'd be nice to avoid exposing the debugger to inner notions of oat files.
Non-standard ports (And other more exotic configs) now have their own section that I've added in this commit
that's a really cool functionality of php i didn't know about! I'm not exactly sure how I'd actually _use_ it, but that's still cool!
That is awful advice! I don't mean to be overtly mean but I lolled.
I would guess it is doing basic sanity checking (i.e. should anything have changed) - to prevent unexpected source code changes (I hate it when opening a file can cause side-effects - I'm looking at you, DBML!). On a side note, to force serialization generally (I don't think it will apply due to the above): the and are a convention used by the framework.
GetDate() does not return a date serial number, it returns a "formatted" number with YYYYMMDD, see include/tools/date.hxx how nDate is stored in init(), which is returned by GetDate().
I m really excited to know that html 5 has in build support for audio and video playback( I know its old news but I just woke up ! :P) . What is even more exciting is that it can play local audio/video files in matters of some click. I had a look at this , could not find any offline video player. my question is why is that people are not developing an offline media player which could just be loaded form a website ? are there some issues ? Thanks
Don't hate me just throwing this out there.
My bad.
Other's have posted equally viable options, so really pick the one that makes the code prettiest to you! :-)
Great Solution!
Not without logging or tracing, I'm afraid
Yeah... I'm not a huge fan. Their documentation, tutorials, and guides are pretty nice. Here's the guide: https://parse.com/docs/ios_guide#top/iOS Here's the documentation: https://parse.com/docs/ios/api/ Here's the video tutorial for PFQueryTableView: https://parse.com/tutorials/parse-query-table (A little dated but very nice) Hope this helps! :)
What the hell I'll give this a shot.
There's an excellent series of posts on execution plans and how to read and interpret them - and a totally free e-book on the topic as well! - on the excellent Simple-Talk site. Check them out - well worth the time!
Daryn the current patch looks good.
Do you need to check $result['edit']['result'] === 'Success'?
How can I check if I have listed all the dependencies correctly? The is an excellent tool for checking both build dependencies and dependencies by setting up a clean base system within a chroot environment. By compiling the package within pbuilder, you can easily check the build dependencies, and by testing it within a pbuilder environment, you can check the dependencies.
sorry.
Excellent, thanks very much!
according to [1] signature relevant files are META-INF/MANIFEST.MF META-INF/*.SF META-INF/*.DSA META-INF/*.RSA META-INF/SIG-* so depending on the signing algorithm used you may have to also exclude META-INF/*.DSA META-INF/SIG-* [1] http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html#Signed_JAR_File
Line lengths, seems like most of these would be easier to read if they were placed on the preceding line before the variables.
thank you so much as long you replace char(0) with 0 in the above this works great!
Yes, and it does. I submitted an amendment with a better comment explaining that.
I understand you need to know the sizes conversion. Sometimes I use this tool: And I found an excellent article about the screen sizes and densities: I hope it will be useful for you!
Thanks for the recommendation. I've just talked to them and I'm getting a demo. It looks good on paper, I really hope its can handle what I'm looking for.
Wow, great ! Thanks a lot !
Really great article, thanks!
Very nice plugin!! I really admire people that put more time into making Vim more usable. I've added your plugin to my list here: http://staff.washington.edu/ivanoats/blog/2012/01/13/making-macvim-pretty/
Strange - No one mentioned GEdit (Gnome) or OpenKomodo (Windows, Mac, GNU/Linux...). Both of them are great! OpenKomodo especially deals with tabs and spaces very well. And - it's free. Whee! When I need a lighter weight thingy, I just use GEdit. Download OpenKomodo here -
You are processing the newline character as if it is legitimate input. You should either read the entire line (including the newline, perhaps using a ) and then process the first character of the line or simply add a test to skip newlines in your loop logic.P.S. Converting case by adding or subtracting 32 is a really awful approach. It won't work with anything but a-z and A-Z (in the English alphabet). It won't work for most characters outside the Basic Latin block and shouldn't be used at all for characters that have no alternate case (such as newline). You should be using and instead.
Excellent! It works like this: [code]extern "C" {
shouldn't that be exp(-beta_i u_i) / sum_k exp(beta_k u_k)
excellent! this user agent switcher is a gold mine!
New to programming and this is my very first post! Very exciting:D Thank you all in advance for sharing your expertise. I would like to be able to somehow reference the earlier created timer and to be able to extend it (call Change upon its instance perhaps?) on Button2_Click. Please take a look at the code below:
You could eventually create 1 hf entry per size. For sizes <=32 bits, you can use the same filter name. But for those above 32 bits, you need another filter name (as seen in README.dissector chapter 1.5.1)
This is always a really bad way to design software.
Some file were missing in the last patch sorry.
So only workaround which works for me is to add this js to template of my site..But its really awful solution, since I only need it in one article/module
I agree that a trailing "or" is missing here (though defining a function is_configured and putting the grep's in it would have been better than any commenting. I cannot say that I like duplicating bash logic in English)
Excellent icons on !!! We use them in PerTrainer iPhone application You can see screenshots here: I also found some good icons here: Hope this helps!!!
This isn't going to pass pep8 anyway because this line is too long and the parameters to getattr don't have proper spacing. And why are we still looking at exc.message here?
This is a method in Java, that(when k == 0) in int[] arr has one of k-combination int[] intems. In variable iloczyn is calculated product of elements in this combination. In tmp is calculated sum of all such products. Unfortunately, System.out.println(tmp) shows, that when function ends, tmp equals 0. This is very sad, because i need this variable for next calculations. What shoud I do?
where size is not the issue, and performance is not a big deal like in test, please use range() to mainatain future compat with python3

Got it: I need to reference the class types through the createjs module. i.e. works absolutely fine!
Hate to have to do this, but it works!
Why does the test return false?
There is no putComment method. Shorten this and just put it on one line: checkState(psId != null, "setPatchSetId must be called first"); Developers debugging a failure can look at the Java stack trace to see how they got into this situation. What matters to them more is the call site where the object was misused, not which entry point into the object the error was discovered by.
I think this can be refactored (with the RTU "duplication") into the Modbus dissector.
Works pretty good for me, you perfectionists! (just teasing)
1. This seems like a hack to work around a bug -- why are we reading from the pty after it is closed? 2. This hack also looks too broad -- if any error occurs we close the pipe and stop reading, while squelching the error. This seems bad. Same comments below.
That irritated the hell out of me too but I didn't realise it was configurable in the .launch file.
Sorry if this spam's things however it's unlikely that I'll work on these.
Hudson seems to be stuck on this.
I'd really love the surrounding content to "scroll" up/down in like when using Scroll - but would also love the appropriate div to "fade" in.
That's clever, but the performance must be HORRIBLE. Not that I'm saying there's a better answer, just shuddering at the O(n^2) of it.

Excellent, the selected bit was very useful.
I've done some easy .hover(function() statement in jQuery. When i hover over a text i simply want a #div.fadeIn, and on non-hover fadeOut. It works. But it's just if i spam the text-trigger with hover and un-hoverring really quickly and then stop the animation begin to give a blinking effect. It just kind of loops, really annoying!
The patch went to the wrong bug.

Back in the day I had to solve this with a panel where the text box is a component inside and had DockPadding set to 3 or 4 pixels. I'd then style that panel to a single pixel. I always found this really annoying!

@Mario I disagree, while the answer is outrageously awful, it's still an answer.
This sucks badly.
thx for that, really great answer!
Currently making a java program that grabs data off of a MSAccess Database and some of these errors are extremely frustrating. I keep getting this SQL.Exception : Too few parameters. Expected 1 error on the last remaining bugs in this program. Little background on the db: It has 3 tables (A player table (11 columns), a team table (3 columns), and an Opponent table (6 columns). These are both of the functions and I am fairly certain the problem lies in here somewhere or this function
Sweet! Git I love git! :)
Thanks!
No it doesn't. We just have to parse repo-hooks childNodes after the project childNodes. Which you already do above. :-)
Excellent, thanks!
writing a stream manipulator is a very complicated way of doing something very simple!
It'll work, it is just incredibly annoying and spy-ware-esque.
Hi Gregor, Need to make this accessible by adding "class='accessible-hidden'" with relevant details to labels; also add spans for hidden text; anchors with spans; buttons need to have "alt" text; etc. Please refer to: https://wiki.mahara.org/index.php/Accessibility for more details. Thanks, Ghada

It seems that you changed the behavior when there is an overflow. The data of ConstantManager are not longer corrected, thus, it is not possible trying to merge a smaller dex file which does not overflow. Could you upload a separate CL that remove only this feature with figures to see if there is benefits. ? Perhaps, you had some problems with it for parallel dex merging or you think that it was not useful ?
There are many times MDS start/stop, if the client does not umount, then there will recovery waiting every time the MDS start/stop, which is unnecessary for this test.
Is there any way to have a statement across multiple lines without the underscore character? It is really annoying in multi-line strings such as SQL statements, and especially LINQ queries. Beside from the ugliness and difficulty when changing a line (nothing lines up anymore) you can't use comments in the middle of the multi-line statement. Examples of my daily personal hell.
The Async API in http client 4.x really sucks.
There are two cases to be covered: 1) When the tokens are empty (this is the one you did); 2) Also, when you do have 1 comment token but the offset is *before* its begin.
I just use following code right now. The table is MyISAM 90MB. terms has FULLTEXT INDEX and it is varchar(255). There are 1,000,000 rows on the table. I wonder if there is any solution which is more resource usage friendly than fulltext search on MySQL? Especially in terms of memory. By saying solution, I refer to any solution such as other types of databases, table structures etc. and if the solution would be adaptable to a standart VPS or hosting in general, it would be extremely super duper perfect! Thanks for your time!
FEAR!!!!!!!!!!!
the two are not mutually exclusive, archmage.
Agile Development can't be sold using documentations. Instead, ask your management to let you be Agile on a small pilot projet. For this pilot project, you must: - find a motivated end user to help you. - be free not to use the standard developping processes of your company. Then, succeed !!!

You are right. See my update! Make a suggestion pls and I'll catch your thoughts ;)
Sounds like it should be disabled. It is reasonable to run a whole multi-sim workflow (em, equil phases, simulate) in the same set of multi-dirs, so being able to use mdrun_mpi -multidir the-dirs* -deffnm equil-npt would be a nice thing. I haven't tried -multidir with a non-default equil-npt that I remember though. Should we be looking at doing the directory change for -multidir earlier than we do?
FF @ fault? Damn... hate when my buddy fails me.
Why define this as a new function instead of replacing the one that expects a NamedElement? getFuncName is invoked on actions, but also on guards, and we need to apply the new naming on guards as well. If we replace the old getFuncName with this one, but keeping the NamedElement parameter, we can move the "translator.getSource" part here and be able to reuse the same function without modifying the ActionDeclarationGenerator or the GuardDeclarationGenerator.
this should be 0. I believe the empty username is a valid name.

@le dorfier - I'm extremely good at complex sql, just not the t/sql ways of doing declares, conditionals, assignment, loops, cursors, etc... Since I don't do it that often, I find myself having to look up simple t/sql examples every time.
We should have a log for non-connect events as well, probably at trace or debug levels.
Hi Gregor, Continuing on from the mandatory system fields, the below code will save the socialprofile data: elseif ($field == 'socialprofile') { // For new social profiles. $classname = generate_artefact_class_name($field); $profile = new $classname(0, array('owner' => $userid)); $profile->set('title', $value['socialprofile_profileurl']); $profile->set('description', $value['socialprofile_service']); $profile->set('note', $value['socialprofile_profiletype']); $profile->commit(); } Thanks, Ghada
Ahhh! I just made num_rows work (even though I don't need it, as you pointed out) because of your indirect help! Thanks you sweetheart!
Because we don't need anything that it provides (checking that the value is not None and encoding it) so there's not much point pulling it out of the loop below. Actually, we would have to leave it in the loop below as well since it uses the `env' outer variable.
Devexpress have a good one: The RangeTrackBarControl control extends the functionality provided by the TrackBarControl enabling end-users to select a range of values. Two sliders can be used to set the minimum and maximum values: you can get them free from: hope this helps!
old question, but if anyone finds this through google (as I did) and who does not want to use anchors or jquery; there's a builtin javascriptfunction to 'jump' to an element; and what's even better; according to the great compatibility-tables on quirksmode, this is !
Great descriptions of all the answers !
FWIW: After the first Mod, a >= 0. b is already > 0 by definition. So the rest of this code is all done using natural numbers and thus could probably be (slightly) more efficient by using nat's directly. Perhaps next CL.
this is a problem that regularly arises when I write Silverlight XAML. In this case, I've made a usercontrol VerticalTabStop (code attached) that has a ToolTip attached. I instanciate a couple of my usercontrols, and then I get the debugging window and the following error: I get an awful lot of these messages as I hover my mouse over the buttons. Any suggestions to what I'm doing wrong here? Cheers
Pretty self explanatory question. I just don't know how to do it. I've been using Eclipse for about a month so I still have a lot to learn. I'm using the newest version of eclipse Juno and need to push the app (or email it) to my MyTouch. How would I do it from eclipse, as that is the way I would prefer? If I should just email it, would I email the whole project folder or just a particular piece of code? I thank you for all your help in advance. This site has been so incredibly helpful!
It would be a good practice to have a separate button that will disable method since it is very easy to get confused when using your program if the code for disabling and enabling this method is all written in one method named so I suggest you separate them to make the program's design more precise.Next thing you can do is to execute a , whic you are going to mark as . After having done this you can use .Here's how: Be warned that it's sometimes dangerous to throw exceptions as it creates some other bugs, but this option won't hurt much if you're just trying to disable a function. By the way, this will really not remove the method as it will just replace it, it's now up to you to choose which method will receive this. Hope this was helpful!
Excellent ! It works !
mdrun -nstlist > 0 is not affected by this change, it will still change nstlist. Or do you mean to add a note even with nstlist=0? nstlist=0 is explained as guess and 1 with 1 seems ok to me.
I created public and private key with cygwins ssh and pasted the public key into bitbucket account. says the ssh connection works fine! (so it should work!!!) Then I post into mercurial.ini in TortoiseHg And I post Into the hgrc file. But then when I want to push TortoiseHg says to me: Seems to me something is missing here but what exactly? Edit: I don't want to used TortoisePlink because it is SUPER SUPER SUPER SLOW! And https just cancels the connection after uploading several megabytes.
Mika Tuupola: If you are Interested in my modified jeditable (added two callback events), you can . It would be great if you would provide these events in your official version of jeditable!

Wide lines are a #@$# in most diff'ing tools as well, which can make code reviews a pain.
In my company, we are currently using Qt and are very happy with it. I personnally never had to move a MFC-app into using the Qt framework, but here is something which might be of some interest for you : It's part of Qt-Solutions, so this means you'll have to buy a Qt license along with a Qt-Solutions license. (edit: ) I hope this helps !

Thanks Alexei the patch is fine.
I can't parse the part between this comma and the next one.
I hope fortune favors the brave :)
No, because this file and this macro is also used from plain C code, which only accepts this form of casting. Adding #ifdefs just for this purpose does not seem useful.
Nope, forgot to cherry-pick that one. Thanks for noticing, fixed.
I would like to rewrite in C++, but that requires all the calling programs to be C++ too. Will do that in a separate patch.
Sweet :) Happy hacking!
That's just a 16 character requirement with an optional 2 character afterwards: The parentheses may not be required - I'm not enough of a regex guru to know offhand, I'm afraid. If anyone wants to edit it, do feel free...
the name is very generic; yet what it does is just poll for updates. The problem goes away if the script moves to vdsm-tool.
These will not jump: They are, however, soul destroying and extremely ugly.

How does one make M-( the default behavior for typing an opening "(" character? I want Emacs to automatically insert the closing ")" after the cursor when I type a "(" character regardless of whether it's part of an M-key combination. Additionaly, I want to extend this behavior to quotes, subquotes, brackets and braces. Typing M-( is a pain, and there don't appear to be any comparable forms for those other characters.
Hmm...VS is telling me this is already a string? Guess it's lying!
I misunderstood the case and sorry for the confusion.
Jeff Atwood says: February 12th, 2009 at 6:50 am No, weâve switched to a dedicated task. We definitely outgrew this technique. I do think itâs fine for small sites though!
This example contains both actual examples ("refs/*") and metalanguage ("permission"). Maybe pick one representation and stick to it? [access "<ref>"] <permission> = group Administrators or [access "refs/*"] read = group Administrators (Open re what formatting to apply to metalanguage.)
Sorry guys... :( I was the reason for this trouble.
could this moved to config.h instead of having it on the command line?
We've deployed 's Plot Pack in both ActiveX and .Net flavors with great success. Great API, incredibly flexible, provides a toolbar that lets users pan/zoom/customize. It's solid, has a long track record, relatively inexpensive, and is very fast. (I'm not affiliated, by the way.)
Comment is inaccurate (the code assumes stripe offset is set). /* Make sure stripe offset is in OST list. */
I'm trying to make a link inside the fancybox single image title. I want it to redirect me to another fancybox window (witch is inline)... I have a script that makes the whole single image a link, but this targets my document title instead of the anchor title... I really hope someone will have a solution or a better idea on how to do it!! :) Thank you thank you thank yooou! :) btw: I have almost never worked with scripts.. In depth anyways...
You should fix the libraries that are creating bad or non-named threads. I'd hate to debug your libraries' threads only to find that the names where changes elsewhere.
Doubles aren't compared that way in real life...
I second FlashDevelop. You don't get the visual design stuff for the MXML, but for the code (both MXML and AS) it's excellent.
i think we're better off just taking the auto-generated stub like we did in the original patch. it doesn't hurt anyone that there's dead code at the end because the syscall never returns, and it's arguably more confusing to be insisting on supplying our own stub.
At least put // @todo something. Helps us keep track of what still needs to be looked at in the codebase.
Wow! I have an idea of cool web 2.0 app, and i will share it with you now. Do you remember this xkcd strip: So, imagine the web-service on which high-school students list people they dated (links to facebook profiles or smth), and the service provides recommendations whom to date next to create symmetric graph or any other fancy graph configuration.
I created a mobile application with the yeoman mobile-generator. I'am very new to grunt and yeoman, but it's really awesome stuff! Does anyone know what I have to do add a banner to my generated files? Where I have to use this. I have tried something like this, but does not affect. ...
I got it.. this is incredibly silly question! Static means I just access it directly from Without using it from the instance.
Few things to make this work :Your classname FILE should start with a capital letter, Your config array must be defined as $config = array() (and not $var or any other name), Your config file must be lowercase.The config file is passed through the constructor, so class ($config=array()), you can then access and store the config variables on an instance variable. hope it helps: config file : good luck :)
missing a comma here, can you help adding it back? ;)
This was my bad.

Gosh ! you're right !!! Excellent !!!! Is there a way to expand it programatically ? I added .setOngoing(true) (to the top) but it's not expanded... (not really the top because the first one is a notification when I'm plugged to USB for tools developpement ). Thank you again my friend !
#ERROR!
Great! Awesome work Nick and thanks for the clarification Bill.
this worked excellently, great job! :)
When specified as above, Spring distinguishes constructor arguments by order of appearance. The notation would only switch between setting the attributes by constructor to setting them by accessor. I'm afraid, this will not change anything.
Sorry for that.
I'm a novice programmer who is attempting assembly for the first time. Sorry in advance if this is an incredibly lame question. I have a character stored in the EAX register, but I need to move it to my DL register. When I try: mov dl, eax I get an error C2443: operand size conflict. I know that the eax register is 32 bit while the dl is 8 bit... am I on to something?? How do I go about solving this.
Should this call Free(), or just remove Free() and put that code in here?
Actually I don't want to specify the encoding because I don't care how the data is transported to me.
planning to do that in a separate changelist for MB-14866: 1. merge lock with seqno_list into the same structure 2. maintain a vbMap instead of vbList in this service, so as to make vbno lookup/validation faster 3. do vbno validation in all relevant places in the service you mentioned that we could use list of list instead of map of list to avoid issues with map. Feel that it makes the code harder to read. we may have to understandard the behavior with maps anyway. Plan to make the changes above and see if the issue in MB-14866 re-cur.
I am aware of question, but not to sure how to map it to my current situation. (Rebase is scary, undoing rebase is double scary!) I started out with several different feature branches of my master: I wanted to merge them all together and check they worked before merging back onto the top of master, so I did a: Then Which leaves me with Then I corrected some bits that didn't compile properly, and got the whole feature set to an acceptable state: My problem is that my colleagues tell me that we're not ready for FeatureA. Is there any way for me to keep all my work, but also revert to a situation where I can just rebase FeatureC on to Feature B?

Thank you Gumbo, I suppose this'll have to do. I would've liked a more concise solution but thank you anyway, I never knew this js-uri class existed!
cpu_allocation_ratio is a global config option fro the core filter - not a per hypervisor setting ?
this doesn't make too much sense to me, as this file lives in the same directory (hence double quotes). and the use of double quotes with private/ is inherently bogus.
That would be great! @Heinz: contact established :-)

I have just read and I really loved to the question. Naturally, an interesting question popped in my head... How to add my own events (of my own applications) in the Control Panel -> Sounds and Audio Devices -> Sounds -> Program Events? And another related question, that I suppose should be answered here as well is... How do I play those sounds specified in the Control Panel, when the event in my application occurs?
leave it defined here, just declare it extern in the header, otherwise each file that includes packet-usb.h will get its own copy
Sorry I tought I could commit this patch but I did not realize that one of the files is in the framework (and I have not access to it).
Sorry we are no longer using Xerces.
You could look at using , but performance might be completely horrible.
Sorry yes I believe this has been resolved.
excellent, good luck!
I think the correct resolution is to ensure that the prefix stack mechanism gets reset each time the XMLReader is used.
I think we use spaces instead of tabs after variable name (all @foo above).
The is an excellent resource for locale data. From the website you can download an xml version of the database, which includes datetime formats, number formats, and lots of other locale specific data.
you handle all these exceptions in the same way so you can use multi-catch: } catch (RevisionSyntaxException | AmbiguousObjectException | IncorrectObjectTypeException | IOException e) {

Is there any practical reason to skip class literals in JsInterface chains other than code size? Please add an explanation here.
If this is never called - then we need to remove the method, it's signature in the header, and all call-sites for it (right?).
Could you also update RELEASE_NOTES.markdown in the project root. You are adding interfaces, it would be great to document them there.
But I will quit committing to Hama then because I'm not going to support ONLY a binary format.
This might be a bug indeed.
I'm trying to create a grid (matrix) of squares in a given area with n columns and m rows, and an option to set a spacing between the squares if desired. The grid should fill squares with random coloring. I'd also like to add a zoom function, so the colored squares will appear much bigger in a region that is double-clicked. Can anyone suggest a good method to generate the grid and assign random colors to the squares? If you can suggest how to create the zoom effect too that would be SUPER :) I'm new to canvas, so any method help would be great! Thanks
I realise this is probably an absolutely horrible way to do a query, and of course its not working. The point of it is to select users based on a date range and a keyword.

I've got a form for sellers to input their PayPal API credentials, but I need a way to validate them by making some sort of call to PayPal. I'm using the PaypalExpressGateway in ActiveMerchant, and I don't see anything other than the standard purchase controls. Is there any sort of null-operation that can be used? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Here's a secret. In the chrome dev tools, do a cpu profile run. After you have stopped capturing, at the bottom of the screen is a down triangle next to "Heavy (Bottom Up)". Click the triangle and select "Flame Chart". Once you are in Flame Chart mode, you can zoom and pan to see the digest cycles, how long they take, and exactly what functions are being called. The Flame Chart is so incredibly useful for tracking down page load issues, ng-repeat performance problems, digest cycle problems! I really don't know how I was able to debug and profile before the Flame Chart. Here is an example:

If a user term isn't returned I believe you'll get NPEs when displaying lists of changes. That's why I wrote https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/35201 so that this error is discovered early and is properly reported. I was a while since I looked at it, and the code might've changed since then, so don't take my word for it.
@R.. Wow! Really great answer!! You should post it as an answer here, as it's really more precise. Just a question, though, when you say round for the alignment of the type, you mean that if for example on your example you had a short b instead of int b,
I think should this be translated(m_xOffset, m_yOffset) instead, because adjusted(x1,y1,x2,y2) will make the rectangle grow
And on that note, if there is a library out there that does, that will do fine :)
Since BE was IE10 (as of the member var above) I think changing the member to edge is not a problem, but I would keep the IE8 default here, which does not hurt us, and will also not hurt third party stuff then.
Instead of putting everything in the collector and then looping through later when outputFormat==JSON why not switch here on outputFormat and thus allow results to be printed immediately for JSON and collected only for JSON_SINGLE?
The named scopes already proposed are pretty fine. The clasic way to do it would be:
If you don't mind working at a slightly lower level, httplib2 () is an excellent HTTP library that includes caching functionality.
No need for Provider here, inject FlushCashe directly. Both PostCaches & FlushCache are singletons. So the Provider hurts more than it helps here. E. g. on line 105 it get called in a loop and returns allways the same singleton instance.
I am writing a WsCF service to retrieve data for multiple clients. I have a service layer that references business manager objects. In essence on the service call, I want to retrieve the provider type (a custom enum in my code) and the connection string from the web.config. For some reason, the code is unable to find the settings in my project web.config. I am gathering the IIS Express AND the VS development web server are referencing the machine.config. How do I override this. It is extremely frustrating. As you can see from the snippet the setting AND the connection string name exist, but the code never picks it up. My code: Private Sub GetDBInformation() The web.config:

I'm new to ror and am finding the scattered documentation extremely frustrating! When the commands rails generate model or rails scaffold are any fileds automatically created. I'm thinking here about the Id field in particular. Additionally, could anyone point me to the documentation which specifies this?
FYI this probably doesn't always work. Booleans are stored as CHAR(1) with value Y for true and N for false. Not every JDBC driver out is going to grok this as a boolean value. It would be safer to use "Y".equals(rs.getString()) in code such as this. Can't this statement also be written as an UPDATE: UPDATE accounts SET reverse_patch_set_order = 'Y' WHERE display_patch_sets_in_reverse_order = 'Y'; UPDATE accounts SET show_username_in_review_category = 'Y' WHERE display_person_name_in_review_category = 'Y'; This should be much faster to process, and every SQL server we support will grok those two small statements. And it avoids the problem with boolean conversion.
With auto-generated CRUD methods you don't need to define these methods manually. Please check this patch https://review.openstack.org/#/c/62865/

You have a potential problem here with MMCONF_SUPPORT. This option indicates hardware has PCI-e config register access in MMIO space in addition to the legacy 0xcf8/0xcfc IO registers. A second option MMCONF_SUPPORT_DEFAULT is not set, so by default you would use PCI IO config access. But since those are non-atomic, SMI handler in i82801ix explicitly uses MMIO and you have no MMCONF_BASE_ADDRESS set.
Rebol (600 Ko only) is based on antigrain geometry library which is Opensource It seems really great, can OpenGL do better ?
That's what I was thinking, but I am afraid it will bring confusion to the structure. I will need to add "Set children" field to parent class which should not be used anywhere in the code, only for hibernate cascade deletion. Do you think it is ok?
I meet the same problem on Eclipse recently but haven't figured out how to get through.
All I'm trying to say is that it's pretty easy to end up in propagation failure hell here or change something else that blows things up for use cases that are not foreseen.
sorry this bug is *not* fixed.
Will take a look after we decide how to move forward.
magnus, to write something along the lines of this is the number of sets of the most frequently written output type per frame set. the best default will need some experimentation. ideally this would be a user-configurable option, but it is not clear whether a (hidden) command-line option would be best (or env var), and not clear whether anybody would really use it in practice. Disk is cheaper than user and/or compression time, for the most part. So we'll add a TODO to reconsider for 5.1(?) and not before.
Prefer ordered includes, i.e. VTK headers, vtksys headers, STL/system headers.
I have an .ico file with 5 icon sizes embedded in it being used as the main application icon and the System Tray icon. When it shows up in the task bar the icon is using the 16x16 format which is desired. When the icon shows up in the Notification Area/System tray, it is using the 32x32 format and Windows is rendering it down to a 16x16 icon, which looks horrible. How do I force windows to use the 16x16 icon size in the notification area? Here's my code to put the icon in the system tray:
I've searched this and cannot find it. I've tried different plugins and different browsers (Firefox, Opera, and Chrome). I've tried most of the no flash plugins for each of those as well as disabling Flash plugins/addons in the settings. I also renamed the file in i found by searching the system. when i renamed it, makes Firefox and Chrome ask to install Flash, but still: returns: I'm not sure what else to try without uninstalling Flash, but that will be a total pain in the ass for this. I also REALLY don't want to use SWFObject just to see if Flash is at all installed which I can do simply with: Any ideas?
First: I like your approach of being concentrated on a clean and proper state handling of your application.Excellent! But, as you said: Android can kill activities and manage their lifecycle for itself. The OS may release memory allocated for your activity as soon as possible requiring you to allocate it again. This means your fragment may or may not get destroyed. As you can see in your stack trace, FragmentActivity.onCreate is called.This obviously inddicates your existing resources created within the context of the old activity are not access - able anymore. The only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context. For all other resources you should be aware and handle properly that created resources may be invalid at the time you are trying to access them.
Note that this doesn't use a StringBuilder, so will have horrible performance for very long sequences.

I can't believe that answer from a company. Horrible!
Thanks a lot Kiran for the patch.
I think the question is valid. I agree with the other responses, but it doesn't mean it's a terrible question. I've only ever had to use a Safari CSS hack once as a temporary solution and later got rid of it. I agree that you shouldn't have to target just Safari, but no harm in knowing how to do it. FYI, this hack only targets Safari 3, and also targets Opera 9.
Sorry I kind of forget about this one.
Excellent, Thanks!
Awesome, super fast! Thanks a bunch =)
Sweet :) Happy hacking!
not worth including the regular version number too?
I'm using Rob Con's repository pattern also - absolutely love it. But i'm not worrying about concurrency checks. I load the most recent object, then update the fields the submitchanges. I would look at seeing if you could use the Attach and/or timestamps. It's been a while since i've looking into linq + concurrency.
I installed Delphi 2009 Update 4 yesterday (very painful process ) Now, How can I make sure if it is properly updated? What is the build number shown in the IDE about box?

This bootmode is allover the place in ACPI too. I was considering doing enum with follow-up later.
Ahh, I didn't know that the wsdl command line utility could generate one file for many asmx.... thats awesome! I'll try that out now. I can integrate that into our build process too. Great, thank!
My solution for at indexes and of any string would be: If this evaluates to True it means that the character at index x is enclosed by a set of parentheses. You can test for the index y respectively Hope that helped, Cheers! Alex

I have a controller which has a few actions, which are triggered by hitting various buttons on the page. I would like to have a default action, but am unsure how to annotate the method. Here is an example: How can I annotate a method which will act on a POST with any submit button pressed with no key selected? I have tried: I'd really hate it if I had to set required = false on each of the methods which take RequestParams and then conditionally check to see if one comes in or not... Is there a way to annotate this to work properly?
I would replace this line by $noteids = array_keys($data); as $data is associate array with key = 'id'

The list of maintainers seems to be organized alphabetically by translator name. I guess tiering should be listed after quota.
I have an Android app that looks absolutely horrible if the user sets their font size to large or extra large (via Settings -> Display -> Font size in Ice Cream Sandwich). It just plain wasn't designed for variable font sizes, and it makes a lot of the text unreadable. I've seen applications that preserve the font size for most views, so I know that there has to be a way to do this. Is there a simple way for me to tell the application to ignore the user's font size preference? And if there isn't, how would you suggest that I go about calculating the font sizes? If nothing else, is there a way for me to retrieve the user's font size preference?
Because it's racy. It should be guarded optimally with a lock that is not so global, but then you're talking about improvements that are in the nanosec granularity.
Excellent! Look forward to hearing from you.
tricky shit man! I think I found the issue!
Thanks Awdesh - Done at r821748.
This condition is always true. I assume the condition you meant was n != ptrSize. Though I see you removed this condition altogether in CL 9704 (rebase failure?).
You have to created a new model for hold referral code. below are given model syntax. add These lines in your last lines your models.py Above mention line will create your user profile at the time of creating user.Hope this work for you!!!
TableID is specified to be 8 characters. While the original version broke that by adding a space, I guess it's simply ignored. With this change, the final "M" would be dropped, too. (When you fix that, also cut OEMID to 4 characters, it's 32bit. ACPI5.0 19.5.28)

When you move a host to maintenance then that calls disconnectStorageServer which should remove this definition so in general this shouldn't affect anything negatively. The case where this would remain is in case of an error flow where for some reason it wasn't disconnected properly or something. Even if that happens, it's not that interesting as a few leftover connections shouldn't affect the host negatively (think about FC where the host is always connected). The advantage is that most of the time (since hosts don't move between DCs very often) the host would automatically reconnect whenever it reboots (e.g. due to sanlock fencing) and it would be available to engine almost immediately reducing recovery time. Imo that is more important. See oVirt Bug 881941 - After a reboot of both engine and vdsm domains take a long time (15 minutes) to recover

Actually it's not as bad as it looks - Perl's File::Copy is horribly broken (for example it doesn't copy file permission on Unix and other stuff), so many "high profile" hackers actually use system('cp', $target, $destination) or similar stuff

How is determined which of the opcodes is actually taken during import of _xlfn.CEILING.MATH ? I think that's missing. Note that now that we use RID_STRLIST_FUNCTION_NAMES_ENGLISH_OOXML with the formula compiler, the tables in sc/source/filter/oox/formulabase.cxx are only provided for API support (of which we actually don't know if anyone is using it at all). Our internal OOXML import/export doesn't use them anymore, so any "only for import / only for export" usage needs to be implemented differently.

The phpdoc states that an array is returned. Would it be better to return an array() instead of NULL?
Will take a look after we decide how to move forward.
No worries found it! I clicked on the little button on the top right of this
Daryn the current patch looks good.
Don't hate me just throwing this out there.
This is more obvious in this file than the other. You should be escaping the periods in your regular expressions. I know that it will match the period in the URL anyway, but we want it to *only* match the period. Also, you should use specific matches for scid, height and width, rather than the period (match anything). Assuming that you're just matching numbers, '[0-9]+', or tentatively '\d+' would be better here. One more thing, if these sites provide copy-and-paste embed tags, these matches will need to be able to deal with those too - currently they look like they will just modify the URL in-place, and this is definitely not what we want.
Hi, so should we keep this as "local" or change to "mergeStrategies"?
i assume that the reason that the copyright is updated now is because the file was updated in 2011, but the copyright wasn't.
You should really check out this plugin: I have been using it for about 10 sites and it's really great! Since the latest update it's posible to export your custom fields to a PHP file which you can include your functions.php
Why does the test return false?
who uses this method ? I don't see why this is useful. I'd just get rid of this method and the associated field. Once you do that, you can just collapse this class into a single static method (runAll) and get rid of the Pair class.
Its absurdly late/early so maybe I'm just tired, but can anyone tell me why in the world the following test is not failing? Really need a second pair of eyes to confirm I'm not crazy...now I'm worried that all my tests are unreliable.
Need to use: with self.assertRaises(ex.NotSingleNameNodeException): validator.validate(cluster)
Damn Chuck is scary.
Excellent - thanks !

I absolutely hate cluttered seed files. Admittedly, it's a personal preference and not a right or wrong. Here's what I did in my app at work to handle the significant volume of seed data we are required to use: My seeds.rb file: A sample seed file in the seeds/ folder: This has the effect of loading our seed files in the desired order (using 01_ then 02_, etc.). It also breaks up our seeds into logical groupings and organizes them in such a way that, for our team, we can more easily manage them.
Excellent! Thank you for your perseverence :)
Patch Set 1: Fails (1 inline comment) I just tried this change on tot gavd on my waluigi and it didn't detect headphone insertion. I went back to just tot, the change renaming udev_listen -> udev_sound, and it does work. I know the commands for alsa were not flushed out yet in the max98095 codec, is that the problem right now?
This was very bad documented.
I've been experimenting with Linq to see what it can do - and I'm really loving it so far :) I wrote some queries for an algorithm, but I didn't get the results I expected... the Enumeration always returned empty: case #1 I changed the query declaration to be inline like this, and it worked fine: case #2 Does anybody know why it doesn't work in case #1 ? The way I understood it, the query wasn't evaluated when you declared it, so I don't see how there is a difference.
I'm building a little framework with Node.js, and I would try to use data from an API but I don't know why it doesn't work (asynchronous but ??). Some advices could be very great ! By the way, I tried with xmlhttprequest too. Thanks for your help !
What the hell?!
Excellent and simple.
This file now has Windows line endings. @Jan: Could you verify that you have core.autocrlf=input configured in your Tycho repository clone?
So only workaround which works for me is to add this js to template of my site..But its really awful solution, since I only need it in one article/module
+1 for not being afraid to ask
Excellent, Thanks!
Let's imagine something like this: Later I can do something like this: Is there any way I can set the limit when using the named query, and not when defining it? I'd would really love to do something like: or Thx in advance! :-)
My bad.
Very painful and doesn't work with inputs from the user.
Thank you for the excellent answers! @ArnoldSpence is correct: It is indeed a case of memory fragmentation. I confirmed this by modifying my example above to allocate a series of 49 MB buffers after the reaching the "OUT OF MEMORY" condition. Sure enough, these all succeeded (up to the 2GB limit).
This is the line which triggers the crash. createQmlObject() requires the calling context to be valid. If this callback is invoked from C++ via the event loop, it has a chance to crash. Note that using Damian's repro also uncovered a crash in QNetworkAccessFtpBackend::closeDownstreamChannel() which could hide the crash issue in QML, but that's a separate issue which needs to be tracked separately (the fix is trivial, just a null ptr check on the ftp ptr).
absolute is still wrong.
For the current situation: core plugins are developed by core team, experimental - developed by PI and Mos-Engineering teams. In the future: core plugins - certified by Mirantis, experimental - verified by Mirantis, and thirdparty - other plugins.
In our eternal quest to integrate Javascript into our RSpec and Cucumber workflow we're evaluating and are provisionally very excited about it. Any advice on Culerity in general or specifically as compared to Selenium?
yes, that's the point: if it's a *designer* plugin, it needs to depend on designer, as in the other example. but this is a ui loader/widget plugin only.
Tabs are evil.
Not related, but may be better to move to constructPorperty(String suffix) or something like that.
No, because this file and this macro is also used from plain C code, which only accepts this form of casting. Adding #ifdefs just for this purpose does not seem useful.
I did not have time to do it yesterday.
A unit test should do the same thing every time that it runs, otherwise you may run into a situation where the unit test only fails occasionally, and that could be a real pain to debug. Try seeding your pseudo-randomizer with the same seed every time (in the test, that is--not in production code). That way your test will generate the same set of inputs every time. If you can't control the seed and there is no way to prevent the function you are testing from being randomized, then I guess you are stuck with an unpredictable unit test. :(
Original edited patch was messed up... stupid sed!
Makes completely sense. Put the content there more in case any other folks want a quick place to find it outside of the developer pages. That said, if you do find a specific solution, please share as I am very interested! Am working on building an AppEngine app and utilizing Maven with similar characteristics as yours this weekend!
Awesome, super fast! Thanks a bunch =)
That's impossible to say until somebody invests the time and effort to try lots of different function approximations on that architecture to see if they can come up with something better. For now it is the fastest approach.
I don't know how the hell my diff program decided to add seemingly random CR chars but I've removed them now.
Inserting timestamps automagically would be bad because it would limit a whole swath of use cases.
This should be a programlisting with language 'ini'
Stupid user error :)
I added an example of how to use the wrapText function. Good luck with your project!
@Almo @trojanfoe yes it was a horrible syntax error, sorry guy's!
Release after main inode is what patchset 2 has done I think.

This is excellent! :)
Yeah, major documentation work in the next few weeks, so we can all use our time more efficiently when new or wasn't-paying-attention-then developers come on board. Today, only worried about completing the rc while not creating repeat work later! :-)
Awesome! Thanks.
I'm an idiot... there's nothing wrong with the readme.txt.

I do not understand... I am not trying to fix the world now... all I need is to ask vdsm what is its id without having to deal with handling the /etc/vdsm/vdsm.id are the above valid to this task? the new code of vdsm-reg will call vdsm-tool vdsm-id --force and get id no matter if it is uuid or generated from anywhere else, this id is required for registration. if you then want to improve how it is 'generated' you are welcome to do so, it will not break the interface.
+1 for actually *answering* the question.
Why does the test return false?
+1 from me, I loved the leap from MFC to Qt ;)
Thank you, the first example was extremely helpful and I now have it working, thanks!
Ah sorry I misunderstood you.
Sorry we are no longer using Xerces.
this should be done (if any) when first connection is established. and I do think that it is a mistake to do so. please move all the engine variables into engine side, do not modify options, there is no technical need to do so. this includes the destination address and destination port. let's makes lives easier for us. if you call the variable the same, you can even have same file symlinked at /etc/ovirt-engine/engine.conf.d and /etc/ovirt-engine/fence....conf.d/ to provide the same options. So you can even consider putting it at engine local config. But please avoid complexity result from database updates, and move the variables to the component that actually use them.
The plan of making a mum/dad accessible UpgradeYourBrowser page was growing for me the last few days, but now caffeine and this bug just filled me with angry rage (the green kind)
That will unfortunately only work if there are no 4-core Intel Xeons that work in dual-socket configuration because we could confuse a workstation that has two such processors with an 8-core Xeon E5 in single-socket configuration.
Hi Henry Thanks for checking it out.
or ask the maintainer to commit the change on the author's behalf.
i'm very concerned that this is done at non-obvious place. it will be hard to observe that RPCs are found "replied" late in our context. we don't have any tests for this. if something is changed, then when we'll notice?
Too awesome! This actually answered an unasked question of mine, how to stop people from cutting off others in my corporate meeting.
excellent, all working now, thanks !
Just put "Sync groups in these contexts only" as field text. And put the rest in a note beneath the text field: "Note: Leaving this field blank, the user authentication contexts will be used." Help needed to let admins know how they need to enter the context.
I think that's just a mistake in make.bash. It's better to fail fast and minimize distractions to stderr when you know you've already lost. I'd say add an exit failure here and then submit. If you feel strongly about keeping it as-is, you can submit this too and we can fix them both later if we decide to.
I have discovered a mode in , where I can instantly change all same variables. When I am in this mode I get a box around the same variables and I can change one and instantly all others change. I do not know how to enter this mode "by will", I just entered it "randomly". Therefore, I really appreciate your suggestions, how to enter this mode, because it is extremely useful to me! PS.: I am using NO plugins, just a plain new eclipse installation with java!
I'm using MongoMapper and am trying to come up with a way to use an abbreviated field name. I want to keep the keys as plain english but have the field names stored short (e.g. "name" maps to "_n"). I noticed a conversation but it ended up closed () and I was wondering if anybody has an example of how to accomplish this. I'd be extremely grateful for any feedback!
Nitpick: The pointer is only set in the ctor, so it should be const. Similarly in KEY2StyleContext.
This is quality work.
This should be a programlisting with language 'ini'
The prevalence of memory leaks in programs with manual memory management kind of disproves your thesis that it's easy to establish upper bounds of a C/C++ programs's space usage. That said, excellent question!
I have a VB.NET MDI WinForms app. My users have been complaining about form creep (as they call it), this is where each time you open a specific form within the main MDI window it opens slightly below and to the right of the location it loaded previously - i.e. it starts in the top left of the window and works its way down to the bottom right. I have to agree with them that this is extremely irritating, is there any way to prevent this? The code to load the forms is: I can address this somewhat by setting the forms start-up positions to 'Manual' but then they just open directly on top of each other in the top left of the screen. Any other SO users come across this?
Designing with Web Standards is a great first read!

I'm pretty familiar with PGP, and the way it works. I'd like to include some functionality in a project, but so far my research has left my head spinning. What I'd like to do is create a public key with a defined private pass phrase. From there, I'd share the public key with someone where they can then encrypt a message using the key and return it to me where I can decrypt. I envision the code looking something like this. To generate my private pgp key: To encrypt I'd give my shared key to a friend: To decrypt the encrypted string after being sent back to me: Obviously I know I'm skipping out on a ton of details. Through my research I've seen references to libraries like Bouncy Castle and Spongy Castle. Any help would be hugely appreciated!
I just updated my MacVim to 7.3 and with it, it now changes directories to whatever file I'm currently editing. I use PeepOpen, so it's incredibly annoying to cd back to my project directory every time I want to edit a new file.
Wow! Actually, that's nearly what @MarkSeemann wrote, but in code :) Hope that helps.
This is always a really bad way to design software.

I am trying to generate API documentation via cabal and haddock. I want it to be latex. So I do: This fails ultimately with: Is there something I can do or is something wrong with haddock? FYI, I have to use cabal since the build process is rather complicated (lots of preprocessors, ffi libraries, ...). Invoking haddock manually is really painful. Building HTML documentation however is working completely as expected. The complete output is at . I am using:
found a solution, would still love to see alternatives!
I really liked your approach to it! I found that changing the code to the following made my progressbar update correctly. I had some issues while using math.round().

Excellent answer, thanks! Wish I could give you more points.
no sorry - priorities have been shifted around...

Committed a slightly cleaned up version of the patch in revision: 1464605 Thanks for your help Todd.
So I'm trying to write a RR Rotation and LL Rotation with Java for an AVL tree. I have most of it figured out, however I don't know where I should modify the height within the method. I've been trying to understand it for a few days here but I cannot figure out where exactly it would go in the method I currently have. If someone could help explain exactly where I should put the modifications for the height of the node (it uses getLeft/setLeft for it's left height and getRight/setRight for it's right height) it would be extremely helpful!
Can anyone think of a quick, easy and fullproof way of listing only ClearCase Remote Client views from UNIX? ct lsview obviously lists all the views, and you could search by looking at the Properties: section if you run a ct lsview -properties -full (gives you Properties: snapshot webview readwrite) then use a regex or something, but I'd be worried that someone calls their view 'webview' or something. Has anyone got a foolproof way? Am I missing a flag or something? If only there was -fmt on lsview :S
great great great, that's what I was looking for !
I don't think there is an easy way to do this, but it feels like these error messages should be shared with the ones from the WUI (ApprovalTable).
setPageTitle() takes a Message, so no need to change anything here.
Its Ajax, I dunno anything about it. And looking at the link which you have given seems very scary to understand and implement.
Please look at https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Checking_for_JGit_API_Changes_using_API_Baseline I suggest you setup API checks. They give a lot of warnings here about missing @since tags etc.
it was very helpful :)
why do we json_encode() $scopeData here? We do not do this in the base class. Furthermore it is already serialized. The only difference in this method compared to the one in the base class is now the Tree.thisScript stuff. The question therefore is: Is this a bug in the baseclass that Tree.thisScript is not set, or is it superfluous here? If neither applies, then still the question remains, if there's a nicer way of adding this code snippet without overriding (and copyiing) the complete method from the base class?
Excellent! This is exactly what I needed. Thanks!
+1: I just used implemented this, it works great!
This is simply the tip of the WTF iceberg I'm exposing with this question. The rest of the app, and the purpose for its very existence is more painful, if you'll believe it.
I screwed up the encoding of the stopwords file (sorry).
I think that this should be removed, and phdr->len and phdr->caplen needs to be incremented by 1 + 16 instead (see other comments below).
The error occurs because is looking in the wrong environment (i.e., not inside the data frame). You could explicitly specify the but that would be ugly, awful code. Much better to use as Iselzer suggests.
Try replacing... with.. Best of luck, hope that helps!
It is pretty inconsitent. Some have very short descriptions (like this one) others only point to the jdk doc (which is what I will do). Big TODO update all url pointers.

@R.. Wow! Really great answer!! You should post it as an answer here, as it's really more precise. Just a question, though, when you say round for the alignment of the type, you mean that if for example on your example you had a short b instead of int b,
Excellent, I'll check that out later, looks promising, thanks!
Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved I concur with jrbarnette@. It sounds like we can do a separate issue/CL for removing the pragma. To that end, I think a TODO() referring to that issue could be useful if added to this CL.
Sorry about that.
We probably should ensure the project is clean before doing this, otherwise a user might lose uncommitted changes they care about: project = Project( manifest = self.manifest, name = path, remote = RemoteSpec('origin'), gitdir = os.path.join(self.manifest.topdir, path, '.git'), worktree = os.path.join(self.manifest.topdir, path), relpath = path, revision = 'HEAD') if project.IsDirty: print >>sys.stderr, 'error: cannot remove %s: uncommitted changes are present' % project.relpath print >>sys.stderr, ' commit changes, then run sync again' else: shutil.rmtree(project.worktree)
if your job is parse the service_profile to then pass it to the driver, just let the driver take care of this directly. Less cross-talk and better separation.
Couldn't this be simplified inline to rebalance_completed () ? Please note rebalance_completed has a bug, you should only check for 'completed' status instead of inversing for 'in progress'.
Of course it could... :-) DOH!
I know this is an old thread but still, I'd like to share one more tool which I find extremely helpful and user-friendly: This is an online tool that will get you up and running in no time. It also features a variety of pretty nice layouts out of the box. Here are two for example:

Deleting files in Xcode does not delete them from installed apps/build folders/etc. It's extremely annoying. If you really want your app to only run in 3.5 inch mode, delete the Default-568 file and make sure to run Clean/Clean Build Folder in Xcode, and delete the app completely off your simulator/device. It should start showing up letterboxed again. Apple is still accepting 3.5in only submissions.
If you dig into the code, at some point you will reach a very strange statement (a couple of calls from setCacheSize), qMax(qMin(.....), 25). The size reported by that might differ from the size specified by the caller, in which case the caller should be informed of that. If you query cacheSize() you will get the value of the variable, not the value that was adjusted after the qMax(qMin...) calls.
For anybody else that is looking for a great tutorial, the is absolutely excellent. It gave me the background for the way an MVC application is designed, and enough to start making my own applications and research to fill in the blanks. Highly recommend this tutorial.

After seeing this live on gerrit-review, I think this is noisy. Every change seems to have 10+ conflicting changes, which I think is just an artifact of there being lots of old, unlikely-to-merge but still open changes in the project.

That's what I was thinking, but I am afraid it will bring confusion to the structure. I will need to add "Set children" field to parent class which should not be used anywhere in the code, only for hibernate cascade deletion. Do you think it is ok?
Okay, so given the overwhelmingly negative response, does anybody think db image storage is _ever_ justified?
That's very sad and the issue was opened a year ago...
I don't care if everything is pretty or not but we should at least support basic admin functionality in IE IMO (though I have not used it for years for just about anything).
I have never use this but looks really great and pretty easy to use !
@Suma How can this be a duplicate if the question you mentioned was posted a year after this one?
because it is terribly difficult to get right. But I mention `boost::iterator_facade`.
Thanks for taking a look Jiannan
Ahh yes. OK. ROMCC and all that. I forgot about that jazz. On further thought w.r.t. the naming. It should really be pcidev_t, no? That would be typedef'd to unsigned int *and* used in struct pci_path? That name would be clearer. Or are we doing to try and encode all different types of devices into a simple_device_t?
Sorry guys I've been pretty busy work but I have been watching this.
#NAME?
I've double checked the (REST) command i used to delete emails. It wasn't a typo because I used the exact same command with an admin user and it worked just fine. It was only when I used the user with canModifyAccount permission that it didn't work. Could the 'not found' message be from the Email.parse() in Email.java requiring Administrator permission?
You may want to carefully examine your assumption about this.
I don't think config can be null. So now you can drop the method. :-)
Use existing $GLOBALS['LANG']->sL('LLL:EXT:lang/locallang_core.xml:show_item.php.uid') with "Uid:" ?
If I am using IIS 7.0 + Server 2008/Vista Enterprise, any ways from IIS 7.0 side to control the upload speed? For example, max upload speed at 1M bytes/second? Any configuration based easy solution is great! And any programming based solution is also appreciated. :-) thanks in advance, George
Sorry [~svenkat] I just committed this.
might as well drop the conditional and just assign it

Thanks a lot Jon for signing up this.
But now that I think about it it may crap out when coming back to read even on a recovered file.
The toolchain file should stop here. It should be about description and setting compilers. Period. See http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Cross_Compiling. I figure the principle is that the toolchain files are somewhat transferable between projects.
Ok, finally got this to work. Horrible documentation online! I'm posting my code in case others are having trouble:
There's already bunch of strcpy calls scattered throughout this file anyways.
Ohhh. I have a white background, so I didn't catch the yellow highlight. Thanks!
Thanks Richard Patch applied to NIO_CHAR module java.nio.CharsetEncoder at repo revision 389784.
No worries! Joe
i have a botton which is for changing the background image with jquery, as the following code shows it works very fine! but i want to fade in the newbg-image... is it possible to add a jquery fade method to it. Any help would be very appreciated. Thanks Ted
We also need to check the return value from wal_commit as well.
If you would like to switch to different network operators - The answer is No, you are not able to do that programmatically. There is no API that supports that. If you want to switch to different wireless networks the answer is Yes, read post. If you would like to check for different kinds of connectivity states - Look . Good luck, hope this helped!
There are an awful lot of C/C++ libraries out there, most no longer updated. There's not much for C#, but I have seen a couple. I haven't really used any of them in anger, so I can't give any recommendations. I would start with and see if you find anything of use there. Alternatively, a search for on sourceforge.net has plenty of results.
This gem is pure gold.
I just caught that, Firefox doesn't preform spell checking on the title field for some reason.
For an excellent event manager class, check Danny Miller's: http://k2xl.com/wordpress/2008/07/02/as3-eventmanager-class-removealllisteners/
I guess I don't need to understand why one is better than the other :)
Just had this happen to me.. very annoying! I am using "Pandora Recovery" to try and restore the files, because I have no other backup.
Ahh, I see. :) I'm not seeing an isEmpty() method for the Cursor class. Should I check for moveToFirst == false instead? Also, while I'm on this, is there a reason we call the CursorLoader parameter CursorLoaderLoader and the Cursor parameter cursorLoader? Can I change them to just cursorLoader and cursor?
You can't move the cursor with JavaScript. It would be incredibly annoying anyways.
Along the same vein of getting the class's METADATA_TYPE when deserializing the response, since you are checking if the METADATA_TYPE is located in the json_dict, you could reference the class's METADATA_TYPE directly. (I should have seen this in the last code review) if DriverInfo.METADATA_TYPE in json_dict: <body> The same applies for the properties keyword check in line 67.
God, that was terrible; I left the link to my library as the one I use for my own server. Should work now... : ) And, Pim, they're not entirely random; the library's for my own personal use, so I tend to just pick letters that make sense to me: [r]eturn, [s]teps, [g]radient, [f]ade count...
Love this solution!
Maybe you could add a real description - yes it's just something really minor :)
I'm working on an iPhone app that will upload images to a web server. I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how to generate unique names for each image file that gets uploaded. I'm sure there are a million ways to do this, but if anyone has any suggestions I'd really appreciate it! Thanks.
No, because this file and this macro is also used from plain C code, which only accepts this form of casting. Adding #ifdefs just for this purpose does not seem useful.
Excellent! Thanks for telling me about this. I'll be watching this.
Firebug is an excellent tool to to show a screen media CSS for some HTML element, but is there a way to look at the print media CSS too? Or is there any other tool to see the print media CSS?
it doesn't leave them; it always removes them. "use specified directory for temporary files"
I would just use an @import command at the top of my CSS file, then you can simply add a new font by adding a pipeline to the end of the font and type the name of any other fonts you want. To use them, simply use the CSS font-family style command: HTML Hope this helped!
Turning off hints is basically intended as a "oh shit something is broken with hints let's turn it off" switch.
The previous one says "server assigned". Is the difference intentional?
@KevinB what an excellent resource! That just made my life waaaaay easier!
___ Yours was very good AND FAST!! thanks for the response ___
prefer to have variables as local as possible. This helps with long-term maintenance. for ( unsigned int i=0; .... { for ( unsigned int j=0; ... { } }
From my own experience, Microsoft SQL Compact Framework is a REAL NO-GO. It is REALLY FREAKING slow and its Query Analyzer is just really poor. I had to ask my team to rewrite all the plumbing code of my Windows Mobile component to get rid of the awful performances of SQL CE.
Hi James This patch has been applied by chirino in the revision 576522 at Sep 17.
(How bad is this?
Here is addendum to fix (Sorry about build breakage)
This is a refactoring from my side that sneaked in when I split the commit. I'll revert this asap since it adds nothing to this change.
Sorry I tought I could commit this patch but I did not realize that one of the files is in the framework (and I have not access to it).
I have this issue where my server and client is creating a lot of loopback threads that I believe must be related to this issue.
I have a small application that I am building a Chat application into, so far I have the functionality to post messages! I don't need a login as there will only be a small number of users and I will use their windows username for identification. Has anyone done anything similiar? What else do I need to add? It doesn't need to be all singing and dancing as it is just for use within a small development team. Any ideas would be great! Thanks
Ahh, I see. :) I'm not seeing an isEmpty() method for the Cursor class. Should I check for moveToFirst == false instead? Also, while I'm on this, is there a reason we call the CursorLoader parameter CursorLoaderLoader and the Cursor parameter cursorLoader? Can I change them to just cursorLoader and cursor?
dict_ref (src->ctx) would ensure that ctx is not destroyed with the destruction of the @src event.
Hey, I saw that you used asyncsocket to get the desired result. Any chance I could pick your brains about this sometime? I'm @suprfrends on twitter. It would be GREATLY appreciated!
Agreed. Unfortunately board-specific modifications to agesawrapper.c files have leaked in, making this a long boring process..
Reuse the ChangeControl instance instead of loading the change again.
Django is a fullstack framework Click is not.
No worries, I know how annoying this stuff can be!
You can look at OpenOffice Base. I tried it out awhile back when it first came out and it seemed awfully slow and it didn't seem feature complete either. But it is free and open source :o)
Excellent, well thought out and worded question. +1, more if it were only possible!
(and even worse, the + or - 10 is dependant on the order of registering the observers!)
In addition to firebug (which should be your first port of call), the will also tell you where a given style is sourced from, just in case IE - shock, horror - should be different.
Does time_sec_to_str "format" the field better than an FT_UINT16? Or does it just add an "s" to the value (which you may want to keep for consistency).
This seems a bit error prone and hacky to me. What if $contentContext->getInaccessibleContentShown() was TRUE before. It would be FALSE afterwards (probably not relevant here, but maybe elsewhere). What about a second argument in "getNode()" that allows to even fetch hidden/protected nodes?
I think that this class makes more sense than the Branch class because there are several places in Gerrit where refs strings are manipulated without using Branch objects. Jgit does define some of those constants, but we cannot use jgit everywhere, particularly in GWT, which I suspect is why this class is here in the first place. We need a good place in Gerrit for these constants, and the Branch object itself is a much higher level object than this simple class (it isn't only about refs, but rather refs and projects). These constants feel more appropriate here to me than in the Branch class. I have some more changes, which I will push, which move them out of the Branch class completely. I am willing to update the comment here if need be, but this class feels appropriate to me (based on its name and location) and I don't think that "naive" comment should get in the way of that.
isn't the client always linux? hmmm... client is a terrible name. i've no idea what i'm looking at here. i was planning on moving those files that currently have "client" in the name. there it seems to mean "device". usb_linux_client is the device-side code, usb_linux is the host-side code. likewise adb_auth. adb_client.cpp doesn't fit this pattern though --- it's a mixture? and for file_sync, client is the *host* and 'service' is the device.
Thanks Suresh.
The Async API in http client 4.x really sucks.
I do not understand... I am not trying to fix the world now... all I need is to ask vdsm what is its id without having to deal with handling the /etc/vdsm/vdsm.id are the above valid to this task? the new code of vdsm-reg will call vdsm-tool vdsm-id --force and get id no matter if it is uuid or generated from anywhere else, this id is required for registration. if you then want to improve how it is 'generated' you are welcome to do so, it will not break the interface.
Would you happen to have another column in your table where you can group them as "1 2 3 4" , "1 2 3 4", etc?It would look something like this:1st column | second columnA | 1B | 1C | 1D | 1A | 2B | 2C | 2D | 2If you order it by 2nd column, it will return 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2. But since you have another column, you can do order by 1st column, 2nd column, and it will be 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2.This ia ofcourse assuming that you have a field like 1st column. But given that you're looking at having them order like 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4, there must be something in your other fields that can help you achieved that Hope this helps!
To expand on my comment, if you don't already see then benefits of relative positioning then I'll assume you are a begginer. Here is a useful video to help you re-design you page: Also, this is useful for comparing when each positioning method is best used: And finally a general website that will be extremely useful for you in the near future may be !
I am crying on the inside. And on the outside.
I'm trying to show a currency dynamicly, that works totally fine! But I'd like to change the pattern from "SFr. 150'000.00" to "150'000.00 SFr." (and still keep it dynamicly!) Any suggestions how I could do that? Here is the code: Thanks in advance!
Sorry this affects 0.9.3 version too.
JLists don't offer a method for this, and that's very sad. Do you know how to do it?
This does not correspond to an issue on the gerrit issue tracker [1]. Issues should be listed in the change footer in the form: Bug: Issue 1234 [1] http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/list
you have create_port function with build in cleanup, it's better to use it
I didn't do that because that seems bad in hive so I returned "null" from the operation.
An excellent and elegant solution. Kudos.
You could look at using , but performance might be completely horrible.
I've just got a quick question about some jQuery/CSS placement. I'm trying to achieve the effect found , but with my CSS, the placement of the objects is totally messed up.

Everything I have so far can be found . JS: } Nothing I do seems to work, and I really hope you can help!

Please use double quotes for EGL/egldefs.h and log/log.h. These headers are now local. Same comment for other files including them.
Malice? Seriously though, it's hard to account for formatting style sometimes. It's largely a matter of personal taste. Personally, I think that both forms are a little nasty unless you're seriously restricted in terms of line-length.
changed to prefix operator++ (and further down in the code, too) I had it mostly coded with date serial numbers, but had to make functions that are available for class Date. I could only find appropiate date serial number functions in the sc/addin/analysis module, a module that I would rather move entirely to the 'normal' calc function module once the Excel-analysis-addin can be considered obsolete. IMHO that would reduce the complexity of the calc-function code. I will peg Date to date serial number conversion as a toDo item on my lo-task stack.
Excellent method and exactly what I need right now. I wish I could upvote this twice.
This TODO will have to wait for a later bug fix, because it's used when users belong to multiple institutions (the progress bar gives them a menu to determine which institution to show, and that relies on the param). It's not a *huge* security issue having this. It just allows users to see what the completion goals are for other institutions they're not members of.
This is how you find the arc length given the parameter, but finding equidistant points requires the inverse of this function. Getting from one to the other is not trivial. @Christian Romo: how did you do it? I mean, you can just use binary search, but that would be horribly slow (for what I'm trying to do, anyway).
I second trying to put the whole path instead. For relative paths, if you're doing compiling and running in command line/terminal, you need to have that studentrecords.txt in the same directory of your code files.If you're using an IDE, you need to put your studentrecords.txt under the src/ folder. This is assuming you're not in maven project setup; otherwise it should be put under /src/main/java/resources/ .Hope this helps!
False is the default, so I suggest we remove it. I've never seen it used before and it just made me scratch my head as to what it was for.
the following code should show either the port or servername not both i always get both no matter what ? i have also tried the follwoing with no joy either !! i just cannot get the condition to resolve thanks in advance
In this case, I'd keep the DoStuff() method but subscribe to it with: Admittedly that won't please those who do all their event wiring in the designer... but I find it simpler to inspect, personally. (I also hate the autogenerated event handler names...)
For C# Visual Studio uses 4 spaces by default, whereas for C++ it is hard-tabs. Why is it so? Why is it different? My project consists of both C# and C++ code and the difference really annoys me. I want to set a common standard for all the sources, but I wonder if this would have any drawbacks.
Well either you query the database every damn time and your plugin/tool/code will be super slow.
Excellent answer, +1!
No, and I would be very afraid if there was.
Thank you Thejas for the patch and Ivan for the review.
Excellent, thanks for that!
This is definitely great for small stuff!
@sjdowling when downvoting someone you are suggested to explain why...
Tried it, loved it. Using it right now.
Sorry I had attached an older version... let's try this one.
I am not really sure what does the receive payment do before the shipment it doesn't sound as if it is doing what we expect it to do.
I'm trying to test if a character in a string is a space, and I'm getting extremely frustrated: I'm not getting any errors and I've looked online, but people on different forums say this is how to test for a space. Uh.
I guess that works, but I'd never do that. It's screaming bad practice. Think about code readability etc.. Come back to your code in six months and figure out all the function calls inside your HTML markup.
Thanks Atul Your patch is in trunk at r933169 I just added some "mod for OFBiz layered lookups" comments around changes as suggested Sascha
I had the problem that white was the "Overscroll" color, not actually the fading edge. try this (assuming you want a fading edge, but not the horrid white glare when you hit the ends! (otherwise set requires fading edge to none)):
Excellent, thanks for reporting back!
Anyone??? I'm starting to hate VS for that reason!
Sorry for the delay and thanks for the good work works like a charm!

If double logins presented, it skipped it... looks so terrible))
@PaulMougel,Thanks Super Great! it works! I added it (res.end()) habitually and have never thought it might could be the reason. Happy New Year. Thank again you so much.
The function is extremely annoying because it uses a prototype or something insane like that. You'd have to do an ampersand-call to override the prototype: .However, you are trying to transpose the matrix, not to it (which would produce a continuous list like We could use an iterator in conjunction with : which works, but this is severely overthinking the problem. Let's just swap indices:
Oh I'm all for small tests ;) But here we need data in the queue to flush it, and data to be present to take() it. So they kind of need to be done in sequence.
Done, although this filter is specialized for 3D only.
Good question. I noticed method entry breakpoints slow things down considerably when I'm debugging Java programs with Eclipse. I hope someone has the answer!
How on earth is it buggy?
talks about consuming WCF services in Silverlight, but claims: There will be no proxies, no generated code, no 3rd party utilities, and no disgusting "Add Service Reference" usage. What is so wrong with me adding a service reference in my Silverlight project? Are there hidden overheads? Or is it a case of Fear Of Auto Magic on the part of the author?
wow, awesome! never knew this. Thanks again!
I realise this is probably an absolutely horrible way to do a query, and of course its not working. The point of it is to select users based on a date range and a keyword.
* oh so very sad * :(
I got it.. this is incredibly silly question! Static means I just access it directly from Without using it from the instance.
Excellent question. Running a large project in successive version of Python wouldn't be very definitive, unless you had, say, unit tests that magically achieved 100% code coverage, so a tool like this would be nice to have.
I found an excellent tutorial on how to create site columns and content types - here : (THANKS AGAIN ROB!) Does anyone know of a written or video tutorial that will explain how to create a list and list instance in MOSS 2007. I use WSP Builder, and the build in templates from Microsoft aren't compatible (or up to the task). Preferably a method that focuses on the CAML (xml) , and explains in detail the theory, and demonstrates how it is done. Thank you.
First: I like your approach of being concentrated on a clean and proper state handling of your application.Excellent! But, as you said: Android can kill activities and manage their lifecycle for itself. The OS may release memory allocated for your activity as soon as possible requiring you to allocate it again. This means your fragment may or may not get destroyed. As you can see in your stack trace, FragmentActivity.onCreate is called.This obviously inddicates your existing resources created within the context of the old activity are not access - able anymore. The only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context. For all other resources you should be aware and handle properly that created resources may be invalid at the time you are trying to access them.
Then shared_pointer is probably the way to go (if you're happy with the cost of refcounting them).
All the msgs above have significance that they are trying to modify PGFID. Create one message id say 'P_MSG_PGFID_OP' and log errors there.
Is there an easy way to find parse errors in javascript code? Last week I was debugging a javascript problem where the first javascript function that was called gave an 'object expected' error. I later determined that this was because the browser wasn't able to parse my javascript code. I eventually solved the problem but it was a painful process that involved pouring over my code line by line, trying to find my mistake. There must be an easier way.
Faststrings is leaps and bounds faster than the normal Delphi StringReplace function. I really hope Peter releases a new version for Delphi 2009.
No it doesn't "explode", I am not changing a sebool, I am changing the file context. Yes a restorecon would un-do the change. We'll need to file a request for that but for now this is good enough.
I'm reading about the CallContext class (). The documentation says something about "logical threads" and "Thread Local Storage". What's a logical thread, I didn't know that there existed multiple kinds of threads? What's a Thread Local Storage, is it a class or a principle of some kind? I have not been able to find it in on MSDN, but I'm sure it is there some place, so any links would be great :-)
The above 7 lines repeats a bit, and could go and be a function.
Have you tried logging into Linux as your installed Oracle user then When you log in you'll be able to change your password. Good luck :)
This worked for me.
The variable you should probably use here is U_BOOT_FDT_USE, defined in make.conf. I agree the name is not great - we can change it if you like. But the intention is that this variable tells you which fdt to use, so there should be no need for this sort of logic in ebuilds.
This should probably be ignore. It is not part of the explicit ITK style specification.
I don't believe that typename is needed here since there is a template present.
cbk->mask will only contain bricks where the request has been sent. A read will never have a bit corresponding to a brick being healed on cbk->mask set, so the & is not needed. However, for writes (that also send the requests to bricks being healed), doing the & will cause that bricks that were unhealthy at the start of the operation will be marked again as bad after completing the operation, even if the operation succeeded. I think this is not correct.
ah - my bad.
Working with ANEs is an incredibly frustrating process.
I really like what I am seeing so far.
I've looked at what can be done within the NSIS framework we use to build the Windows installer.
That irritated the hell out of me too but I didn't realise it was configurable in the .launch file.
Bad memory.
Those variables are used by everyone deriving from GerritCommand. It should be pushed up as well and the getter/setters
I mainly tried declaring all variables in the local-most scope.
Ok cool this is just a matter of adding strings to the various [NotFound()|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L160] returns in files.cpp There are a number of error cases in the [browse|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] and [read|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] endpoints I'd imagine one could change the javascript to generate bad requests which should be sufficient to test this :)
I don`t think that this could really happened. Because ptlrpc has single thread for rq_set, that means only one ptlrpc_check_set() could happened for a request. And ptl_send_rpc could not race with after_reply.
I don't think so. I am not familiar with where they make a difference, but it looks like an intentional special Mac case (See MacMessages and canShowMacSheetPanel). I suspect this works fine after the general UI is up and running - and that the problem here is a side effect of being the first frame.
I am very jealous of your name!
IMHO the probe*XML functions should simply take xmlTextReaderPtr. shared_ptr is only used to manage the lifetime of the reader, so it is impl. detail. I would even remove the typedef.
Each tab in my xcode project can have navigation/debug/utility menus open. If I close those menus on one tab, then switch to the next, they may be open. This is really frustrating! If I want the menus closed, I want them closed on all tabs. How can I change this behavior?
I generally prefer not to be credited in source files.
GetDate() does not return a date serial number, it returns a "formatted" number with YYYYMMDD, see include/tools/date.hxx how nDate is stored in init(), which is returned by GetDate().
I know I can configure command line arguments in the Run configuration but I want to run a java file multiple times with different command line arguments. It's a pain to change the Run Configuration every time. Is there a way I can make Eclipse prompt me for command line arguments every time I run the program?
We eventually dropped using Filestream. I believe we never could get it to work right with Nhibernate. Good luck!
Tested/cross-browser: If there is no submit button, the form will degrade miserably if javascript is not available!
You should really check out this plugin: I have been using it for about 10 sites and it's really great! Since the latest update it's posible to export your custom fields to a PHP file which you can include your functions.php

is hugely useful :) I'm sure it could be improved a bit further with computing the name of the directory once and re-using it, but this is nicer-enough that I'm fine stopping here. :)
Very useful, Thanks You!
For someone who uses the Ctrl-W bindings in vim habitually, it is incredibly annoying to have Chrome OS ask me, "Wanna close this window, then?" How do I remap keys in Chrome OS? Can't find this top secret setting anywhere.
Here we can assume that because the if statement above checks to see what extensions are enabled. If the config option has a single entry in the list, 'all', that means all extensions are supposed to be enabled on nova. I just chose Hosts here because I wanted an extension that problem wasn't ever going to be removed. (also one that wasn't many characters)
[~shazron]Sorry that was weird.
@PhilipOakley excellent suggestion! I hadn't used `cherry-pick` before but that worked quite well. If you post as an answer I'll accept.
Sorry about that.
Sweet :) Happy hacking!
i found some class that a very great men develop!!! that solove this: here is a link to download it it the last post on the page: direct link:
Put all of this into a static helper method that returns a Map<String,String> already configured for the Sun JNDI names used below. Then we only need a map for connection pooling as an instance member.
So this could be hard to explain but i want to do a for ... := 1 to 10 do statement but i want it to be for A to N do. The main purpose of this excersise is to load data into a string grid. So lets have it load the cells 0,1 0,2 0,3 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 with the Letter A, B, C, D, E all the way up to 14. If anyone knows how to do this i would be extremely thankful!
I've done some easy .hover(function() statement in jQuery. When i hover over a text i simply want a #div.fadeIn, and on non-hover fadeOut. It works. But it's just if i spam the text-trigger with hover and un-hoverring really quickly and then stop the animation begin to give a blinking effect. It just kind of loops, really annoying!
Not sure about this method. It seems to make sense to me the way Dan explained it but I'm not comfortable giving this change a +2 since I didn't write any of the original code and may not be aware of all of the issues.
my experience with SOAP is not good ): and documentation(at least in D2010) is extremely poor!
Hehe this is nothing compared to some other little adventures I had with them ^_^" ... I love them *^o^*!!

Now when I load it to the device, an image won't show up. This is all kinds of horrible!

Super I'll commit shortly -- thanks Yonik!
This is the third post I've seen with people filtering by *ascii* char-code - it's a terrible idea! Where are you getting these examples from?
how about use default wikitext namespace (see getDefaultWikitextNS below) or allow specifying namespace as an argument?
I have noticed this come and go. After runnings specs in RubyMotion (which is incredibly great by the way) this annotations appear even when running specs from the console. Then they go away. I have no idea why.
Very direct question, i need to know if its possible and maybe where to start reading about that. Im a programmer with zero experience in windows servers and a client is asking if we can deliver in their windows boxes(and no they wont let us use any kind of virtualization in them). Thanks guys, i know its not 100% programming related but... hope you can help =) EDIT: Wow, fast reply! Thanks guys!!!
why are you going to manager function if glusterd_svc_check_volfile_identical function will failed ??? you should simply return error.
Very painful and doesn't work with inputs from the user.
nit: this import is not needed anymore and can be removed
$('li:nth-child(3), li:nth-child(4)').insertAfter('ul').wrapAll('')You can't "break a list". You can either A) remove it and replace it with two lists B) extract some elements to make another list with. The following is terrible terrible practice, but then again so is what you're asking...
These two variables were defined separately in the previous version. Now that you need them in every method, you could just declare them at the first utilization (applies to the other methods too).
I know techsmith has a screen recorder api called that you can access programatically. I haven't used it, but I've used the snagit api by the same company and it's excellent.
Hi Bob, I think the setting of screen resolution is not important as it makes no different when I changed it to smaller or larger size therefore I chose the medium size (1024x768). It's hard to figure out what date of rendering the map and it does not really affect to the embed code I will remove it from the code.
Enlightenment DR16 is packaged with openSUSE 11.1 but it's a bit painful to use with KDE apps as there's no obvious (on the Enlightenment site, google etc.) way to provide a systray for KDE apps that require one (e.g., ktorrent). Anyone know of a way around this? I'm not using e for the eye-candy - I'm running on a 2.6GHz Celeron and KDE (4.1) performance isn't exactly stellar so I'm trying out a few alternatives.
The above code from 2008101602 is present in the 1.1.0RC2_RELEASE so therefore existed before the 1.1.0_RELEASE so needs to be removed.
Ran into this myself. Very annoying limitation IMO.
Putting data in the ID is a terrible, terrible idea.
Ah sorry I misunderstood you.
I have 2 files I need to merge based on 2 columns. I have tried using awk as well as tried combining the 2 columns using _ and then using the join command. When using join, some records were not matched, even after sorting, and multiple records were created. Using awk I can match the files correctly, but cannot get the output to print with zeroes when no match exists. File 1: File 2: Desired output: Any help would be hugely appreciated, I am new to large data files and unix!
i assume that the reason that the copyright is updated now is because the file was updated in 2011, but the copyright wasn't.
This seems fairly trivial but is giving me hella grief! I have a module in the lib folder. The controller. config/Application.rb And I get this error I know the module is loaded correctly. What am I doing wrong?

Unfortunately, no. That's my major pain when merging vcproj file changes.
I am working on a test application based on ASP.NET MVC. I am new to CSS stuff so I am learning that as well. I have created a master page called "new.master" and created a new css "new.css". I am calling the view from controller as: What I am doing is that I am frequently updating the css and master page. So I run the application in debug mode frequently. After sometime I stop seeing the effect of changes in css. When I "view source" in chrome and check the css, it shows an old version. When I change the name of both master page and css, I start to receive updated views but that works for sometime and then again I stop getting the CSS updates. Have you faced this problem? How can I fix it? (Its terribly annoying!)
yes, I have just installed binutils and it's looking very awesome!!! I'm going to check it out! bb with more info
Why did you add this back? It's not needed as far as I know.
what I want to know is, what does create? what can I do with it? what does it mean? Every tutorial without fail will avoid talking about the first version entirely The reason the tutorial doesn't rell you what to do with it is that it really is totally useless! It allocates a single and gives you a pointer to that. The problem is that if you want an int, why don't you just declare one?
There is no TCP multicast, I'd vote this down, but I don't have enough reputation.
So i HATE XCode!!!!!
I really appreciate your comments and I really enjoy our discussions:)
mdrun -nstlist > 0 is not affected by this change, it will still change nstlist. Or do you mean to add a note even with nstlist=0? nstlist=0 is explained as guess and 1 with 1 seems ok to me.
Note that this doesn't use a StringBuilder, so will have horrible performance for very long sequences.
I am trying to override Control-Meta-Down Arrow and Control-Meta-Up Arrow in emacs. I've tried all sorts of combinations of: and: etc... but it always says: . This means it is only taking into account the . Why is it ignoring the Control?? I've been working on this for 3 hours and emacs online documentation with regards to key bindings is surprisingly absolutely terrible.
this is gorgeous!
What status is the best here? I cannot use status from the current response here, also I don't know status of the other responses here.
There may be a minor bug here in that there can be a TMPFAIL at authentication time. This doesn't seem to handle that.
PatchTable$MyTable.onClick(ClickEvent) line: 299 will also call movePointerTo(cell.getRowIndex()); sorry I try every corner and cannot find the difference after adding this line.
8 hours? That's pretty quick! My last InnoSetup installation coding took TEN DAYS, and it still won't work right on Vista. It installed an app library, some sample apps, created a database, installed and started 2 windows services, and published a web site, but 10 days is still far too long...
I really liked your approach to it! I found that changing the code to the following made my progressbar update correctly. I had some issues while using math.round().
Excellent! Thanks very much. Don't understand why I did not try to find it myself. Thanks again.
can you move on top of the file (like other dissector file)
@massive I've replied to your question about dealing with concurrency issues in bulk updates by editing my answer. Hope this helps!
Excellent question!
It was only referenced from the description text in rest-api-accounts.txt which is deleted by this change. Since the JSON entities of the REST endpoints are described directly in the REST API documentation I've moved the description of the QueryLimit over to rest-api-accounts.txt.
Sorry guys... :( I was the reason for this trouble.
Sorry about that.
Thanks for the link. That's pretty cool!
We can go back and change this to the char* version if it gets too difficult to figure out what's going on.
Finally closing this bug from hell.
Best regards Andrew
Have you tried the and methods? There is a that mentions the approach. Also, in JDBC 4.0 Sun added the that allows you to get a unique handle on a row. The feature is supported by Oracle and DB2. For sql server you will probably need a third party driver such as . Good luck!
Sorry, this is still unacceptable. ImplEESdrWriter::ImplWriteShape() is used by both the binary export and the OOXML filter, you need to set the OOXML flag in the OOXML filter. Jut put a breakpoint on this line in the debugger, see its backtrace, and set the flag in the first method that is already OOXML-specific, and pass the bool around till this line.
Consider using expert_add_info and use the proto_item* returned from proto_tree_add_item(ath_tree, hf_ath_hlen, ...) so that the hlen field that is bad is highlighted)
I absolutely despise working with PDF documents. But when I absolutely have to, I have been using . It has quite a bit of functionality, , and it is theoretically free. Though to use it effectively it helps if you get the book that they push on their website. I'm not certain if you can easily make thumbnails with it, but it has worked for me in generating and manipulating PDFs on every project I've worked on so far.
I think the question is valid. I agree with the other responses, but it doesn't mean it's a terrible question. I've only ever had to use a Safari CSS hack once as a temporary solution and later got rid of it. I agree that you shouldn't have to target just Safari, but no harm in knowing how to do it. FYI, this hack only targets Safari 3, and also targets Opera 9.
That just doesn't seem right, ones created by a call to generate_key are trivially generated and not imported. If we're at the point where this code is lying to you then the app can't trust the ORIGIN tag regardless.
Would one be violating the the terms of agreement with Google App Engine if one were to use Amazon's S3 service with Google App Engine? I do know there is restrictions on what you can and can't do but I was not sure of this. Having these two combined features, one could provide one heck of a system at a relatively low cost compared to hosting this with a hosting company. Has anyone done this already or have heard of an application that combines the two technologies?
...except for the fact that get_initial_timestamp() doesn't exist for Fam10h, and implementation looks non-trivial.
We need refresh freq_demote = defrag->tier_demote_frequency; here, otherwise we won't be able to change the frequency from the CLI.
I'm an idiot... there's nothing wrong with the readme.txt.
Excellent question. Running a large project in successive version of Python wouldn't be very definitive, unless you had, say, unit tests that magically achieved 100% code coverage, so a tool like this would be nice to have.
I am trying to generate API documentation via cabal and haddock. I want it to be latex. So I do: This fails ultimately with: Is there something I can do or is something wrong with haddock? FYI, I have to use cabal since the build process is rather complicated (lots of preprocessors, ffi libraries, ...). Invoking haddock manually is really painful. Building HTML documentation however is working completely as expected. The complete output is at . I am using:
I abbreviated the heck out of my arguments and thinking but damn it thats what I think :)

Yeah, it's definitely annoying!
This code is scary :(
Currently the msbuild logs for team build are appalling as they are just plain text and are very difficult to read. Also the ones created by my build are approx 30Mb and take quite a while to download (our TFS server is in our datacentre). Does anyone know any way of being able to view these logs easier, prefereably integrated with either TFS itself or TFS WebAccess?

I have a few months of experience with Ruby on Rails and really loved it from the beginning on. Now, for work, I was asked to code in Grails and although I first had some objections, I now think it's a very decent framework. One thing that really impressed me in Grails are Taglibs because they make frontend modularity so much easier. I would really like to do something with Rails. Is there anything like Taglibs for Rails? If not, what are the best practices for accomplishing this kind of view modularity (and, in essence, making my life easier)?
FEAR!!!!!!!!!!!
I really love anonymous inner classes...
Since this patch is so damn large already I won't be making anymore changes to this other than critical/blocker bug fixes.
@Chris Two different control statements just to appease developers who want their switch statements to work in a slightly different way? That's a **terrible** idea. VB [had that mentality for loops](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Visual_Basic/Loops), and it
Now that I'm really looking at the code, would not the right fix be to change toknext to be signed instead of unsigned (so that the for loop stops immediately), or to check that it is > 0? if tokens = NULL, then parser->toknext will always be set to 0. That said, your change is somehow equivalent so we could keep it as-is.
Awesome, thanks!
I'm not sure if I understand why it should not pick ":/extras/custom3/test" as first.
Patch Set 5: Fails This already failed the unit tests once. Please do not submit any CLs until the unit tests are fixed.
put your path and your shadow in a set. apply your animation to the set and it'll affect both. a really terrible example where I move both at once.
Can we write a test for this? It seems to be an important semantic aspect of the interface, worth recording.
Thanks a lot for your review. What do you think about "in the adapted class"? Anyway, I'm going to bother some of the guru to hear what they think about it...
If you're running on Windows, you could do something similar using PowerShell. This could be extended pretty easily to find all unversioned and ignored files and delete them. Hope that's helpful to someone!
In which case, shouldn't the code just say that all other open projects should already have their SDK's pointing to the SDK used by the IDE? i.e., now that we do this, we shouldn't have to modify other projects, only this project since all others should already be in sync. The fishy part here is just that choosing something in a project import dialog affects other projects which doesn't make sense. If you want that experience, then the dialog should be more of a global IDE preference.
Well either you query the database every damn time and your plugin/tool/code will be super slow.
I am relatively new to AngularJS and am loving every moment of it! I have an unordered list of products. When the user hovers over them, I need the list element to have an class set on them. I am currently doing it this way: And my showDetails is as follows: Now, everything is working just fine, however, I was wondering if it was possible to set the class without the ng-repeat and having no variable to bind to? How should I write my showDetails function to set the class this time? My first try is: But what do I do in the ng-class attribute?
Wow! Awesome responses - I'll have to try'em out after work today, and I'll let y'all know how it goes :)
Copied from sys_openbsd_386s.s and missed - fixed :)
The (NLTK) is an excellent resource if you're considering Python as a language. It incorporates lots of the stuff you'd expect in a text processing/NLP environment like parsers, stemmers and part-of-speech tagging. Documentation on it is pretty good too. As for datasets, NLTK comes with a variety of for experimenting with. Hope it helps, B.
Rebol (600 Ko only) is based on antigrain geometry library which is Opensource It seems really great, can OpenGL do better ?
No worries! I've done the same thing many times on SO.
should another patchset be pushed, please change the leading blanks to tabs
I keep finding myself wanting to click on the link that says "Click image to edit". Can we make that part of the link?
Ew, that sounds a bit ugly! Is it possible for an instance of a class to be created before its unit's initialization section has run? In other words could an instance of TMyObject try to use FLogger before it's been set in the initialization section?
This makes me really sad.
So, it is as simple as purchasing a domain name, and then adding that identifying information to the hosts file? If so, that is excellent!!
Lambdas automatically 'suck' in local variables, I'm afraid that's simply how they work by definition.
I'll remove it here, but so you know - there's a problem - if someone sets it to null (for example from REST), it fails with NPE in StorageComandBase. but that can be fixed in a different patch.

Oops! Yeah, that was just radio functionality heh. It turns out this isn't as straightforward as I thought. Give me a few minutes and I think I can fix it.
yes, that's the point: if it's a *designer* plugin, it needs to depend on designer, as in the other example. but this is a ui loader/widget plugin only.
Compare these two methods: Aside from the method signatures (bar can declare instead of ), is there any practical difference between the two methods? To be clear: I'm aware that this is a horrible approach to exception handling, and should not be done!
I hate to say it, but constant polling over HTTP is the poor mans solution.

Your best bet is probably TcpClient. There's a great sample that does exactly what you're doing right in the .NET Documentation here: Good luck to you!
I really hate when this happens.. I search and search for an answer and then I post a question. Then minutes later I find the answer.. The answer was on line 5.. this let me make the call.. I mean I get a pile of junk on the screen, but it doesn't fail... no exception.
@MarcinJuraszek: that's an excellent idea, thanks! just implemented it, however should I create an index for the 'rand' column? If I do, data infile takes ages to load the file. If I don't, I get no results when I add: `ORDER BY sb.rand ASC`. Any thoughts
No worries Stephen!
Doh.
when i was suggesting flipping the boolean, i did also wonder whether we wouldn't be better off just passing in the length. if it's <= 0, interpret that as "don't know"? that would then move 8192 down out of the callers too. or... i really like the way you went for readFully rather than implementing the missing read()s, which is what i'd actually imagined. how about we go one further and just have a static fromFile or similar? then it could do the stat, and have everything it needs. you could even use Libcore.os open/fstat/read/close to avoid the RandomAccessFile without increasing the overall amount of code.

This code is broken. $this->storage needs to be changed
How about that one? Is it because you won't be able to automatically change call sites?
Great! It's been good to be able to contribute and I hope to be able to more for this awesome project when I have the spare time.

I have a serious problem which I can't a solution to. I need to authenticate a token in order to let the user login into my app, the problem is that even though I'm using the AsyncTask, and probably because of it, I can't authenticate it in time.

I don't need a login as there will only be a small number of users and I will use their windows username for identification. Has anyone done anything similiar? What else do I need to add? It doesn't need to be all singing and dancing as it is just for use within a small development team. Any ideas would be great! Thanks

This seems a bit error prone and hacky to me. What if $contentContext->getInaccessibleContentShown() was TRUE before. It would be FALSE afterwards (probably not relevant here, but maybe elsewhere). What about a second argument in "getNode()" that allows to even fetch hidden/protected nodes?

Try <% if(ViewContext.ViewName == "Index"){%> Should work fine !!! EDIT : REMOVED IN BETA1 Removed the ViewName property from the ViewContext class.
It would be helpful if the returned structure were described more fully, just for clarity.

I think it's time to just close this issue.
I'm working on a huge application and the extra steps you mentioned were really pain in the ass for me. So I developed a small proxy class that handles class method bindings. First I've added a small proxy class Then added a category accessor to NSApplication (I actually added this to my application delegate and implemented ) Now you are ready to bind class methods to the Application object, even in the interface builder, with the keyPath .
The ebook summarises Thread.Suspend and Thread.Resume thusly: The deprecated Suspend and Resume methods have two modes â dangerous and useless! The book recommends using a synchronization construct such as an or to perform thread suspending and resuming.

If I plan to use data caching do I have to worry about conflicts when also using deferred loading? It seems that with linq i am losing control of my data.
The CherryPick RESTApi acts on revisions (e.g. patchsets), not Changes. Just like the review RestApi does. Hence I don't think that it should go into ChangeApi. Look at the REST-url, and you will see it differs quite from the other RESTFul commands in ChangeApi. If you still want me to add it to ChangeApi, I can do that. But this is how I reasoned about where to put it.
I just have to say this is a brilliant idea, love it! +1
Wow, would have expected a quick answer on this! Well, found my own answer: you can't have more than one exception with except. See the here. Instead, they recommend creating a Filter. .

I'm rethinking the design of my GUI. I designed a few JFrame with Netbeans automated GUI (yes, I'm lazy, and this generated code is often awful, I know !), but now I want them to be JPanel (actually, to inherit from another class that inherits JPanel). But I had the "setDefaultCloseOperation" modified, so my code is broken : setDefaultCloseOperation is impossible for a JPanel. Since I can't modify the generated code, I was wondering : is there a way to make Netbeans understand I changed my mind, and regenerate the code ?
Thanks Jeff!
Maybe this comment: // The old CSS resource has no support for many at-rules, like animations. There is no way for us to parse them using the old CSS parser, so we will just output them as a string to the GSS stylesheet and hope that the GSS parser is okay with the rule

I had the problem that white was the "Overscroll" color, not actually the fading edge. try this (assuming you want a fading edge, but not the horrid white glare when you hit the ends! (otherwise set requires fading edge to none)):
+1 Saves a lot of time when unit testing Data Access layers. Just note that TS will often need MSDTC which might not be desirable (depending on whether your app will need MSDTC)
They could probably be combined, but the speed would be the same. We still need to write the address out first before we can auto-increment. Let's leave that to later when/if it gets moved to the southbridge wrapper
That code is absolutely horrendous.
BTW: This is one reason why I hate this autoboxing shit since Java 5. I would love to have a way to prevent it in code (forbidden checks should detect this somehow).

You made an excellent point in a comment below, @RailsSon: you want to print Â£s to display a specific currency, but employ that display using a Japanese expression for financial numbers. I find it strange that your request hasn't been implemented in the language by decoupling the `locale` module's use of currency value and that currency's display properties.
Great descriptions of all the answers !
Could you add another test which uses line breaks after "${" and before "}"?
Thanks Laura.
This is probably silly but very frustrating. Using VS2008 with a C++ project, when I'm working normally, the breakpoints window is visible and active but when I'm debugging it disappears and can't be shown. This is a problem if I want to edit the condition of a breakpoint while running. Pressing the breakpoints window button doesn't do anything and neither does pressing Ctrl+Alt+B Does this happen to anybody else? It's a brand new install with Visual Assist and QT integration as extensions. same configuration with VS2005 doesn't have any problems.
you'll need someone with some maven experience to review this
We are working in real estate project, there we have image and video uploads in many places. We are started with in few places, But now we found an issue that it does not work if the flash player not installed in the browser. Its working only after installed the flash player in browser. This is really worrying. We should not force user to install flash player to upload images/video. How to handle this issue?
Doc string needs to be changed. This does not return anything. it can be something like- This function verify detail of referenced datastore.
This condition is always true. I assume the condition you meant was n != ptrSize. Though I see you removed this condition altogether in CL 9704 (rebase failure?).
Could we have a single definition of such constants? :-) Perhaps some org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.StringConstants class?
That works! Very awesome :) How do I select your answer as the solution?
Entering an invalid object size limit results in displaying an 'Internal Server Error'. If possible it should display a proper error message, saying that the limit is invalid.

Is it possible to re-open an .xcarchive file on Xcode? I know this is not common, but I would like to open a project exactly as it was submitted to the App Store. I don't have back up of that exact build, so it would be really great to open the archive copy! Before you ask why don't I just download it from the store, I must say this build has been approved and is just pending on my release. :) Thanks!
not if you want to compare from a raw byte array used to serialize object IDs
Wow, great ! Thanks a lot !

There is reference information available on the MSDN website. If you want more of an introduction or tutorial, then Charles Petzold's book is excellent.
Great question! :)
The problem is that "Hello World" is a terrible example to use with TDD. You really need something that generates variable output based on variable input.
After looking at the answers below, I am very sad that this is an example of backwards progress for SSRS.

I'm writing a kernel (2.6.28) module that uses a dynamic timer. I'm using the timer_list structure as follows: This works ok for about 2 seconds until the timer expires. Then the system crashes. I've also tried something like this with the same result: Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Excellent! Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks.
If you're debugging at the instruction level rather than the source level, it's an awful lot for you easier to map unoptimized instructions back to the source. Also, compilers are occasionally buggy in their optimizers. In the Windows division at Microsoft, all release binaries are built with debugging symbols and full optimizations. The symbols are stored in separate PDB files and do not affect the performance of the code. They don't ship with the product, but most of them are available at the .
There's 2 parts to this question, both about RestKit: How can we post up 2 values email and password, and deal with the response using the object mapper How can we map 2 objects in a response We are expecting the following JSON response: What's the correct way to map this out, we've got a class setup for User and Token, but all the examples i've seen seem to not show something like this where there is two segments to the response, here's the code we have at the moment: Appreciate any help you can give on this, loving RestKit so far!
This sucks.
In my MySQL table, there is a row labeled "state". There are 3 values possible for this. How could I utilise PHP to echo "Unbanned" as apposed to "0" in state? And "Banned" as apposed to "1" and "Temp-Banned" as apposed to "3"? How would I use php to display "UnBanned" instead of 0 in the MySQL? I am using a table for this. All help is incredibly appreciated :)
how are we guaranteeing that when we invoke this clean up there are no threads consuming these RPCs?
That's very sad and the issue was opened a year ago...
@HansPassant - Excellent! Everything is falling into place now. If you post as an answer, I will happily accept it.

@Aggieboy that's really sad, and I have to hand-code stuff .
Right, I've got this horrible mess of html and erb (that does work!), but I want to do things properly and render the whole thing with the method. But I'm not sure how to do this, I can only render text with the link_to at the moment.
Sorry if this spam's things however it's unlikely that I'll work on these.
This is simple I hope :) When I create a new web application in WSS does it need to be on port 80 if I want to point an external domain name at it? Everything is standard in terms of IIS and ports that are open i.e. port 80 is the only one open. I am guessing if I let WSS assign a port number to the new web application surely this can never be accessed externally unless I open the assigned port? Cheers
I've used the ExprTk library in the past, it's easy to use and fast in evaluation. http://www.partow.net/programming/exprtk/index.html
Hi Daniel thanks in advance for your support.
Pull it back in if you think different.
not if you want to compare from a raw byte array used to serialize object IDs
Thank you Jing.
I'm a novice programmer who is attempting assembly for the first time. Sorry in advance if this is an incredibly lame question. I have a character stored in the EAX register, but I need to move it to my DL register. When I try: mov dl, eax I get an error C2443: operand size conflict. I know that the eax register is 32 bit while the dl is 8 bit... am I on to something?? How do I go about solving this.
Excellent hint! I was using scrollTo(0,0) and it was doing nothing
I have an Android app that looks absolutely horrible if the user sets their font size to large or extra large (via Settings -> Display -> Font size in Ice Cream Sandwich). It just plain wasn't designed for variable font sizes, and it makes a lot of the text unreadable. I've seen applications that preserve the font size for most views, so I know that there has to be a way to do this. Is there a simple way for me to tell the application to ignore the user's font size preference? And if there isn't, how would you suggest that I go about calculating the font sizes? If nothing else, is there a way for me to retrieve the user's font size preference?
this is a disgustingly horrible hack, but it might get the job done:
excellent, thanks much!
To address the previous concerns about constructing a massive QByteArray in the case of no terminating character: I set pos2 to pos so that the QByteArray is empty in that case.
+1 for IntelliJ. Worth every penny.
action == 0 is Press and action==1 is SetFocus Do you plan to move this to QAccessibleWidget?? I guess that makes sense
I cannot recommend higher than you reading through the postings of Bart De Smet (), he is really brilliant when it comes to Lambda. His recent series covered dynamic Lambda, starting with Absolutely beautiful code.
Is this valid ? what I'm really worried about is can you specify type and also use def at the same time?
*sorry*
Sorry I guess I'm against "never computing this shit"... because you guys think returning NaN is ok.
Please note that according to http://www.w3schools.com, the values "table", "table-row", and "table-cell" are not supported in IE7 and earlier. IE8 requires a !DOCTYPE. http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp
Sorry typo: "our part" in place of "one part" above.
Sorry should ask first.
This means the folder structure is not as expected? I guess we had always as follows: /pywikibot /pywikibot/comms /pywikibot/... <others> /scripts /scripts/i18n /scripts/maintenance /tests /tests/data /tests/i18n
That's impossible to say until somebody invests the time and effort to try lots of different function approximations on that architecture to see if they can come up with something better. For now it is the fastest approach.
No. Just size permgen appropriately. It's no different to having to size the heap appropriately. Don't be afraid!
Same question on side-effects as on the previous file
:( So we need to either port this file over to kernel style or not use goto's. Since we started it before everyone decided kernel style was OK, we've been using a hacked-down google c++ style which forbids goto :/
Wow! 3 lines of code instead of a page... I wish I could vote +5.
Actually it seems to be line 21 that is indented wrong. The newly added lines are correctly indented inside the <ui:style> tag.
Yes, you need two view controllers. Check out lesson 7 from Stanfords CS193P iPhone Application Programming course. It is available online. Both slides and the lecture through iTunes U. I really enjoyed watching the course!
I think the bytes.Buffer version was more readable.
The 0x1A byte is a terrible, painful [source of agony](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12483711/serialdata-eof-circumstances).
OK, will change it - there was a debate about whether we should also check for 'false', 'False' etc., which is why it was a list. I left it like that in case we changed our minds! Provided we don't, I'll just make it a simple equality check!
can do it ! And you can find other plugins on the . Note that you cannot use this plugin with github pages. This video is excellent !
Brain fart.
Excellent hint! I was using scrollTo(0,0) and it was doing nothing
Cosmetic: According to last changes related to tvb_captured_length and tvb_reported_length it is good point to start thinking about "reported" case (btsnoop format provide both frame length). In "reported" case we can have only part of frame: for example first 2 bytes. This dissector will fail at this line, so nothing will be dissected, but if you move lines 131-140,(169)171-181 directly before place when it will be use then we can dissect some fields. "context" can be filled somewhere about line current 202, "rf_channel" can be put between lines 144-145, "aa_offenses" can be fetch after 170 or where "context" is filled, the problem is "flags", but after moved it after line 147 you are able to decode "btle_rf_channel" field etc.
Oh, wow, awesome! Thanks! (this question needs to have a answer, any volunteer?)

In my android app i'm trying to share an Open Graph including an object and an action. In my facebook app i added a story: and (is this ok?). When i try to add an image to the object in the OG i get above error. This is my code: here's the logcat: What am i doing wrong? Maybe i'm messing up some strings in the story, facebook tutorial is awful!

Looks pretty cool. Fresh and minimalist. Love it :-) Good work.
Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this I agree with the first reviewer, turning the condition around will make it better readable. Besides that, great idea and solution!
I think should this be translated(m_xOffset, m_yOffset) instead, because adjusted(x1,y1,x2,y2) will make the rectangle grow
Can we get this from CPUID instead of hard coding it?

OK this is really odd. I have a list of about 20 pairs of TV's that look like: etc, all the way up to 20 They all work fine but one. It although the names and order of the TVs are correct in both the template and the resource its displays in the location. I have tried clearing both ModX's cache and my browser cache but here is the result I get: The Template: The Resource's TV's: The result on the browser: If anyone can give me a hint as to what's going on I would be really greatful! Thanks
I have added the modulo because if int is actually 64 bits then the snprintf would mangle the string for values >= 2^32. OTOH it is quite unlikely that we ever see such high numbers(?), but you are right it is not really a good solution. I'll push a version that will work with 64 bits ints and the refined error message. Thanks a lot for taking the time to write the review!
exactly why i'm asking because thats what i fear!
I am running VS 2012. Working on a project that is stored on a mapped network drive. Whenever I go to close the solution it takes several minutes (5-7) for Visual Studio to close. It does eventually close, but very painful waiting for it to finish. Anyone have any suggestions on how to fix?
That's really sad...
I think this can be refactored (with the RTU "duplication") into the Modbus dissector.
great thanks Joel.

Im maintaining a site where I need to 'click' a link with javascript. The href is inline javascript, not a url so I cant just navigate to that url instead. Im expect this is bad practice (the rest of the site is terrible!) but I need to make the link 'clicked' with javascript. Im using jQuery. I know this question has been asked before but it seems normally people are trying to follow the link, which I am not.

Agreed. Excellent question.
It's a nice feature; does it cause a particular problem?
Since the array is actually only used in one case, I'm not sure that makes sense. Added a comment instead.

I am in need of generating a random string with spaces and mixedCase. is all I got so far: I am getting only uppercase strings with no spaces - I believe the tweak should be pretty striaghtforward to get mixed case and spaces in the soup. Any help greatly appreciated!
what about this case? if user selected sysprep/cloud init in run once (then we get here) but also have payload configured?
There is a way to fix everything, but you will still hate the autotools until the end of time!
If we agree to always treat a single number as JSON even if the client doesn't enable datatype support, then we can always set its datatype to JSON regardless of that.
@Marc-AndrÃ© Lafortune Your answer there was incredibly helpful! Thank you!

I just came across the following answer on another question: Hope that helps!
I could put the finalizeForCommandLine after processExceptionAtExit. Then it doesn't change anything for LIB_MPI and that wouldn't work anyhow as you point out.
Put all of this into a static helper method that returns a Map<String,String> already configured for the Sun JNDI names used below. Then we only need a map for connection pooling as an instance member.
No. The exception is needed so it is rethrown if the user decides to cancel. User can only see exception stack trace in the log.
I have a screen with say 20 controls on it. I want to show all twenty, then hide only the ones that don't relate to what I'm working on. My problem is that between the loops the screen paints. It looks very ugly. I know I've seen this done but for the life of me I can't find that code, or even remember what app I'd seen that code in.. Does anyone know how to suspend the paint for a bit?
thatÂ´s really sad :(
You are going to kill me when I say this but it seems like we should just commit your first patch.
Wow, great many thanks! File was Data!
No prob. Good luck!
The biggest problem is that we've had too many committers over the years and we'd have to get all of their permission to change it.
Not sure if this is by design, but for now, from within Python causes a javascript exception to be raised and displayed (along with line and column numbers). Great success!

this is a problem that regularly arises when I write Silverlight XAML. In this case, I've made a usercontrol VerticalTabStop (code attached) that has a ToolTip attached. I instanciate a couple of my usercontrols, and then I get the debugging window and the following error: I get an awful lot of these messages as I hover my mouse over the buttons. Any suggestions to what I'm doing wrong here? Cheers
Sorry should ask first.
Thanks! Both you and Jim were very helpful!
excellent! it works. but could you please explain how this works? Does javascript take time to load? could a thread.sleep step done the same thing?
It's only available privately to hardware vendors from Microsoft. I think this is extremely unfortunate (I have argued to Microsoft that it would be a powerful tool for academic research, as in my uses, among other things). I was fortunate to have access at the time while consulting for Intel and NVIDIA.
I was mentioning the blank line. Please don't remove tk.WithExtra.
We also need to check the return value from wal_commit as well.
Sorry for the noise.
I guess the big question is whether it is sufficient to test the functionality by mocking out getaddrinfo() or if we need to actually make the call. If the former, I think it could go in UT. Lets see what others' say.
Now we have a copy of fiemap and a pointer fiemap. Which one is the "right" one?
Excellent example and interesting discussion! Thanks everyone!

I'm trying to write a batch process that can take an MP3 file and mute certain parts of it, ideally in Python or Java. Take this example: Given a 2 minute MP3, I want to mute the time between 1:20 and 1:30. When saved back to a file, the rest of the MP3 will play normally -- only that portion will be silent. Any advice for setting this up in a way that's easy to automate/run on the command line would be fantastic!
Why do you set the value to true for the requiresAuthentication here since it is already set when you create the class !
@catsby is correct -- you'll want to use the to do this. SIDENOTE: Heroku's platform API is actually incredibly awesome. You can use it to scale dynos, set variables, provision / deprovision addons, etc.
I've been experimenting with Linq to see what it can do - and I'm really loving it so far :) I wrote some queries for an algorithm, but I didn't get the results I expected... the Enumeration always returned empty: case #1 I changed the query declaration to be inline like this, and it worked fine: case #2 Does anybody know why it doesn't work in case #1 ? The way I understood it, the query wasn't evaluated when you declared it, so I don't see how there is a difference.
I hate writing migrations, but it's important for the schemas to stay in sync. What I'd much rather do is update my and have Rails notice, then run something which generates the appropriate migration based on the difference between the old version and the current version. Is there a way I can do that?
No need for indirection here. Merge benchmarkTCPConcurrentReadWrite into this function, and use the addr "127.0.0.1:0" directly.
whenever i drag-n-drop a stored procedure onto my Context canvas, the parameters/arguments for the stored procedure are all nullable. Why is this? Is it because of how i've declared my parameters inside the stored procudure itself? Besides manually creating my stored procedure methods in the Context partial class (or drag-n-drop onto canvas, cut from autogen'd code, move to partial class, then remove nullables types) .. is there any way to fix this? It's really frustrating :(

I am trying to get Titanium Studio to work for some time now.. I am using Linux Mint XFCE Edition. I have to install nodejs and the packages titanium, alloy, acs, acs-node with npm. Now every time I install nodejs again and install a titanium or alloy via npm it creates a new directory I actually have a directory called in my root dir (where username is my username). All the other pacakages I need to install (acs, acs-node) give me: I really hope, someone can help me! I don't understand at all what is going on. I am installing nodejs from PPA: because the version from the Linux Mint repository are way to old. Any help very much appreciated!

I recently imported about 60k records into a table that relates data in one table to data in another table. However, my client has since requested that a sort order be added to all 60k records. My hope is there is a nice clean way to auto generate these sort orders in a SQL Update. The finished data should look something like this: Can this be done? Any suggestions would be hugely appreciated. --Anne
Hi I'm using the chrome inspector (F12) to try and analyze the z-index of a twitter bootstrap popover, and finding it extremely frustrating... Is there a way to freeze the popover (while shown) so that I can assess and modify the associated CSS? Placing a fixed 'hover' on the associated link does not cause the popover to appear.

Yikes, we are starting an RPC for every row in the table? My concern with this is the browser can only issue 4 requests at a time to the server. If a user has 50 items in their dashboard, which many do, this will take quite a few round-trips (13!) to completely load the status codes. Worse, if the user navigates away before they are completely done loading, they will continue to load, as there is no way to cancel the queued RPCs. I would prefer having myApprovals and strongestApprovals take a Set<Change.Id> and return a Map<Change.Id, Whatever>, and make only one call to each method for the dashboard.
is in so u need not to worry! Internally the data is always stored as TEXT, so even if you create table with , SQLite is going to follow the rules of data type
The logic to check for checkpoint restart was added in release-5-1, but in master we changed the name to startingFromCheckpoint
My goal is to write a cookie when the user authenticates. We are using a crappy framework that hides its source code and event model so when I use their login control I can't set a session timeout on it! Anyhow, I am trying to write a cookie when the user is logged in, and then refresh the cookie expire time on subsequent page views (sliding expiration). So I figured I could initially create the cookie during Application_AuthenticateRequest in teh global.asax but that seems to be firing even when the user hasn't signed in yet. Is that suppose to be the case?
We use Hessian in our software, and I wish the previous developers didn't do this as we now have to access the hessian endpoint from C++. It's a pain and I prefer things to be in simple HTTP xml or json.

This is the same as in the underlying OS calls, and this same construct is also used in the nbsearch pair loop, as it minimizes the amount of code the caller needs to write for correct looping (and is quite easy to implement, as there's only one function that returns something).
Hate to have to do this, but it works!
Old question, I know, but I found it while searching for a similar answer. Unless the API has changed, the reason why harpo's answer isn't working is because is an instance method, not a static method. But fear not--there's an instance of present in each instance of --the property. So in your case, if you're within a controller (or, I suspect, a view): That should do the trick!

How is determined which of the opcodes is actually taken during import of _xlfn.CEILING.MATH ? I think that's missing. Note that now that we use RID_STRLIST_FUNCTION_NAMES_ENGLISH_OOXML with the formula compiler, the tables in sc/source/filter/oox/formulabase.cxx are only provided for API support (of which we actually don't know if anyone is using it at all). Our internal OOXML import/export doesn't use them anymore, so any "only for import / only for export" usage needs to be implemented differently.

IMO it is painful to debug as you tend to have no intermediary variables for inspection.
planning to do that in a separate changelist for MB-14866: 1. merge lock with seqno_list into the same structure 2. maintain a vbMap instead of vbList in this service, so as to make vbno lookup/validation faster 3. do vbno validation in all relevant places in the service you mentioned that we could use list of list instead of map of list to avoid issues with map. Feel that it makes the code harder to read. we may have to understandard the behavior with maps anyway. Plan to make the changes above and see if the issue in MB-14866 re-cur.
Great question!! I'm hoping to use something like migrations with Django too.

I found this about wrapping strings using parens extremely useful, but is there a way in Vim to make this happen automatically? I want to be within a string, typing away, and have Vim just put parens around my string and wrap it as necessary. For me, this would be a gigantic time saver as I spend so much time just wrapping long strings manually. Thanks in advance. Example: I type the following text: Vim automatically does this when I hit column 80 with the string:
Yes, same happened to me ... sometimes defines can be really horrible.
I'm afraid I gave up and switched to django instead!

Unfortunately, I don't think so, since it probably contains the version of the metamodel which varies over time...
I'm writing an Eclipse plugin for the JDT. I need a functionality that tracks certain strings or regular expressions and possibly creates markers. I know that Eclipse already does that for //TODO comments, for example (creating task markers for them) but I'm not sure if I can use the same mechanism. I can write my own but worried it would be too inefficient and not sensitive enough to code chnanges.
$('li:nth-child(3), li:nth-child(4)').insertAfter('ul').wrapAll('')You can't "break a list". You can either A) remove it and replace it with two lists B) extract some elements to make another list with. The following is terrible terrible practice, but then again so is what you're asking...
Indeed, annoying even more as -i in POSTROUTING is already used in external_gateway_nat_rules (L1468)
What's the error message? and is that with the latest transform change?
For those of us who don't care about ivy in fact lose something - a easy to build hbase.
I'm wondering how Boxcar works, anybody knows? I know how to do the push notification from server to iPhone, but I have no clue of how to create the server to get the @reply and dm from twitter in real time. Any suggestion on what I should look into to create the server? Should I use Twitter's streaming API or User Streams API? Any sample code, in PHP preferably, will be great :) Thanks!
@Asad Actually do not need. I appended one letter at the end of each vowel and con table. @user3520307 My great pleasure to see my code be helpful!
I have a script in which I need to process a file using ajax. Everything in the script works, except I can not get the right variable. I have tried everything and I currently have this in its place I was wondering if anyone could tell me how to successfully set whatever is in this field As a variable in the ajax script that I have. All help is extremely appreciated, thanks for the help!
I'm not sure what the problem is but the behavior (at least in 0.1.4) is that the _isClosed AtomicBoolean is not being set to closed in a timely manner.
Yes the patch is badly named - sorry!
I do not like (long) very much, but that is something in the inode_ctx API :-/ Maybe I find the courage one day to make it a (void*) instead.
Does it make sense to start learning JavaFx if I do not have any background in UI programming? Is it more advisable to learn Swing first and then move on to JavaFx ? I tried the on JavaFx website in Netbeans and the code looked extremely complicated to me. I am wondering if JavaFx is too advanced for a beginnner GUI developer.
The usage of exception specification here is very bad! If any only exception is thrown, then the program will terminate. Imagine what will happen if that occurred in Slicer! Have you verified that not a single method usage can throw an exception of a different kind?
How can I get an array of pointers pointing to objects (classes) ? I need to dynamically allocate space for them and the length of array isn't determined until run-time. Can any one explain and tell me how to define it? and possibly explain them how it works, would be really nice :)
clock() is not accurate enough.
Got some code here that isn't working: Basically I have 3 lists and want to add a class (last) to each item appearing last in each unordered list. Hope that makes sense, Cheers!
There are still several rows for the distinct blocks and up to one separate row with no related block element, so we still need the gorup by clause
Hate to say it, but how about just testing it?
Thanks Myrna.
Phabricator is being a little buggy.
@Marc-AndrÃ© Lafortune Your answer there was incredibly helpful! Thank you!
Yup, for the better. It makes it harder to write hard to read code.
i found the class - so there is no bug - sorry
@param is missing In addition, I'd prefer to have a setter (or only getter that can be mocked) for this constant. This would be cleaner than having this as a method parameter.
I have two files. File 1: a FASTA file with gene sequences, formated like this example: File 2: A simple text file with JUST the accession identification of the gene. Like so. Every entry in File 2 is somewhere in File 1, but not every entry in File 1 is in File 2. I need to remove all the entries from File 1 that are not in File 2. I feel like there must be something in the biopython module that could help me, I just don't know what. For instance, I originally thought that I could extract just the accessions from my FASTA file using the function, but this really just lands me with two files of accession numbers. I don't know how to selectively extract the accessions that are in the other file. Maybe like reading all the entries from File 2 into a dictionary and then associated that entry with its matching entry in File 1 and use to extract the whole sequence...But I really don't know....Any help anyone could give me is extremely appreciated!
Excellent tips, thanks! Additionally you can try Clarity

Just use Skype. It's free, it has excellent chatting capabilities, works over firewalls, supports lots of collaboration features out of box and plenty more as plugins. P.S. It is also supported natively on Windows Mobile and has good clients on other mobile platforms (like Fring on S60)
I got very angry with Oracle today after reading lots of editable TableView solutions involving setOnEditCommit, which is just NOT the right way it should be done. Following is a much better and simpler solution I found after digging the JavaFX source:
We use Hessian in our software, and I wish the previous developers didn't do this as we now have to access the hessian endpoint from C++. It's a pain and I prefer things to be in simple HTTP xml or json.
I really like what I am seeing so far.
I lost the whole morning cause HBase's RegionServer was dying with no logs no nothing... how Am I supposed to debug the issue if u do not even generate a core dump?
I am writing a webPage using asp.net and c#. I want to divide my webpage into 2 columns such as in one I will have buttons that change the view in the other column, without "stepping on" the content of the first column. example: button 1 | :) a picture... button 2 | I tried to use divisions but I think I'm not using them properly. any help would be great! thanks!!!
I would love it in 3.3.2 will upload a patch for that version.
here we are changing the default to 0666 but in open it is 0777, we should have only one. I think 0777 was chosen based on what python os module does, but could be wrong...
@AndrewLazarus - Excellent point!!
sorry :)
Thank you @Ward! We're loving how easy it is to create the GUI with Breeze! If can just work out this part, we will have a great solution!
Thats sweet that you have the prior experience hacking this on top of a store already.
I find it comes back periodically. What's most frustrating about it is that everytime it does come back, it breaks WebDeploy as the account under which that runs does not have access to delete the aspnet_client folder created!
I believe Greg thinks there may be a performance difference depending on SSL termination in the pipeline - but I think he's wrong for our APIs and clients - we could test, or we can review after we get something working and revisit it later if there is problems.
I still think you also need to check that the $bi->get('blocktype') is allowed for $artefacttype->name. For example if I alter an internal media block to have the artefactid point to an image artefact I get this match: $artefacttype->name = image $a->get('artefacttype') = image $artefacttype->plugin = file $blocktype->artefactplugin = file So they are not seen as mismatched, but $bi->get('blocktype') = internalmedia so they should be mismatched as an internalmedia block can't have an image as its artefact. So we need to check not just if the plugin is correct (eg = 'file') but that the artefacttype is of the correct subset for the block (eg 'audio, video') for the block instance (eg 'internalmedia')
Love this solution!
Use tvb_ip_to_str. That should eliminate the need for arpa/inet.h
I created a Mastermind code and when I attempt to run it on my Mac it just says "logout". If anyone knows why, that would be extremely helpful! Here is the code:
Note that these can be usually written simpler as just "" instead of OUString().
Is there a selector you can use with $.closest so this doesn't look so godawfully clumsy?

That's what I was thinking, but I am afraid it will bring confusion to the structure. I will need to add "Set children" field to parent class which should not be used anywhere in the code, only for hibernate cascade deletion. Do you think it is ok?
The following will mirror your dev DB up to production on heroku: heroku rake db:push but what you probably really need(ed) to do was run the migration heroku rake db:migrate Good luck!
Most of the spring stuff looks like it can be found in the default m2 repo. Why do we need this? Also, milestone is wrong here.
I have just read and I really loved to the question. Naturally, an interesting question popped in my head... How to add my own events (of my own applications) in the Control Panel -> Sounds and Audio Devices -> Sounds -> Program Events? And another related question, that I suppose should be answered here as well is... How do I play those sounds specified in the Control Panel, when the event in my application occurs?
@KevinB what an excellent resource! That just made my life waaaaay easier!
Didn't notice the horrid inline jQuery, remove it! Then open the browser console (F12) and check for errors.
You might want to use a constant ScriptRunner.NOP instead.
@CarlNorum: That would be extremely annoying, given that the above is well-defined C89...
We have released a beta version of our software, and as we talked to people who started using it, we have found that a lot of the features (which we thought were essential) were not known and not used by the users. What are the possible ways to inform the application users about the features of the application? I personally find the "Tip of the day" popups extremely annoying and disable them quickly. Are there better ways?
I have an .ico file with 5 icon sizes embedded in it being used as the main application icon and the System Tray icon. When it shows up in the task bar the icon is using the 16x16 format which is desired. When the icon shows up in the Notification Area/System tray, it is using the 32x32 format and Windows is rendering it down to a 16x16 icon, which looks horrible. How do I force windows to use the 16x16 icon size in the notification area? Here's my code to put the icon in the system tray:
Then maybe the loop can be inside this method, it would be more consistent with the fact that 'Starts' is plural...
Weird.
unused parameter 'pinfo' [-Werror=unused-parameter]
On HTTP /abandon and /restore accept no body. This results in null being passed to the apply() method, which handles it gracefully by creating an empty input. I think its common to call /abandon and /restore with no input. Your tests are certainly showing that. Perhaps we should overload abandon() and restore() methods to also have a no-arg form that passes null to apply the same way the HTTP interface does when the client doesn't supply a body.
Thanks, everyone! I learned something extremely valuable :D So Linux doesn't stop at the 26th value?
I do have KWStyle but somehow I think it only complains if I have end-of-line whitespace. I'll remove the tabs.
Cool cool - thanks stack!
This could impact the development context when doing a partial compilation, is it noticable? We should re-use the filename (micro-op).
Just cleaning, this regex remove empty string concatenation: + ("") This can happen when we start a new group of concatenation (see appendConcatOperation()) and there is nothing to print afterwards. In this case the string ends with a concatenation of an empty string
Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this Seems like you commited some too much ;)
Thanks Owen!
I think it's time to just close this issue.
Nope, forgot to cherry-pick that one. Thanks for noticing, fixed.
If the string is boxed (ie. if the string is created in javascript new String("...")), it is no longer acts like java.lang.String in GWT lang. For example (aBoxedJsString instanceof String) will return false.
Hell UnaryFunction might even be faster than all of these calls in a row.
Change looks fine, but please fix up this bad rebase.
I really fail to see the use case... If you will type print_var_name($foobar) what's so hard (and different) about typing print("foobar") instead? Because even if you were to use this in a function, you'd get the local name of the variable... In any case, here's the in case there's something you need in there.
That means we'll have to add an extra boolean field to every member. It'll make serialization size bigger as well as resident AST memory go up. I'm happy to change it, but it seems like it trades off memory for readability. You'd still have to handle "", because that's the way Java annotations work, you cannot have a default value of 'null'
Well, you could play around a bit... What about a function that rewrites itself? Warning: This is extremely ugly and should not be used in production code!
That's excellent, and works absolutely beautiful!
Im maintaining a site where I need to 'click' a link with javascript. The href is inline javascript, not a url so I cant just navigate to that url instead. Im expect this is bad practice (the rest of the site is terrible!) but I need to make the link 'clicked' with javascript. Im using jQuery. I know this question has been asked before but it seems normally people are trying to follow the link, which I am not.
Put this into a DEPS variable and reuse the value above in gwt_module() too?
Is there a reason we are not doing stuff like the below, which seems to me would better across a wider range of machines: // lockFocusFlipped not available before OSX 10.6 if ([pimage respondsToSelector:@selector(lockFocusFlipped:)]) { [pImage lockFocusFlipped:YES]; } else { [pImage setFlipped: YES]; [pImage lockFocus]; }
I have a VB.NET MDI WinForms app. My users have been complaining about form creep (as they call it), this is where each time you open a specific form within the main MDI window it opens slightly below and to the right of the location it loaded previously - i.e. it starts in the top left of the window and works its way down to the bottom right. I have to agree with them that this is extremely irritating, is there any way to prevent this? The code to load the forms is: I can address this somewhat by setting the forms start-up positions to 'Manual' but then they just open directly on top of each other in the top left of the screen. Any other SO users come across this?
Excellent! it's very useful to me!
If I get a chance I may even roll it into our dev environment but I am currently in the middle of mem leak hell.
the propvalue parameter type is not quite idiomatic ;) In general - since this method gets called multiple times, prolly worth buffering the xml ...
I am planning to use this framework for some new RPCs I am adding.
Excellent! I hope you liked the `$.when.apply(...)` with its double nested .joins. That's the bit I had to test.
+1 for the `/* God I hate Microsoft! */` comment in the IE7 stylesheet.
I've used on pretty complex websites with great success :) One caveat through (this applies to all "fixes" i believe) is that you can not make a background image of an element be transparent.
Calculate the height is easy, enjoy: Hope it will help! UPDATE!!! You only need: Instead of:
I agree this can be discovered without the text. Deleted the comment. Same in OpenKey.
a bit weird that you have this error change in Populate but not in the constructor
It seems to me to be the case. There is a bug: https://b.corp.google.com/issues/17586779 shertz probably knows more about it.
I had a memory crash on UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext() ... if you're creating and releasing a lot of them, you should wrap them in a fresh AutoReleasePool for each iteration. Even allowing the NSRunLoop to tick WAS NOT ENOUGH for Apple/iOS to do housekeeping on garbage lying around from this. e.g.
Although that text editor test isn't 15 minutes, it sounds like an excellent test. It's more like what you would do in real life compared to writing algorithms: maintain code that someone else might have made.
Please forget last comment it is incorrect.
To address the previous concerns about constructing a massive QByteArray in the case of no terminating character: I set pos2 to pos so that the QByteArray is empty in that case.
Thanks to your excellent instruction, I understood enough to figure out what was going on and also what was needed! Here's what I came up with. It's clunky but it does the job! Thanks again everyone.
I'm sorry.
Sorry I see that you say the same Mike :)
Sorry should have commented on this much sooner.
as noted in patch set 2, message should be: CANNOT REMOVE STORAGE POOL WITH NON MASTER DOMAINS or something.
All macros in southbridge.h are Vortex86EX PCI S/B config register offsets. They are all fixed for Vortex86EX CPU.
I got to this question via the Almighty Google. To complement on what Andrew said above, for those of you on OSX you might want to take a peek at /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/Resources/vim/runtime/indent/html.vim and the modifications necessary should become evident. I can't believe I spent so much time suffering from poorly indented <li>s!
This is excellent! :)
Great! Absolutely wonderful! Thank you very much!
Android camera stuff is extremely frustrating, I understand that. Make sure to read through all of the and check out this code below referenced from :
Please don't do that. We manipulate DateTimeUtils.setCurrentMillisProvider to achieve what you want. Check ChangeEditIT for example: [1], Methods annotated with @Before and @After. * [1] https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/master/gerrit-acceptance-tests/src/ test/java/com/google/gerrit/acceptance/edit/ChangeEditIT.java#116
Same remark here. Please write here why this routine does it.
Two excellent answers, thank you! I chose Andrew's primarily because I learned a bit more about knockout from it, but both are good options. I'd use RP's method to get something to use in a more generic "anything can be chosen" scenario, but I think making it a single object is probably a better fit for my uses.
Thanks, after using it for a couple of hours, I can say that's a great soft, definitely!
Indeed, thanks. I discovered this myself early last week, and addressed it in I82ff6602af3bf5 so that we use gcc 4.9.3 on slaves where that matters. Love these commercial-grade compilers!
is there a way to automatically call a function using an event after the user has browsed a file using a I've been trying to find something for the past hour but failed horribly, I saw that I should try onchange but that also failed..
Excellent, thanks!
Sorry guys... :( I was the reason for this trouble.
That commit mentions that a GCC 5 change motivates forbidding -fPIE, but I haven't seen any reason to also forbid it for GCC 4. That configuration has been "not broken" since Qt 5.0. Maybe some rationale for that can be put into the changelog too, because it would seem easy to check __GNUC__ before deciding to #error. There *are* also people using boost build and other non-qmake, non-cmake buildsystems too, so limiting the #error could have been wise.
s/importsSet/pkgSet/ should explain that this set is only needed so we can create an duplicate free pkgList
This is an excellent question. I look forward to hearing an answer.
That looks like an excellent technique and pretty much negates my question! :)
that's some very dangerous advice!
The best resource I've found about web security with ASP.NET is the below, written by Troy Hunt: Absolutely priceless! He even made an ebook out of it that you can download as a pdf:
use macro VKEY_FEATURES_INODE_QUOTA and VKEY_FEATURES_QUOTA
One of the IIS developers has an excellent walkthrough here: However, for the love of god why?
Yeah, I know, I just can't figure out where the 'private' is coming from. It's very frustrating!
Not an answer, but why on earth would you want 32,000 items in a combo box? That is a terrible way to store that much data.
no i got errors saying undefined, the swf code loads the other pages such as back buttons etc. it very frustrating tearing my hair out!
I have a password that I want to store as property in a Web Part that can be set via the tool pain. Currently it is a String and can be clearly read. How would I go about making it * out? If this is the wrong way to be doing this what would you advice to do instead?
"Add test(s) performing the static code analysis using CppCheck"
From my experiences so far, I've concluded that the HTML5 Manifest scheme was really terribly designed. My site serves a manifest file when a user is logged in. Unfortunately, when they log out, they can still access the cached protected materials. Can anyone think of a way to fix this?
There's an RFC for how to read RFCs. Love it!
The previous solution is really great! However, I'm looking for one more feature: is it possible to eager load last subordinate record before a specific date? This is needed so that my users can browse a history a song's votes (with links to previous and next days).
I need to develop a messenger-like text box, where certain tokens are being replaced with UI controls. Just for example, if the user types :-) it should be replaced with a smiley image. I have previous experience with WPF's RichTextBox and i understand the concept of TextPointer and TextContent. I just don't know how to replace a TextRange with a UI control... Would extremely appreciate your help :-) ! Gili
It makes sense that this is for the IOMMU since family 15 model xxx are the only parts that support it.
Actually it is just moved, disregard the comment on v1
FlexMonkey may be more of a pain than it is worth. Gorrilla Logic claims it works with custom components but I have found this is not the case. Anything with a renderer seems to have serious problems. It is a lot harder to set up tests than they claim and the tests aren't stable. I have written tests for one component 5 times now using hardcoded ids. Sometimes it just can't see the component and it dies. They only have 3 short paragraphs explaining tests in their user guide and they only respond to questions about how to set it up on their google group. I would avoid using this.
You could try this one (not optimal, I am afraid):
There is no putComment method. Shorten this and just put it on one line: checkState(psId != null, "setPatchSetId must be called first"); Developers debugging a failure can look at the Java stack trace to see how they got into this situation. What matters to them more is the call site where the object was misused, not which entry point into the object the error was discovered by.
You should really check out this plugin: I have been using it for about 10 sites and it's really great! Since the latest update it's posible to export your custom fields to a PHP file which you can include your functions.php
If the different segments are somewhat homogeneous then these stats should pretty much be very close anyway.
Not sure why all these if statements are necessary... see the definition for optional_str() on line 579
umm ... call me crazy but why are we making this public?
+1: Serialization can be a pain. This really helped me out.

FF @ fault? Damn... hate when my buddy fails me.
You should fix the libraries that are creating bad or non-named threads. I'd hate to debug your libraries' threads only to find that the names where changes elsewhere.
I am getting very strange flickering on a WPF application of mine. It only happens with alpha blended content, only on my computer, and only with WPF applications. At least I haven't noticed it with anything else. It's really annoying! Has anyone else dealt with this weirdness?
By definition, nothing is required when we have macros telling whether it is present or not. To avoid having to update this file every time something in one of the implementation files changes, I would move that documentation there. This file is simply about SIMD and defining SIMD properties, not about what SIMD instructions are used in different kernels. Specific comments about verlet kernels belong in the verlet kernel code, not here.
@Colin Pickard: That's really sad :'( :'( :'(
what I want to know is, what does create? what can I do with it? what does it mean? Every tutorial without fail will avoid talking about the first version entirely The reason the tutorial doesn't rell you what to do with it is that it really is totally useless! It allocates a single and gives you a pointer to that. The problem is that if you want an int, why don't you just declare one?
I suggested to add aliases = {"-#tag"} in this comment: https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/60106/8/gerrit-server/ src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/server/git/ReceiveCommits.java@1155
been looking at this for days..
+1 for *"...the debate was about **what** was actually meta data."*
If you only need the count (like you express in your original question), you could do: Hope it helps!
Works great! And you can add "desc" after the end to sort in other direction. In which case the strings will show first. I like how this solution doesnt actually pad the numbers in the result output.
Sorry for the noise.
> The flag package is ideally only imported in main. Where did this notion of "ideal" come from? The advice I usually hear (and give) is: don't register flags except from the main package, because you're mutating a global variable. This utility function doesn't touch any global variables. Isn't its purpose pretty obvious from the usage example above?
For C# Visual Studio uses 4 spaces by default, whereas for C++ it is hard-tabs. Why is it so? Why is it different? My project consists of both C# and C++ code and the difference really annoys me. I want to set a common standard for all the sources, but I wonder if this would have any drawbacks.
My form receives asynchronous callbacks from another object on random worker threads. I have been passing the data to the main thread (where it can be used to update onscreen controls) using delegates as shown below. Performance is dreadful -- once I reach 500 updates per second, the program completely locks up. My GUI processing itself is not the problem, as I can simulate this level of updating within the form and have no problems. Is there a more efficient mechanism I should be using to hand off the data from thread to thread?
I have discovered a mode in , where I can instantly change all same variables. When I am in this mode I get a box around the same variables and I can change one and instantly all others change. I do not know how to enter this mode "by will", I just entered it "randomly". Therefore, I really appreciate your suggestions, how to enter this mode, because it is extremely useful to me! PS.: I am using NO plugins, just a plain new eclipse installation with java!
@massive I've replied to your question about dealing with concurrency issues in bulk updates by editing my answer. Hope this helps!
This question is awfully vague.. and doesn't seem to have anything to do with programming..
tabs instead of whitespaces as in the rest of the file
Secondly reading this code I can see why this bug is happening after completing stage 2 above when adding the new item the code does "ordered - cancelled = quantity" which equates to "1 - 1 = 0".
I'm looking for an XSL lint tool which is actively maintained. The only one I can find is , but the last update was in 2000 (9 years old!). Any help would be great!
Loved this solution!
Thanks Andrew - the patch was applied to SQL module at r525019.
I just followed your excellent recommendation --- thanks! :-)
very kind :) Paul S. approach is a good one as it acts like a polyfill.
whenever i drag-n-drop a stored procedure onto my Context canvas, the parameters/arguments for the stored procedure are all nullable. Why is this? Is it because of how i've declared my parameters inside the stored procudure itself? Besides manually creating my stored procedure methods in the Context partial class (or drag-n-drop onto canvas, cut from autogen'd code, move to partial class, then remove nullables types) .. is there any way to fix this? It's really frustrating :(
What a sad answer!! Maybe I can just don't install it, and leave the hell to user.
I've used Clojure, it's great for an ex-Lisper! I may do it opposite from you and learn Haskell next.
@KunalK: excellent ! worked for me . If you put this as answer then I can accept it . And it will helpful in future .
You may want to check for NULL because cbmem allocations can fail.
This is a weird format. It won't close twice actually, and it's not to handle the exception. There is an infinite loop from L1537 to L1581. In each iteration, it opens the zipfile. Before getting into another iteration, it needs to close the zipfile... I've moved L1583 inside the loop to make it less weird.
Damn Chuck is scary.
It's not clear to me what this really does. Given: Dir("a", "b", "c") Does this create c as a file or an empty directory? The name 'Dir' suggests the latter, but the comment seems to suggest the former.
I am trying to make Authlogic and Facebook Connect (using Facebook) play nice so that you can create an account either the normal registration way or with Facebook connect. I have been able to get the connect to work one way but logging out only loggs out on facebook and not on my site, I have to delete the cookies to make it working. Any help would be awesome, thank you!
The answer can be found in the . You should skim the excellent documentation that comes with Perl
Is it to use the ViewData argument? As you already have seen that would be absolutely horrible. What I want to know is this: What is the recommended way to pass this sort of layout configuration to the partial view? By using a view model of course: and then: and then: and then: and then: and so on...
Doc string needs to be changed. This does not return anything. it can be something like- This function verify detail of referenced datastore.
By the way, why are you adding patches for specific platform w/o $(if $(filter blah?
+1 for the excellent approximation!
In addition to firebug (which should be your first port of call), the will also tell you where a given style is sourced from, just in case IE - shock, horror - should be different.
Not only that, but as the software ages they feel the need to upgrade simply because they know, every time they reference it, that they're using Office 1997, for example. Great for upgrade encouragement! Although even better is a message on the splash screen, "Version 2008 is available now!"
I am about to alter the several tables in a massive system which I probably only understand around 10%. I want to add three columns. One of these is just a rename of an existing column. Part of me wants to :- Rename the column but worried about the impact on unknown parts of the system that use the old name. Append the three columns to the table therefore making the old column redundant (over time).
Yup many hours later I found that a single panel that was wrapped around the section had a EnableViewState="false" added to it. Sad part is that I know I didn't add that because I didn't even know what it was until craig here mentioned it. Visual Studio must have added it sometime.
I think that's just a mistake in make.bash. It's better to fail fast and minimize distractions to stderr when you know you've already lost. I'd say add an exit failure here and then submit. If you feel strongly about keeping it as-is, you can submit this too and we can fix them both later if we decide to.
This answer is not optimal because I have no clue which Konrad you are referring to.
Damn maven!
Doc string needs to be changed. This does not return anything. it can be something like- This function verify detail of referenced datastore.
You removed this line in I1c2a5a9c3da5 with a commit message that noted you wanted COM removal only in the second half of VV, but there was no related change to how that worked. How do we assess when you were right? :-D

It would be super great! if you can help me with iframe and cookies stuff... data.message contains URL
The built in ones are awful. You can easily write your own RSS, RDF and ATOM parsers. I have a tutorial and a full visual studio project you can download that does just that http://www.jarloo.com/rumormill-5/
This is a refactoring from my side that sneaked in when I split the commit. I'll revert this asap since it adds nothing to this change.
eXcellent, superb, charm :) Thank you!
So very cool and so very committed-- thanks Matthias this is awesome.
How can I get my Error, Logcat, Debug, etc. tabs to go back to the bottom-middle of Eclipse? For some reason, they moved up between the Package Explorer and the code editor in a vertical arrangement - I really hate it when sections of an IDE break off and dock to some seemingly arbitrary area.
Why do you not want to store it in the assets folder? That's what it's for. Regardless, you can't reference your local hard drive for it. (also, personal opinion, Monotype Corsiva is a horrible, horrible font) EDIT: So I would add, you should be able to do it the way you're doing it, you just can't use your local hard drive. Just get a reference to your TypeFace as a , depending on where you are saving them (e.g. ) and use .

+1 Because seriously, this question hasn't been asked yet? I remember getting incredibly frustrated the first time I had to figure it out.
Well asp.net is problematic by itself in many ways. I can only imagine how the page is coded, but mostly asp.net submits are done in a very painful way through _doPostback where it sets additional hidden fields. You might want to try reading this and reviewing the generated html of the page
Please explain on why it is been taken out from the switch case below.
sorry.
Ah, good catch. I didn't see the enclosing call to the Title class there. I was assuming the output of $request->getVal( 'title', '' ); was being passed to $request->getVal( 'returnto', .. ); Seems some really nasty logic going on with re-using variables and type-casting to strings etc.

Thanks for all your input. I came across this extension and it worked REALLY GREAT for me!
I have implemented this in my Visual Studio addon Visual Installer as IntelliSense Member Completion.If you type variable followed by a period (.) a list of all possible members of this class is presented in a list from which you can choose:Second option is to move cursor over any class to view it's members:See details here: http://www.unsigned-softworks.sk/visual-installer/features.html#member-completionP.S. sorry for this self promo - TLama is very angry for promoting 3rd party software in Inno questions but there is no support for this in official Inno Setup editor and many people ask for this.
If all you are doing here is testing that the object returned by Network.get_by_id is passed to the allocated_fixed_ip() method properly along with some other arguments, the more clean and canonical way of doing that would be this: @mock.patch('nova.objects.Network.get_by_id', return_value=mock.sentinel.network) def test_add_fixed_ip_instance_using_id_without_vpn(self, get_by_id_mock): net_id = networks[0]['id'] with mock.patch.object(self.network, 'allocated_fixed_ip') as allocate_mock: self.network.add_fixed_ip_to_instance(self.context, FAKEUUID, HOST, net_id) get_id_mock.assert_called_once_with(self.context, net_id, project_only='allow_none') allocate_mock.assert_called_once_with(self.context, FAKEUUID, mock.sentinel.network, address=None)
so im using a simple submit binding to pass a function data: i just started working with KO so i was to write a basic print function to test this input out: my problem is when i hit submit i get a "you entered: undefined" but when i refresh the page the input that is in the form gets an alert. this is very frustrating! idk if this is a knockout problem or a simple HTML one.
I am working on an opensource app that using SubSonic 2.0.3 I need to regenerate some of the code so I need the tool that does that. I cannot find this version 2.0.3 of the code generator executable. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Sorry about that.
Thanks Arvind
+1 pines is excellent!
The previous solution is really great! However, I'm looking for one more feature: is it possible to eager load last subordinate record before a specific date? This is needed so that my users can browse a history a song's votes (with links to previous and next days).
Sorry for the huge delay Fabio.
Excellent answer! Bonus marks for humour!
Sorry folks the full fix was committed in rather a messy manner due to some platform specific issues.
It is possible to kept alcatel-lucent.xylan (and remove the other) Xylan has buy by Alcatel in 1999... (if i remember..)
Let's imagine something like this: Later I can do something like this: Is there any way I can set the limit when using the named query, and not when defining it? I'd would really love to do something like: or Thx in advance! :-)
([0-1 ]?[0-9]|2[0-3]):([0-5][0-9]) I think that's the regex you're looking for (not specifically for javascript though). This site has an excellent amount of info for language-specific regular expressions! Cheers!
Thanks for fixing it. > What if the author disagrees with your negative vote and writes a reply to your comment explaining why he disagrees? If this change is filtered out there is a high chance to you miss this reply. But with this argumentation it is even more dangerous for me how it was originally: -label:Code-Review=-2,user=self Why? I am maintainer and have power of -2. I review a change and decide to put my veto on it. But we all do mistakes, we all have feelings? In the end we are all people. What is if it was a wrong veto? The contributor try to explain me, in additional comments why he thinks the veto was wrong and that the impact of the change is *very* minimal and that thousands of people from hundreds of companies can't upgrade to the new version of the product and all that because of his veto. Nothing helps. Why? Because I used your dashboard template, put this line and this change was filtered out: -label:Code-Review=-2,user=self
Sorry that should have said fixed via HADOOP-4980 not 6980.
There is an really excellent short(!) book on Stripes that covers all aspects: by Frederic Daoud (Pragmatic Programmers)
Not to worry I've SOLVED it!
don't remove this comment here! the require once is obsolete only
I did not suggest that the acquire/release functions would be called globally for all NI. I said "each time an interface that needs the acceptor". If the interface doesn't use the acceptor don't call acquire at startup, and don't call release at shutdown. I don't much care about the length of the list or the time involved. I am looking for code that is more easy to read and maintain.
Take a look at [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18646797/2697658). Hope it helps!
I loved the visualization of the race. Well done.

Hey, I am trying to further my knowledge of javascript and was wondering if anyone could explain to me what exactly is happening in the script below: Most importantly, why are there 4 'google_ ad_ ...' at the beginning and what is the purpose of them? A line by line explanation would be awesome :) Thanks for any help. I really appreciate it.
But definitely agree that in 99% of cases office interop is horrible.
except doesn't this failure mean "i couldn't read the command file"? for which "no command" doesn't seem like a bad error.
Can't find any manual about changing width of taglist element size. Taglist element is wider than icons I had set. It looks really awful =( Screenshot:
This method looks really strange, it seems to allow to get or create a view model context at the same time. The parameter set is confusing. It is not part of this review, but please add a BR to discuss this separatly
it seems to me that this operation is not optimal as it would try to find a number in a list, while you only need to check it against 0, 4095 boundaries.
Great! Awesome work Nick and thanks for the clarification Bill.

This way lies metadata hell.
Oh, yea, didn't notice, answers below this one are at most half a year old.
I was afraid of that!
Thanks Todd glad to be on board!
You would need to create a counter integer variable that can keep track of the line index for you. Hope it helps!
when i was suggesting flipping the boolean, i did also wonder whether we wouldn't be better off just passing in the length. if it's <= 0, interpret that as "don't know"? that would then move 8192 down out of the callers too. or... i really like the way you went for readFully rather than implementing the missing read()s, which is what i'd actually imagined. how about we go one further and just have a static fromFile or similar? then it could do the stat, and have everything it needs. you could even use Libcore.os open/fstat/read/close to avoid the RandomAccessFile without increasing the overall amount of code.
Excellent question.
I agree. Excellent update. +1.
if you put editable, no need for editableOnTemplate, its good for both
I found this code (full version here ) It's work for me but now i don't know how to stop it (for making test it's horrible, my new php file not interpreted!)
Yes, I hate how Skype tries to use port 80... I sometimes forget to change it, and then when I try to test some web thing I've written, Apache won't start.
That's one bit of excellent logic! Thank you so much!
Lambdas automatically 'suck' in local variables, I'm afraid that's simply how they work by definition.
_Automagically_ appending data to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` sounds scary!
This seems fairly trivial but is giving me hella grief! I have a module in the lib folder. The controller. config/Application.rb And I get this error I know the module is loaded correctly. What am I doing wrong?
It is a core class, why should it be independent from core usage? "If you just assign an end date you have to jump in the source code to become an idea how the start date is resolved." This can be written into the function comment, so if we may change $GLOBALS['EXEC_TIME'] we do not need to change so much calls.
This may result in broken implementations since they could already have a longer URL. Highly unlikely, but possible.
There is no need for a "continue" here, since it means the same as the normal program flow...
I have the following code: This code causes python to go in an infinite recursive loop, and the output is actually incredibly cool: This keeps growing exponentially :) Its pretty but why is this happening?
That's pretty unlikely.
cpu_allocation_ratio is a global config option fro the core filter - not a per hypervisor setting ?
Shit I missed a cast.
You should definitely check out Jon Rista's three-part series on .NET 2.0 configuration up on CodeProject. Highly recommended, well written and extremely helpful! He shows how to create and use custom configuration sections, and goes on to explain how to use your own custom.config instead of or in addition to standard .NET config files. Marc
I have a main flash from wich i load another swf file from the server. From time to time i change the second swf file and want to load a fresh copy from the server. I clean the cache from the browser but my client does not know how to do that and it's a pain to give him directions. If i want to load a fresh copy of the main swf i just add a "main.swf?version2" but i can't do that with the loadMovie function in flash. Any ideas how i can get a fresh copy from the server without changing the name of the file?
The column names shouldn't be in curly brackets, because that adds the dbprefix, and we only want that on the table names.
It would be sad:(
When I try to generate an app with almost all the I have tried reinstalling both bowline and bowline-bundle separately with But I have no clue where I am at. Could someone please enlighten me on this issue, would be very greatful!
but, that is supposed to be there. I think it's confusing having some functions being vbucket_* and some others being lcbvb_* -- so that's why the comment is there, so I can fix this up at a later commit. Let me do that right now actually.. http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/CCBC-431

More than a year after this post, we are using: Activiti a workflow engine with BPMN 2.0 support. As modeller we use Activiti Designer and Yaoquiang (excellent tool!).
I think this can be refactored (with the RTU "duplication") into the Modbus dissector.
Effective, but what a pain! You'd think there'd be an easier way.
another note for future patch: replace static references by the proper Dao getter.
I'm using some modifications to Glenn Berry's excellent DMV queries! However, I would like to add to the resultset the 'last server restart', or to be more specific, the date/time the statistics for (all, the specific) DMV was reset. Since it would be quite important to know last reset when looking at the statistics, I want to make absolutely sure the date/time is accurate and shown. Question: How can you get the most accurate date/time of when a/all DMV statistic was reset? Thanks! -D
it is being deprecated because it is old and unsafe. switch now or feel the pain later!

Took me a few seconds to get it but then I realized how awesome it is.
dict_ref (src->ctx) would ensure that ctx is not destroyed with the destruction of the @src event.
great question, wondering it myself!
Hi, Correct me if i'm wrong - but, we have 2 instances of commands in the flow you described. This means they do not share state. The change done by Arik adds messages on the canDoActionMessages() collection of each one of the commands. Not sure how you're going to have this mix.
Sorry yes I believe this has been resolved.
Someone but I'm not sure who owes me a public apology here. /Larry
Finally closing this bug from hell.
as you suggested (in person) that probably should go into a template
Be consistent about inner class references. Here you use Metadata but above you use SecureStoreLoadUtil.Metadata. In this case I am OK with either form in the class but want them to be consistent within the ~60 lines of code you have.
AFAIK, the creator of DelphiCodeToDoc is actually still actively working on it. Have you tried sending him an e-mail? In my experience, he's very helpful!
IMO it is painful to debug as you tend to have no intermediary variables for inspection.
Oh, man, I am sorry but I must say it: your code is really awful... It is not organised at all, but maybe... shouldn't be instead? EDIT: try to comment the second and third queries, since they seem useless, and make the "cur" -> "cursor" change I suggested:

I have a gridview with rows that can be edited, inserted etc. I wrapped it in an updatepanel to give it an AJAX effect and update the system without reloading the page. I recently got into using jQuery and webservices for my AJAX calls and I absolutely love how it works and how fast it is. I would like to know if it is possible, and if so then how, to update my gridview using jQuery AJAX methods.
It proved the point. They are very excited about SO now.
Fantastic answers! Thanks a ton!

We don't need to drop the function as it will be dropped in the function db_create_trigger()
Not related, but may be better to move to constructPorperty(String suffix) or something like that.

You are going to kill me when I say this but it seems like we should just commit your first patch.
First of all I can't see object locking, unused lockObject variable makes me sad. IEnumerable is not special. Each thread will have it's own copy of reference to some instance of sektioner object. You can't affect other threads that way. What would happen with old version of data pointed by sektioner field largely depends on calling party.
Only the PatchSet.Id is required here. So cd.change(db).currentPatchSetId() is a better approach.
Thanks for fixing it so quickly!
This will add an new <input name="ajax"> everytime I change the switch. Please add the code to make sure only one is appended.
Excellent! Thanks very much. Don't understand why I did not try to find it myself. Thanks again.
Yeah, I know, I just can't figure out where the 'private' is coming from. It's very frustrating!
i did some refactoring and missed changing this name. thanks for catching it
That is really, really, really smart! Thanks.
Please use gboolean (here and for the return value and etc) since that appears to be how this is actually used.
this is per loc_handle which is CHANGELOG_CATALOG handle. This should remain here and set per each MDT catalog but not per whole context.

it seems to me that this operation is not optimal as it would try to find a number in a list, while you only need to check it against 0, 4095 boundaries.
Prefer ordered includes, i.e. VTK headers, vtksys headers, STL/system headers.
VirtualBox (after version 1.3.8, anyway) will let you map incoming connections in the NAT configuration. There's an excellent tutorial on that describes the steps to configure port mapping.
Horray for Android!
It's a command-line tool. Unforunately Xcode doesn't use CodeSense for editing files outside a project, which is incredibly frustrating.
Excellent! Exactly what I needed :)
I need to develop a messenger-like text box, where certain tokens are being replaced with UI controls. Just for example, if the user types :-) it should be replaced with a smiley image. I have previous experience with WPF's RichTextBox and i understand the concept of TextPointer and TextContent. I just don't know how to replace a TextRange with a UI control... Would extremely appreciate your help :-) ! Gili
I would like to rewrite in C++, but that requires all the calling programs to be C++ too. Will do that in a separate patch.

Function is returning a guint. What's the intent of value -1? Are there cases where we cannot find the DNP header immediately?
If you can edit the code, you should just re-write it to use a custom API that does what you want. Failing that, use Maximilian's technique, but be warned that it is a maintenance horror. If you cannot edit the code, you can patch the import tables to redirect calls to your own code. A description of this technique can be found in - search for the section titled "Spying by altering of the Import Address Table". This is dangerous, but if you're careful you can make it work. Also check out , which does the same sort of thing but doesn't require you to mess around with the actual patching.
This is great! Thanks +1
Tried it again - it worked. God I hate reporting services!
I guess above versioning should be updated since API changed
For coreboot, maybe you could insert: assert(OpFlag == AccessWidth8); before the "if" to ensure that coreboot users aren't tripped up. I'm the first guy to discourage unnecessary changes to vendorcode, but this code is broken and we should somehow warn users about it. It would be even better if we could make the code fail by static analysis instead of a runtime assert.
I'm using Rob Con's repository pattern also - absolutely love it. But i'm not worrying about concurrency checks. I load the most recent object, then update the fields the submitchanges. I would look at seeing if you could use the Attach and/or timestamps. It's been a while since i've looking into linq + concurrency.
Never been this frustrated before... I HATE UIs! Will have to deal with them one day
How do I change the position of the sort button in header of the grid in Tapestry 5? I have column names of different lengths and I break lines on spaces, so the button, which is appended to the end of the column names, always ends up in different height. And that is very ugly :(
That is great news!
My point is that let's maintain our own configs even fi they are the same as the default ones, and change them soon by considering various factors including perf results.
could you explain why we need wrap this code in GuiActionRunner?
An excellent and elegant solution. Kudos.

I think the per stream flow control won't be implemented. Please double check with Mike and remove this code in case it won't be implemented (and update/get the spec updated).
I have a query that has approx 20 columns and I would like to export this to an Excel file with the column headers. I thought this would be easy to figure out but no luck! I searched the web and found one suggestion that did not end up working so I am stuck. Anyone have any working ideas? Thanks,
should the version be changed now that some methods are not available?
(minor) Why out that in a comment instead of just using $((1024 * 2048)) below?
Excellent!!! This is exactly what I am looking for!
So sorry I can't be more obliging.
It's now streaming the progress to the client. Done
Thanks Ivan.
:) Sorry about that.
+1: Serialization can be a pain. This really helped me out.
If you handle the RowDataBound event you can check the value of the data and modify the attributes of the cell or apply a different style in that event handler. That should give you what you are looking for. Let me know if you need it in VB rather than C#. Good Luck!
Oopps bad move !
You should use a different filter name as you cannot mix FT_UINT64 (hf_glusterfs_size64) and FT_UINT32 (hf_glusterfs_size). See doc/README.dissector chapter 1.5.1.
yeah, compiled, but output is so horrible !!!
Qianshi is working on the SSL session reuse but this buggy Bug system does not allow him assign this ticket sigh
Excellent - thanks !
Excellent question. Running a large project in successive version of Python wouldn't be very definitive, unless you had, say, unit tests that magically achieved 100% code coverage, so a tool like this would be nice to have.

Wow that's a very interesting question! I'm not exactly a pro at 16-bit C++ so I wonder why do you swap stacks at all?
Excellent - I've unaccepted the original answer. I shall try this tomorrow. Thanks both of you.
The search term on both Stackoverflow and PInvoke.net yields zero results, so this should be worth asking. I've been fiddling around on MSDN and looking through Win SDK *.h files all day, and feeling a bit out of my element. I'm basically attempting to query the MSRPC endpoint mapper with managed code. Here is what I have so far: The above code isn't complete, but it illustrates my point. The code consistently returns: RpcMgmtEpEltIngNext: 87 87 meaning Parameter is Incorrect according to . So I'm basically stumped at this point, and I'm sure it's because of my extremely crappy PInvoke code.
I just updated my MacVim to 7.3 and with it, it now changes directories to whatever file I'm currently editing. I use PeepOpen, so it's incredibly annoying to cd back to my project directory every time I want to edit a new file.
Excellent! Just what i needed!
I don't know how the hell my diff program decided to add seemingly random CR chars but I've removed them now.
Ok wow welcome to Linux hell...
s/importsSet/pkgSet/ should explain that this set is only needed so we can create an duplicate free pkgList
Unfortunately some projects require hundreds of images for CSS, general site images and flash then there can be hundreds of PDF's, Docs which are needed for the site. Including them can mean it takes ages to load a project and sync it. If your unlucky enough to use VSS then this is far more painful.
#NAME?
What status is the best here? I cannot use status from the current response here, also I don't know status of the other responses here.
Most of the times when Iphone program crash, compiler show stack with full of no's, but these no's don't make any sense to me. Very rarely it point out where the problem might be and mostly there are these useless no's. How you can make sure that when your program crashes while development/testing, it shows at what place this cause this crash?
Flow control keywords must be followed by a single space
is a really great option for git. Most of the free, public hosting sights will insist that you license your code with an OSS license (and, possibly, your documentation). That's potentially a different thing that you're talking about (backups). For just backups, you may want to try a for-pay service or even something like .
I opened [HADOOP-3607] to fix a wrong URL but appart from that I don't there's still references to the old structure.
I got the idea for adding such a message from your change (only you had it even more verbose adding a message per approval that was copied). I can try to incorporate this into the patch set created message, but not sure if this is easily possible.
yeah it working fine :) Thanks !!
I could easily be wrong about that, most of my work is this horrid single threaded behemoth..
The doxygen documentation will also be a bit better if you add \related ArrayRef to these functions (and similarly for the ConstArrayRef ones).
Sorry. I did not closely looked into log date part. Thanks for this patch
totally awesome
with the suggested while loop this would become i =0
Actually this is tricky to use an enum because this is going to be mostly dynamic based on the content of the images folder.
actually, if we get rid of nIndex, we would have to change a lot of code, because in this one, the Insert method returns the index of the inserted/already existing element.
FindBugs is complaining about these parameters being null.
Is there a shorthand for a new line character in Scala? In Java (on Windows) I usually just use "\n", but that doesn't seem to work in Scala - specifically outputs in Eclipse, (sic) from the command line, and from the REPL (GREAT SUCCESS!) works, but is there anything shorter?
The toolchain file should stop here. It should be about description and setting compilers. Period. See http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Cross_Compiling. I figure the principle is that the toolchain files are somewhat transferable between projects.
You probably need to check for divide-by-zero here, since addr_len comes from compr, which is based on packet data.
I want to change an image of an UIImageView from the applicationDidFinishLaunching method of the app delegate class. But I am afraid that this class doesnt know much about the controller outlet. What must I do in this case?
That's terrific, thank you!
@RogerRowland: Everything else works. All my apps, including VS, and my other dev projects. So I'm really afraid to break all of them.
You already have a great answer, but I wanted to give you a resource so you don't actually have to install IE8. You can use this site to test IE6-9, FF2-4, Chrome 5-6, Safari 3-5, and Opera 9-10. It's a really excellent tool!
frame := getcallersp(unsafe.Pointer(&siz)) Delete next three lines. Also, given that now it's just the callersp, s/frame/sp/ everywhere, including in the defer struct field name.
:) :) :) :) :) :)
I'm trying to insert the following array ( from a html form ) but i believe i'm working with this array in a very awful way The array: Actual code: ?> current output: What would be a decent way to do it? EDIT : No need to show how to connect to a database, i just need to deal with the array data.
Excellent, thanks!
Replace with a constant or use String.format("$0 $2",icon.getLocaion(),e.getLocalizedMessage())
In my MySQL table, there is a row labeled "state". There are 3 values possible for this. How could I utilise PHP to echo "Unbanned" as apposed to "0" in state? And "Banned" as apposed to "1" and "Temp-Banned" as apposed to "3"? How would I use php to display "UnBanned" instead of 0 in the MySQL? I am using a table for this. All help is incredibly appreciated :)
is there some missing code here that should go along with these Name objects? Persimmon has some methods that go along with these. Might be worth looking in to.
255 projects ! WOW ! well I can see that happening for what you do...
I assumed you didn't care about modifying the caller's array because "resources += srcs" modifies resources in-place as well. Yay Python. So you should fix that below. Also typically in Python we strongly discourage mutable default arugments.
commit.hashCode() should be sufficient. A commit can only have one author.
How on earth is it buggy?
I'm building a marketplace application that uses PayPal Express. I've got a form for sellers to input their PayPal API credentials, but I need a way to validate them by making some sort of call to PayPal. I'm using the PaypalExpressGateway in ActiveMerchant, and I don't see anything other than the standard purchase controls. Is there any sort of null-operation that can be used? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
don't confuse algorithm with implementation. env is not supposed to be used this way as it's touched from different places. it was said many times that using env to pass data between different codepaths is a bad idea.
I am planning to use community sever for one of our projects, i used it in the past but we had a lot of problems customizing it and understanding how things work, im affraid to get into that again, and i would like to add some things to it but i dont know how flexible it is.
I am trying to save a ListObject from a .NET 3.5 Excel 2007 VSTO Workbook to a new sheet (done) and save that new sheet to a new workbook (done) without that workbook requiring the VSTO customization file (!!!!!). Has anyone had any luck with this? The only way I've had any success is just saving as a CSV file but that's not exactly acceptable in this case. I'd rather not save to a CSV just to copy back to a XLS file. worksheet.SaveAs(saveDialog.FileName, Excel.XlFileFormat.xlOpenXMLWorkbook)
So, it is as simple as purchasing a domain name, and then adding that identifying information to the hosts file? If so, that is excellent!!
I've shortened to isIPv4, but I don't think preferIPv4 is correct. first(preferIPv4) seems reasonable, but partition(preferIPv4) doesn't actually prefer IPv4.
0 to jar hell.
This chipset needs to override the generic __smbus_read_byte().
Not sure why this one is confusing. It returns the list of files, so it has to be immediate, and it returns the files in that directory, not ones in sub directories.
I don't know that this will actually do what you want.
Holy hell I think I found one problem with turning a bignum into anything else.
I'd add a guard to prevent surprises if (db.isBare()) { return null; }
another note for future patch: replace static references by the proper Dao getter.
Patch Set 5: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve Rebased with current master Took comments into account. Using 4.3 in deprecation log as it is like that in config_default but using @deprecated with 4.6 and remove in 4.8 to stick to our rules.
Excellent questions! This particular project will need DS, WAYF, etc.
Am I doing something stupid here?
With what little I know, I'd recommend looking at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours (it uses Parsec etc.) but I'm not leaving it as an answer because it's quite possibly a terrible one. Hopefully someone who knows better will answer (and then I'll delete this comment).
I understand you do this so that GF_FREE() under the out: label does not free the acl_xattr. The dict_unref() will call GF_FREE() already. Is there a need for GF_FREE() in out: at all? I think that only is useful for the error case when dict_set_bin() failed. It would be cleaner, and easier to understand if you do the GF_FREE(acl_xattr) above in the 'if (ret)' statements. There is no need for this 'acl_xattr = NULL' then anymore. If you do not like that approach (or if I missed something that makes it impractical), this 'acl_xattr = NULL' stetment desperately needs a comment.
Excellent Thanks!
unrelated, but 'children and whose children' ain't english ;)
found a solution, would still love to see alternatives!
I have a new responsive site I'm building and the site's header renders just great in all browsers except Internet Explorer 9. This puzzles me because I thought IE9 was more standards compliant. If I put IE9 in IE8 compatibility mode, it again renders fine. Any insight would be extremely helpful! I'm really stumped and perhaps it's an easy fix. Site Address: IE 9 Screenshot: Chris H.
Now that I'm really looking at the code, would not the right fix be to change toknext to be signed instead of unsigned (so that the for loop stops immediately), or to check that it is > 0? if tokens = NULL, then parser->toknext will always be set to 0. That said, your change is somehow equivalent so we could keep it as-is.
i would suggest LG_MSG_INVALID_ARG instead in all the places
is this an optional call or clients should always call it at the end? when is it a good idea to call unmount? Can we add this info to some form of documentation?
When I refactor the following line: using Resharper's "Use Object Initializer", I get the following: I really hate this type of formatting because with longer object names and variables it just gets out of control. How can I get Resharper to do the following?
+1 Excellent explanation!
Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this Please fix the indent pep8 errors in gluster_cli_tests.py at least.
Prefer angle brackets for headers not provided by us.
No worries, Greg!
@StoneFree welcome to the future brave time traveller! :o)
Add spaces to relation name to match those in type definition
I'm not clear if "${workspace_loc:gitiles-parent}" mean "$WORKSPACE/gitiles-parent" or if it means "Path to the project named "gitiles-parent". When I changed the on-disk location (via the rename above) of my gitiles checkout (under my /src/workspaces directory) to /src/workspaces/gitiles-parent then I got to the next error. :)
great question, wondering it myself!
Thanks for taking a look Jiannan
@R.. Wow! Really great answer!! You should post it as an answer here, as it's really more precise. Just a question, though, when you say round for the alignment of the type, you mean that if for example on your example you had a short b instead of int b,
+1: I just used implemented this, it works great!
Done sorry for all the mess on a simple patch.
Sorry.
Put this into a DEPS variable and reuse the value above in gwt_module() too?
I don't know why the editor is giving me so much trouble. At first the code blocks wouldn't do anything but indent, so I had to change it to pre tags. Then my carefully numbered sequence is now all 1s. This thing is making me look ridiculous!
If someone wants to take this over that's cool - I'm unlikely to have time in the next week and a half though.
I swear I read somewhere on Smashing magazine along time ago that all pseudo selectors are less performant but I can't find such an article. I can only find these 2 references (not sure of there credibility): * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4082077/first-child-is-too-slow-alternatives/4082105#4082105 * http://www.onextrapixel.com/2012/05/03/css-tricks-how-to-speed-up-css-rendering/ I think the main thing I would say is whilst integrating with VE we should avoid them where possible. Use of first-child might invite us to use last-child and other selectors based on the idea. I do think we should be avoid nth-of-type and nth-child at all costs but I'd expect first-child and last-child to be less evil! That said browsers are getting better and better these days and we could just make the decision that we will use them and wait for browsers and VE to catch up. As tech lead, let me know what approach you want us to take. Happy either way. Please can we get the outcome documented on the coding guidelines page?
If this place is fixed to contain fd->flags, should the other places(anon fd) also be fixed to use fd->flags?
I am completely hopeless with regular expressions... I have a Velocimacro named , and I have a JS function named . Now I want to find all the places the JS function is called. So I need to search for "addButton", where "addButton" doesn't start with the hash key. Any ideas?
This is a horrible solution. It will silently fail for floats. It also lacks parentheses.
There's an RFC for how to read RFCs. Love it!
Use Web Essentials... it works really great, and has lots of other useful tidbits!
+1 for the `/* God I hate Microsoft! */` comment in the IE7 stylesheet.
(I could not get what KEYWORD means.)
If this line is removed the rDescription parameter name (and only the name) needs to be commented out because otherwise in an --enable-werror build the build breaks with "unused variable".
Pull it back in if you think different.
put your path and your shadow in a set. apply your animation to the set and it'll affect both. a really terrible example where I move both at once.
You should be able to add the attribute during OnPreRender(). INamingContainer is so painful sometimes...
I have a function: Basically it just uses the plugin to nudge an image on mouseover to one slide and then another, to give the effect of a shake. I can see my code looks absolutely horrible, (I come from a php/c# background) can anoyone suggest a better means to achieve my goal?
Sorry - the above comes across as terse.
This || breaks -e. If you need this information you need to reimplement -e yourself. if ! go build -a std; then failed=true if $sete; then exit 1 fi fi
Still printed but had that dreaded extra page! -_-
You can't make changes directly to OOJS directly here. You need to check out the oojs repos (gerrit.wikimedia.org:29418/oojs/core.git & gerrit.wikimedia.org:29418/oojs/ui.gt), make changes there, and once they are merged create a separate change which updates this concatenated file. Then you can rebase onto that change.
follow up? hate all this stuff getting bikeshed for weeks for that sort of thing. can you also check out 6465, 6463.
I suggest to add a wrapper class like \F3\FLOW3\Persistence\ObjectStorage and keep the API attach() and detach() stable.
Hey I just had to solve this on a project I am working on, here is my answer Then in my configuration (I am using Fluent NHibernate to configure my unit tests in code) AWESOMENESSSSSSSS!
Excellent - thanks !
I understand not liking XAML, as it really intimidated me at first, but I will quickly say that it is a powerful tool. I am not sure how to do it through the designer, but in C# let's say you name your DataGrid 'myDataGrid' and your List is named 'stringList'. It is as simple as the following: and the data grid is now bound to your string list.
that's what I thought, that's why I'm surprised
This was my bad.
Aaarrggh how stupid of mine to have a System.out again!
The doc comments are inheritted from the parent class(es)
Sorry for the missing class src/java/org/apache/jdo/tck/lifecycle/StateTransitionsReturnedObjects.java.
My point is that let's maintain our own configs even fi they are the same as the default ones, and change them soon by considering various factors including perf results.
This is an absolutely horrid wart in the API, but it's never going away.
You should . It has a lot of good packages. I found these packages to help you with zip files for example: The NPM registry is really amazing :)
Logger on top of Log4J and its abstract base class for supporting other frameworks.
Please remove this log, it's a part of the if below
It is possible to kept alcatel-lucent.xylan (and remove the other) Xylan has buy by Alcatel in 1999... (if i remember..)
Still have a question: why do you add changes for software_config and software_deployment tables here? As far I understand they were fixed in previous patch for both tables.
I did not suggest that the acquire/release functions would be called globally for all NI. I said "each time an interface that needs the acceptor". If the interface doesn't use the acceptor don't call acquire at startup, and don't call release at shutdown. I don't much care about the length of the list or the time involved. I am looking for code that is more easy to read and maintain.
excellent alternative!
Excellent thanks!
I have a long scrolling page, and want to test if an element is 100px from the top, then apply a class elsewhere (until the next element in line is 100px from the top) If I could just get the basic statement I would be ecstatic, anything extra would be a bonus!
The patch looks good.
This code works absolutely fine!
Sorry ;-) +1
you handle all these exceptions in the same way so you can use multi-catch: } catch (RevisionSyntaxException | AmbiguousObjectException | IncorrectObjectTypeException | IOException e) {
It is really sad that answers need to be more than three characters
Thanks Arvind
Ahh, I see. :) I'm not seeing an isEmpty() method for the Cursor class. Should I check for moveToFirst == false instead? Also, while I'm on this, is there a reason we call the CursorLoader parameter CursorLoaderLoader and the Cursor parameter cursorLoader? Can I change them to just cursorLoader and cursor?
Thanks again for this really great patch Andrew.
It looks like this allows a user who cannot see all branches to probe which branches exist. By looking at the error message "it doesn't exist" vs. "user does not have rights to delete it." a user can detect if a branch that is not visible to him exists.
Yes they are. Most of the shorter methods are from Media Foundation SDK example.
You are processing the newline character as if it is legitimate input. You should either read the entire line (including the newline, perhaps using a ) and then process the first character of the line or simply add a test to skip newlines in your loop logic.P.S. Converting case by adding or subtracting 32 is a really awful approach. It won't work with anything but a-z and A-Z (in the English alphabet). It won't work for most characters outside the Basic Latin block and shouldn't be used at all for characters that have no alternate case (such as newline). You should be using and instead.
Sorry misunderstood the issue!
I think should this be translated(m_xOffset, m_yOffset) instead, because adjusted(x1,y1,x2,y2) will make the rectangle grow
Ahh yes. OK. ROMCC and all that. I forgot about that jazz. On further thought w.r.t. the naming. It should really be pcidev_t, no? That would be typedef'd to unsigned int *and* used in struct pci_path? That name would be clearer. Or are we doing to try and encode all different types of devices into a simple_device_t?
Excellent thanks!
Wow - excellent! How did you find this age old question? :)
Gav...(Hoping I'm not teaching you how to suck eggs :) )
Thanks for spotting this fixed at r487519
I've used Clojure, it's great for an ex-Lisper! I may do it opposite from you and learn Haskell next.
We take an "error_list" from the framework here, but "message" is passed as an argument. Looking at how message is constructed, this also could be generated here (there is no need to pass it through argument). So either both message and error_list are this function arguments, or none of them.
Just a personal opinion, not an actual answer but... I love those login forms (not pages) which just shows up in the center of the page and after you type in your username and password you are logged in without ever leaving the current page!
Aha thanks for the information. That makes sense. Glad to hear that it helped! :)
I appreciate your warm welcome, I never seen such a warm regard here for trying to be helpful, it was a really pleasant introduction and I want to thank you for taking your time to write - at last the end of the questions reads "If anyone has any ideas I would be extremely grateful!"
Hasn't made a difference I'm afraid :(
