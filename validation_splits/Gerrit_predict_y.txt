"with the transition to ORM all we should care of is the real identifiers of this class, which is id" â ” that's considered to be not true. Since we(at least I don't) do not know (yet?), which operations will be performed on entities, we cannot tell, what we have to compare. Namely, we have to know first, whether these entities will be processed also with unset id when stored in collections, if so, then comparing just ids spells crazy results. Usually it's recommended to compare some unique business id instead of or along with db ID. See Hibernate recommendation related to id generation / object identity. Ok, I'll regenerate equals&hashcode using these two fields.

Add: When you copy a manifest object, the new object is a "normal" object -- not a copy of the manifest. Instead it is a concatenation of all the segment objects.

Conversion was done for binary files to be stored in earlier formats. Encountering such versions isn't the case anymore with copy&paste and conversion would never be executed, so that code could be removed along with the check. If you want you can remove that code in a follow-up patch, getting rid of unused code is always good :-) Probably the reason why you had to add the check if a version is set at all is related to that, actually the stream should have the version SOFFICE_FILEFORMAT_CURRENT set so all parts involved elsewhere that do check the version get that correct. Would be nice if you could spot the place where that should be done. Anyhow, I'll push the current patch as is.

FYI this probably doesn't always work. Booleans are stored as CHAR(1) with value Y for true and N for false. Not every JDBC driver out is going to grok this as a boolean value. It would be safer to use "Y".equals(rs.getString()) in code such as this. Can't this statement also be written as an UPDATE: UPDATE accounts SET reverse_patch_set_order   'Y' WHERE display_patch_sets_in_reverse_order   'Y'; UPDATE accounts SET show_username_in_review_category   'Y' WHERE display_person_name_in_review_category   'Y'; This should be much faster to process, and every SQL server we support will grok those two small statements.

Here, we are making a bunch of datastore calls in a loop, which could fail (or time out) and drop half of the updates. Since this is derived data and an async update is probably okay, a more robust approach would be to put tasks on the App Engine task queue to refresh each graph. Failed tasks automatically get retried. The most robust way to do the update: given a graph id, regenerate the graph from a query of all its dependencies, sort of like a makefile. Then, since it's idempotent, it doesn't matter if it fails sometimes, and we can ignore concurrency as well since multiple writes don't matter. (Incremental updates would be more efficient but trickier to get right, so I typically put that off until it seems necessary.)

Hi Nigel, To expand on what Tobias said, when you change the content of a language string you also need to change its name. Otherwise the Launchpad translation site isn't smart enough to tell translators that they need to update it. See https://wiki.mahara.org/index.php/Developer_Area/Language_strings#Let_translators_know_when_lang_strings_change So please change the string name to "editaccesspagedescription4". You'll also need to change the name of the string in the PHP files and templates where it is used. Sorry about that!

I don't think the comparison with the SshCommands (or RestViews) is fair. For SSH commands we have a simple lookup by command name and it is all that matters.

I remember seeing error like "Lproc: Attempting to register osc more than once" when trying to mount lustre file system on server node. Looks like we have this logic to avoid re-creating osc proc entry in osp_mod_init but its counterpart is missing in osc_setup(). So if we have osp loaded before osc, we get the failure inserting osc module. The error now gets hidden with this patch because lprocfs_seq_register() only warns about it and creates duplicated entry in parent's subdir link. Then subsequent lookup only finds the newly created entry and it can cause random failures.

I started replacing C0 with c[0] because I didn't see a significant advantage of having C0 available. But then I saw this and realized this AI naming is used in some other places.

I swear I read somewhere on Smashing magazine along time ago that all pseudo selectors are less performant but I can't find such an article. I can only find these 2 references (not sure of there credibility): * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4082077/first-child-is-too-slow-alternatives/4082105#4082105 * http://www.onextrapixel.com/2012/05/03/css-tricks-how-to-speed-up-css-rendering/ I think the main thing I would say is whilst integrating with VE we should avoid them where possible. Use of first-child might invite us to use last-child and other selectors based on the idea. I do think we should be avoid nth-of-type and nth-child at all costs but I'd expect first-child and last-child to be less evil!

I think that this class makes more sense than the Branch class because there are several places in Gerrit where refs strings are manipulated without using Branch objects. Jgit does define some of those constants, but we cannot use jgit everywhere, particularly in GWT, which I suspect is why this class is here in the first place. We need a good place in Gerrit for these constants, and the Branch object itself is a much higher level object than this simple class (it isn't only about refs, but rather refs and projects). These constants feel more appropriate here to me than in the Branch class. I have some more changes, which I will push, which move them out of the Branch class completely. I am willing to update the comment here if need be, but this class feels appropriate to me (based on its name and location) and I don't think that "naive" comment should get in the way of that.

I thought a little about this. Basically it should work like this: ImageName is null: there's no friendly name for the image, use the ImageId to list/display the image. ImageName is not null: there's a friendly name specified for the image but since it can be duplicated (it's not guaranteed to be unique), then we should also give an hint about which image it is (at the moment that's done reporting the initial part of ImageId, just as git does with short hashes). Now considering this last case if we set ImageName   ImageId, then the displayed name would be something like "myisoimagename.iso (myisoim)". Please let me know if you have a better idea on how to handle this all. Anyway (beside the image name displaying) I think that the safest way to address this now is not to set an ImageName since in fact there's not an additional friendly name to set.

I understand you do this so that GF_FREE() under the out: label does not free the acl_xattr. The dict_unref() will call GF_FREE() already. Is there a need for GF_FREE() in out: at all?

Is this the right API? An alternative is: func If(s RuneSet, tTrue, tFalse Transformer) Transformer type RuneSet interface { Contains(rune) bool } and have unicode.RangeTable implement this interface. If performance is a concern, the If function could do a type assertion to see if s is a *unicode.RangeTable, and switch to an optimized implementation, the same way that the image/draw package does in the stdlib. But I'm not sure if we even want a Ranges or If. The point of the Transformer interface is to transform things in bulk. If you're going to be chopping between two separate transformers depending on the input runes, then it seems like you're not getting the benefit of transforming in bulk. Instead, I'd just loop over the input and append to a []byte. It's not like you have some input that contains both Code Page 437 and Shift-JIS and you want to switch between them.

OK, thanks. The approach here and in my patch work fine if the user controls everything they way they want. When auto-detecting everything, this patch is better on non-AVX hardware that happens to have RDTSCP. Otherwise, they effectively work the same. When compiling on a new build host for old compute nodes, this patch will sometimes require the user to make two active settings to make a functional mdrun. That might mean they go hunting for docs twice, unless they find the new install guide section. At least we don't fail mysteriously any more! When compiling on an old build host for new compute nodes, both patches will sometimes make an mdrun that could be better in up to two ways. We could add a nag message for the double negation of the new code in gmx_detect_hardware.c "You, too, could be using RDTSCP!". AFAIK the proposition that using RDTSCP is good in user space is just educated guesswork, though.

On HTTP /abandon and /restore accept no body. This results in null being passed to the apply() method, which handles it gracefully by creating an empty input. I think its common to call /abandon and /restore with no input. Your tests are certainly showing that. Perhaps we should overload abandon() and restore() methods to also have a no-arg form that passes null to apply the same way the HTTP interface does when the client doesn't supply a body.

On second sought: actually you don't need this file (endpoint) at all. We have already POST /changes that creates a change and what are you doing here is to delegate to its apply() method, after translating your own Input to ChangeInfo. The only reason to have this class is to get the UiAction for granted (Guice DynamicItem binding and discovery). But you could solve this in different way: just construct UiAction on you own in ProjectJson and add it to actions map manually. See an example how it's done in InlineEdit series: [1]. Now, on the client side, from your custom UiAction you can invoke the original REST endpoint: POST /changes. The only difference to current solution: you would need to pass project name too, obviously. This also raises the question do we want to have this button on project info screen at all? We could add it to main page (or may be just add a keyboard shortcut), in wich case we are not in project context any more and the dialog must be extended to provide project name (with suggestion oracle for project, like it already does for branches). I don't have strong preference for one of these solutions. So, you can let it as is for now and wait for opinion of other reveiwers.

Patch Set 1: Thanks for your reviews. To be honest, it would be nice, if you could be a bit more friendly to - not first time in case of Thomas, but occasional - contributors. IMHO one or two -1 are enough for the beginning. Bjrn and Philipp, you're really helpful contributors, thanks for that. We were discussing the "patch for a patch rule" over the last days, which we enjoined on ourselves as core team members some time ago (and it works in at least most of the cases I think).

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this (2 inline comments) I don't see the need for this change. If you built with the ebuild unmodified, you'd get an image.bin which would be what you want. As far as I could tell looking at the new function, it's identical to the old one except that you're leaving out the original image.bin. The difference between image.bin and image.rw.bin is that cros_bundle_firmware is being passed the --force-rw option in one case and not in the other. What that does is it changes the way parts of the image are put together so that vboot doesn't allow the RO only optimization even if the RO firmware claims it supports it. The RO only optimization is where you run the whole firmware out of RO instead of jumping into an RW copy partway through. If you really don't want to enable that optimization, you can not pass that flag to vboot when running VbInit. Even if you do want to split things out like this, it would be better to take the existing depthcharge function and to selectively build the RO image based on a use flag. Independent of whether splitting things up is a good idea, if Mike (who knows bash much better than I do, I think) likes the style of the new function you've made, it would be nice to incorporate the style changes back into the original function.

Patch Set 4: Although already merged, I don't think this is the right solution. Currently the behavior of the permissions system (TCEmain and thus also all other components) is to use "checkLanguageAccess" only if the TCA for the table has a "languageField". "pages" is not such a table, because there is "pages_language_overlay". So the current integrators solution to restrict a user not to be able to edit the "Original Language" is to remove the permissions for editing table "pages" and only allow "pages_language_overlay". See also http://forge.typo3.org/issues/27794 This is not what is being done in the patch, but instead you simply check for checkLanguageAccess. Similar problem we have in the "List view", as the context menu provides more options (i.e. for content elements) than really permitted. Permission check in TCEmain is more "aggressive" than in the GUI. Correct solution for this particular fix would be to check if user has "edit permissions" on the "pages" table - just like TCEmain also does. As this is confusing for integrators in general, I would rather propose that someone thinks about a better approach on "language restriction permissions on pages" in the first place before fixing the GUI.

I am maintainer and have power of -2. I review a change and decide to put my veto on it. But we all do mistakes, we all have feelings? In the end we are all people. What is if it was a wrong veto?

That was actually the original code. If dest    src and you're only copying one byte at a time, if you start from the top you'll never overwrite the data you haven't copied yet. Otherwise, you have to start from the other end. *dest     *src memcpy;, but memcpy is not *dest     *src;. To quote from the pretty short man page: The memory areas must not overlap. That's the difference between memcpy and memmove. If there was no overlap at all (which we could check for) then you could use memcpy, and that would make the normal case work like it always has. But I'm working on a change to add optimized versions of memmove for x86 and ARM. In order to test them I'm going to implement them in the chromeos tree, and then to transfer them over I've put together a big series of patches to upstream so they should just apply.

That's a bit of a philosophical discussion. I thought about it earlier, but the reason for limiting the range is that we only use the single precision range in the SIMD parts of Gromacs - since all algorithms in particular need to work if the user has set the precision to single - we only use double to improve precision, not range. One _could_ of course add double precision range tests, but then the next obvious question is why we allow routines to provide incorrect results for NaN,  -infinity, negative zero, etc?

This is more obvious in this file than the other. You should be escaping the periods in your regular expressions. I know that it will match the period in the URL anyway, but we want it to *only* match the period. Also, you should use specific matches for scid, height and width, rather than the period (match anything).

We would prefer to keep this.

When you move a host to maintenance then that calls disconnectStorageServer which should remove this definition so in general this shouldn't affect anything negatively. The case where this would remain is in case of an error flow where for some reason it wasn't disconnected properly or something. Even if that happens, it's not that interesting as a few leftover connections shouldn't affect the host negatively (think about FC where the host is always connected). The advantage is that most of the time (since hosts don't move between DCs very often) the host would automatically reconnect whenever it reboots (e.g. due to sanlock fencing) and it would be available to engine almost immediately reducing recovery time. Imo that is more important.

Yeah, I used that in other places. You're right it doesn't make much of a difference: no difference for norm and about 20% or 20k for the language tables.

Yes, it is a bug in adb, no ambiguity here, but it's really subtle, so it'd be nice to have a better description of the problem, it's not really Python specific as you mention, i.e. something like: """ Some programs want to launch an adb command and collect its output by calling CreateProcess with inheritable stdout/stderr handles, then using read() to get its output. When this happens, the stdout/stderr handles passed to the adb client process will also be inheritable. When starting the adb server here, care must be taken to reset them to non-inheritable. Otherwise, something bad happens: even if the adb command completes, the calling process is stuck while read()-ing from the stdout/stderr descriptors, because they're connected to corresponding handles in the adb server process (even if the latter never uses/writes to them). """ The PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST isn't directly related to the problem, and not needed in this specific case because I don't think there are multiple threads being used in the adb client process (at least when reaching this code).

Yes. Actually, look at what I just merged to master with the query operators, in particular you might want to read the documentation in user-search.txt. You can write a query to identify changes that can be submitted: is:open CodeReview 2 Verified 1 -Verified-1 -CodeReview-2 If we put that string (minus the is:open part that would be implied) into your field, it means what you want it to mean... you can submit this only if the above expression is true. By making it a single string, all you need to do is feed the string from the table through the ChangeQueryBuilder to get a Predicate ChangeData , and then run match() on that to see if the submit is possible. That completely removes the FunctionState mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time.

Yikes, we are starting an RPC for every row in the table? My concern with this is the browser can only issue 4 requests at a time to the server.
