Thank you for the patch Sergey.
Igor sorry it took me so long to get back to this.
Hey sorry I did not get back to you sooner.
I found the (sad) attempt at a script you asked about and uploaded it to MAPREDUCE-4282.
Sorry for the delay.
I don't have resources to hand to test this at mo.
Yes it is a dup thanks Mike for taking care of this (I planned to do this yesterday but didn't make it)
Forgot to add that I also tried this with and without HBASE-5864
but app developers should always explicitly set it based on their application My guess is that a large enough group of people take the defaults that it matters.
App developers never do what they should :)
problem - the bit to sign the source-release is being called when the source-release isn't being built because the source-release is only built at the "executionroot".
Excuse me for stolen assignement.
In current version the same error cause different messages because there are many commiters.
Sorry for the missing class src/java/org/apache/jdo/tck/lifecycle/StateTransitionsReturnedObjects.java.
Sorry if this was not clear and yes by <blank> I meant an empty string.
Qianshi is working on the SSL session reuse but this buggy Bug system does not allow him assign this ticket sigh
Hi Guillaume I did not have an answer right away so I sent you question to Leonard Rosenthol.
Sorry should have commented on this much sooner.
It is not yet tested - I ran into strange build problems with APR.
Done sorry for all the mess on a simple patch.
Secondly reading this code I can see why this bug is happening after completing stage 2 above when adding the new item the code does "ordered - cancelled = quantity" which equates to "1 - 1 = 0".
Keep repeating this and the problem just gets worse.
Please ignore attachment (id=6938).
It was attached to the wrong bug.
(back from holidays so a bit delayed but) I confirm Andrzej's suggestion -- a plain-text only summarized is ideal for clustering for example.
HTML is quite uncomfortable to work with.
Hi Marco I changed the name of patch because it was made in Java earliar sorry for inconvenience.
Sorry for the mistake.
Not sure I want the transient inability to clean up some local log or other trivial task to kill a whole pig job?
First guess: something's getting confused about reversed-ness.
Sorry I took Martin's comment to mean the patch was committed and issue closed which certainly discarded all the patches the first time around.
I don't know what just happened.
The patch went to the wrong bug.
Sorry again!
Our caller may not notice what happend right now.
Sorry for my poor review didn't notice try/catch :(
It does not look very useful.
Oh I'm sorry I was unclear.
Sorry Jacques I'll upload another file.
I did it wrong this time.
Sorry I had attached an older version... let's try this one.
However I figured it was better to get it in the public domain sooner and let the iterative process do it's work.
This is only a problem with exceptions from java.
Incidentally if we all nag Joe Walnes enough we might be able to persuade him to release a new qdox which can ignore annotations etc (though it will still struggle with generics I think)
Sorry I kind of forget about this one.
I don't have strong opinions about it either way.
Bugs like this make me sad.
SnappyCodec check for Hadoop native lib is wrong.
Sorry for the delay I'm recreating the mirror now.
Brandon sorry.
I misread.
Ignore comment.
Seems to be a faulty mailserver setup at laguna-industries.com.
Unfortunately in these days where everyone that can put a CD the right way up in a drive is a Linux/Unix/Windows/Internet Expert this has become pretty common.
And with a network that tolerates almost everything to get a mail somehow in the right place it is only seldom noticed (or when it is it is blamed on Microsoft.
Mac looks like the tests are failing (especially TestHarFileSystem).
Luke Sorry for the late attaching latest version patch
RMAppAttemptImpl.recoverAppAttemptTokens() Looks like all changes in RMAppImpl are unnecessary.
Bug in existing testDelegationTokenRestoredOnRMrestart().
Sorry we are no longer using Xerces.
That is a bit too lax I think.
The cause is that the call to SpecificResponder.writeError in Responder.respond ultimately calls GenericData.resolveUnion which in turn calls GenericData.getSchemaName before the line where the UnresolvedUnionException gets thrown.
I am new to Mina and the whole environment.
I have this issue where my server and client is creating a lot of loopback threads that I believe must be related to this issue.
