I've been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model, builds and outputs a view. I think this is mainly wrong. The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model, select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model, surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.

You need to the file name as you build your URL. This will escape the '#' character, allowing the browser to interpret it appropriately. Proper encoding is very important for preventing attacks against your application, which can be devastating.
Why do you not want to store it in the assets folder? That's what it's for. Regardless, you can't reference your local hard drive for it.

Just get a reference to your TypeFace as a , depending on where you are saving them (e.g. ) and use .

What you are implementing here is very similar to a . Doing it by hand is the only way I'm afraid! My advice is to use in your class A definition and override the properties for your class B implementation: Functionally, this will act similarly.

You have two divs, one over the other, and the one on top is transparent. However, when you scroll you want the div on the bottom to hide as it goes under the first transparent div. You don't want the second div's to change to as soon as it goes under the first div. You just want the part that is under to be hidden. I've googled extensively for an answer: #1-4 answer make the div on top or . The problem with this for me is my background is a photograph, i.e. as you scroll down what you see is different, as opposed to a colour or a pattern. The "background" of the transparent div needs to change as the real background changes. #5 offers a solution to this using JQuery however there are horrible, horrible issues with scroll lag in browsers not Firefox. Folks, how do I do it?

I would suggest you always take a normalized approach to your database schema and then later decided if you need to create a solution for performance reasons. Premature optimization can be dangerous. Premature database de-normalization can be disastrous! I would suggest that you stick with the original schema and later, if necessary, create a reporting table that is a de-normalized version of your normalized schema.
Combining NH attributes and some FNH automapping stuff looks very scary. I do not understand it at all but IMO classic ClassMap is much more transparent. You must pay with more key strokes but your head hurts less:). and this code deletes connection and endpoint as well from database:

is not an , it's a basic type. You can only add NSObject-derived objects to an NSArray. The EXC_BAD_ACCESS is probably because, under the covers, it's trying to access an object stored at wherever your int is pointing to. In other words, it's using your int as a pointer to an NSObject and failing horribly when it does so.

Hey Piper, I saw you posting a lot of `git` questions tonight (which is completely fine!) but just wanted to make sure you were aware of http://gitready.com and the Git Community Book: http://book.git-scm.com/ which might help you with some of your questions. The community book even has some screencasts in it. Again, feel free to ask questions here... just wanted to pass that along to you.

The answer does not establish the same 's as adding directly to the ajax call. So in order for jQuery to do this properly I add this : where is a global variable.

To get it to work in Internet Explorer I had to use following code:
I've searched this and cannot find it. I've tried different plugins and different browsers (Firefox, Opera, and Chrome). I've tried most of the no flash plugins for each of those as well as disabling Flash plugins/addons in the settings. I also renamed the file in i found by searching the system. when i renamed it, makes Firefox and Chrome ask to install Flash, but still: returns: I'm not sure what else to try without uninstalling Flash, but that will be a total pain in the ass for this. I also REALLY don't want to use SWFObject just to see if Flash is at all installed which I can do simply with: Any ideas?
I am trying to generate API documentation via cabal and haddock. I want it to be latex. So I do: This fails ultimately with: Is there something I can do or is something wrong with haddock?

@sjdowling when downvoting someone you are suggested to explain why...
When you call "su" you're creating a new process that runs that command, so after running exec("su") you have a new process with SU rights. You can't give your already running application SU rights I'm afraid! I'm not sure how other applications do this, but you can run "su -l ls /data" and then read from the outputstream of the process.
excellent, thanks!
@BrodieG, but together, we are infinite bliss. Didn't you feel that already? :-)
One non-technical consideration. Embedding free data inside English phrases isn't going to look very smooth in many cultures (including Western ones), where you need grammatical agreement on e.g. number, gender or case. A more telegraphic style usually helps (e.g. Excellent input: "xyz") -- then at least everybody gets the same level of clunkiness!
This is an exact repost of a previous question.

I'd recommend python as a fantastic general-purpose scripting language which is fairly quick to pick up. You'll find it's more versatile for system-programming than something like php, which would be another option. You might look here as a starting point: Besides, if you learn python, you can then learn django, which is incredibly awesome!

I'm absolutely loving BreezeJS and was so surprised to see that my Enum values were being displayed as their text values and not their ordinal ones! What I would love to be able to do is, on the client side, open the MetadataStore, fetch the enumeration and modify it's textual properties for display purposes. Is this currently possible? From my research it would appear not, but I'm wondering if there is perhaps a simple workaround. Everything I've tried has involved a large number of hacks and server-side attributes, but to no avail, or the solution just seemed overly complex and not worth the benefits.

PermGen memory can be garbage collected by full collections, so increasing it may increase the amount of GC time when a full collection takes place. These collections shouldn't take place too often though, and would typically still take less than a second to full GC 1GB of permgen memory - I'm just pulling this number from (my somewhat hazy) memory, so if you are really worried about GC times to some timing tests yourself (use and read the logs, more details )

I have a somewhat complicated issue. I have a grid defined (using the Struts2-JQuery Grid Plugin). One of the columns has a custom formatter that calls a Javascript function to put a button into that column. (Note: I absolutely HATE doing it that way). The point of the button is to open up a dialog box. This dialog box contains a checkboxlist, which can't be rendered in the grid. Somehow, I need to pass a parameter to the action that returns the view that will be displayed inside the dialog. Since this is somewhat complex, here is the code: Grid definition: Javascript Custom Formatter: Dialog Definition: Remote Manage Roles JSP (trimmed): Since I get the id of the grid object via javascript, but use the JSP taglib for the dialog, how can I pass the id around?

Having had some experience with using a thick client through VPN, I'd say go with some kind of web app. If done wrong, a thick client can become really painful to use through a VPN because of data churning. A web app concentrates all of that on the server, which makes it much better from that point of view. Other benefits: no deployment hassle no direct access to the database from the user machine. Evidently it also depends on your skills, and on how much time/budget you have...

I have an application where I need to adjust view position according to current focused subview (it's a list with focusable items, current focused item must be in the center of the screen - used for a tv application controlled from tv remote). Position must be adjusted with animation. I got it working with just one problem: if the user changes focus before the animation is complete (quickly taps "up" button twice) next animation starts with "jump" - it starts from the same position as did the first one. So what I try to do is I cancel previous animation and start another, but then new animation starts from the point where first animation was started, so user can see a very obvious jumps in the animation, which look really awful. Here's the code: So must question is: how can I start translate animation from the point where previous translate animation left on (assuming that it was cancelled)? Or, in a simplier words, how can I determine current visible rect of a view?

Android apps are constrained to a certain amount of memory. As it's quite (insanely?) low, I think you shouldn't feel guilty about using all of it! The limit is 16 MB on very old devices, 24 MB or 32 MB on newer ones. There doesn't seem to be much info on the size for different devices, and nobody seems to know why the limit is so small when modern phones have 1-2 GB of RAM. Aha, I found some concrete numbers on the limit: G1: 16MB Droid: 24MB Nexus One: 32MB Xoom: 48MB

Voting to close, the question I linked back to should have everything you need.
One potentially valid reason to impose some maximum password length is that the process of hashing it (due to the use of a slow hashing function such as bcrypt) takes up too much time; something that could be abused in order to execute a DOS attack against the server. Then again, servers should be configured to automatically drop request handlers that take too long. So I doubt this would be much of a problem.

Show us how far you have got - we aren't going to write it for you. Do you want to do it with DOM, SAX or other? Which have you tried so far? Which tutorials/documentation have you looked at?
It is interesting that you estimate that you will be able to reimplement features on your own that took years of specialists to implement. Wow!
I completely agree with you on that subject. In practice I think TDD often has some very negative effects on the code base (crappy design, procedural code, no encapsulation, production code littered with test code, interfaces everywhere, hard to refactor production code because everything is tightly coupled to many tests etc.). has given talks on exactly this topic for a while now: Recent studies (Siniaalto and Abrahamsson) of TDD show that it may have no benefits over traditional test-last development and that in some cases has deteriorated the code and that it has other alarming (their word) effects. The one that worries me the most is that it deteriorates the architecture. -- There is also a between Robert C. Martin and James Coplien where they touch on this subject.
How do you configure tomcat to bind to a single ip address (localhost) instead of all addresses?
+1 for excellent knowledge and many thanks
I usualy send all mine to /dev/null that way I don't ever have to worry about it. I have known some people who set it to /bin/logout so that when someone logged in they were logged back out.
I'm afraid you're either reading Steve Sounders' post wrong, or typing it wrong. Steve's findings are that his Squid proxy didn't cache the querystring URL - which is the exact opposite of "require filename changes in order to break the cache".
+1 for actually *answering* the question.
+1: Serialization can be a pain. This really helped me out.
Thanks--good answers. This is, in fact, a DateTime type; I had to typecast "stoptime" as: Minor point. It works great!
I would use pure ruby (Matz Ruby Interpreter (MRI)) to start off. My understanding is that iron ruby is not quite ready yet. If you are looking for a good book my current favorite (over pickaxe) is by matz and flanagan, the book is very concise well written paragraphs and they provide great examples (in 1.8.* and 1.9) Enjoy! :D
Use java dom api or sax for xml parsing. Give more concrete xml structure.
Wow, you are right, thanks! I'll accept Brians' answer.
A database is meant to manage large volumes of data, and are supposed to give you fast access to read and write that data in spite of the size. Put simply, they manage scale for data - scale that you don't want to deal with. If you have only a few users (hundreds?), you could just as easily manage the data on disk (say XML?) and keep the data in memory. The images should clearly not go in to the database so the question is how much data, or for how many users are you maintaining this database instance?
instanceof is very efficient, so your performance is unlikely to suffer. However, using lots of instanceof suggests a design issue. If you can use xClass == String.class, this is faster. Note: you don't need instanceof for final classes.
Source control, keep it offsite and keep it for life! You'll never have to worry about it.
I recommend you take a look at how merlin does it, as suggested by Erik Allik, e.g. https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin/blob/master/emacs/merlin.el#L430 starts a process, and https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin/blob/master/emacs/merlin.el#L631 sends a command to the ocaml merlin process, with an async handler.
Mike, totally agree. I really like the idea of Silverlight, its ties with Visual Studio are really awesome, but it has quite a way to go before it is mature enough for primetime use.
Well on the PC you can use MS Visio to produce a DB Entity diagram. It will even reverse engineer one from an existing Database. A pain to set-up the first time you use it, but quite handy thereafter.
@David, apologies - but at least one of them made sense (I hope!) :-)
I use and to embed the code formatting portions. Works great for me! :-) Sample page:
Carom3D is a great one, they seem to have mastered the physics. See these links for more info: Good luck!
Why not Double.TryParse ?
I have a situation where IE7 hangs accessing my web app. Based on the excellent from , I installed WinDbg to download the IE symbols, setup Process Explorer to use those symbols, and then used Process Explorer to get a stack trace for the hung thread. I have pasted the stack trace below. Does someone more familiar with the IE internals have an idea of what is happening, or a suggestion on how to progress with this?
Good Morning, I'm using SharePoint Designer 2007 to create a workflow for a MOSS site I have created. What I'm looking to do is have the workflow send out an email if a document in the library hasn't been modified for the past 30 days (and it's Status field is not set as "Closed"), but I'm stumped as to how I can do this. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
What are some effective strategies for preventing the use of my proprietary images? I'm talking about saving them, direct linking to them etc... Presently I have a watermark on the image, but I'd rather not. .NET platform preferred, but if there's a strategy that's on another platform that integrates with my existing application that'd be a bonus.
This whole DB is almost entirely read only so I'm not too worried about it changing.
has a good website intro to sql. If anyone wants a book, the first several chapters of book are an excellent intro. Much better than the text book from my database class. If anyone wants to explore relational database concepts, seems to have a good intro. book is also very good on that subject.
Check out It does the "THIS IS NOT A FUNCTIONAL APP" napkin view very well and is easy to use. Has a full featured you can try out online and as an added bonus you can email your XML to your client and they can tweak it and play with it and email it back to you without having to have a license.
I've used BeautifulSoup for such things in the past with great success.
I love you dude ! :) Saved me a lot of time.
Perhaps pipe the users through Google's Web Transcoder - http://google.com/gwt/n then you don't have to worry about the WML conversion, as google will translate your page into WML.
Wow! Awesome responses - I'll have to try'em out after work today, and I'll let y'all know how it goes :)
