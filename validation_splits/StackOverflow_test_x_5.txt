If you are concerned about code re-ordering you are either creating some funky and hard to understand and maintain code, or else you probably don't need to worry about it. Can you explain why you think the code snippet you supplied will be reordered?
Since you're testing legacy code I'm assuming you can't refactor said code to have less dependencies (e.g. by using the ) That leaves you with little options I'm afraid. Every header that was included for a type or function will need a mock object for that type or function for everything to compile, there's little you can do...
Herbert's answer is a suggested way of marginally automating the browser to check the boxes and click the delete button. If one was to setup a browser automation project with Selenium or such, then this would be a legitmate but painfully slow solution to delete all entities via the admin screen as it only deletes at most 20 entities at a time.
I hate to say it, but constant polling over HTTP is the poor mans solution.
I don't want to do anything fancy on Twitter except post to it via my site once a day. I have searched around a bit and there are all sorts of super-complex ways to do every little thing that Twitter does, but there seems to be little documentation on how to do the simplest thing, which is make a post! Does anyone know how to do this? Or can you at least point me in the right direction? I don't need full wrappers or anything (), just one simple function that will post to Twitter. Thanks!
I'm apologize for saying this, but the code you've posted is simply awful and needs desperate refactoring. Create a class to represent 7 properties instead of 7 parallel arraylists, and use String.split to parse a comma-seperated list.
Is there any way to have a statement across multiple lines without the underscore character? It is really annoying in multi-line strings such as SQL statements, and especially LINQ queries. Beside from the ugliness and difficulty when changing a line (nothing lines up anymore) you can't use comments in the middle of the multi-line statement. Examples of my daily personal hell.
unfortunatly most browsers think window.close() is malicious and don't allow it to close itself without at least prompting the user :(
such a strong argument without any "reference", is completely useless because just opinionated.
I am about to alter the several tables in a massive system which I probably only understand around 10%. I want to add three columns. One of these is just a rename of an existing column. Part of me wants to :- Rename the column but worried about the impact on unknown parts of the system that use the old name. Append the three columns to the table therefore making the old column redundant (over time).
That's what I was thinking, but I am afraid it will bring confusion to the structure. I will need to add "Set children" field to parent class which should not be used anywhere in the code, only for hibernate cascade deletion. Do you think it is ok?
Can somebody point me to a resource that explains how to go about having 2+ IIS web server clustered (or Webfarm not sure what its called) ? All I need is something basic, an overview how and where to start. Can't seem to find anything...
Eruby is an external executable, while erb is a library within Ruby. You would use the former if you wanted independent processing of your template files (e.g. quick-and-dirty PHP replacement), and the latter if you needed to process them within the context of some other Ruby script. It is more common to use ERB simply because it is more flexible, but I'll admit that I have been guilty of dabbling in eruby to execute files for quick little utility websites.
So for my text parsing in C# , I got directed at YAML. I'm hitting a wall with this library I was recommended, so this is a quickie. And so on. Is that valid?
iâll try this. string needs to be iterable. and while we are at it: how come java is so damn awful? no sane person would specify `remove` in an interface, just to add `throws UnsupportedOperationException - if the remove operation is not supported by this Iterator`.
My guess would be from a colleague who wanted to scare this person out of ever using 'this' again. It can be fairly annoying when someone uses 'this' for every single thing they do. Not that it justifies lying to a new programmer, but I can imagine someone doing this out of frustration.
old question, but if anyone finds this through google (as I did) and who does not want to use anchors or jquery; there's a builtin javascriptfunction to 'jump' to an element; and what's even better; according to the great compatibility-tables on quirksmode, this is !
You shouldn't worry about regular expression optimization. The call to os.system('uptime') you seem to use takes about 1000 times longer than the call to re.findall. http://hans.gerwitz.com/2004/08/12/premature-optimization-is-the-root-of-all-evil.html
Whatever you do, make sure that you don't use Apache's DBCP. It's a horrible implementation that will actually cause performance problems, not fix them.
Don't forget this excellent devnet article meant for transitioning from AS2 to AS3:
+1 This is the most accurate answer - ASP.NET and .NET 4.0 are supported in 2008 R2 SP1. It's not painless but all the necessary parts are in the links above. There is an excellent installation guide at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753802.
Congratulations!
I agree with @Rogeria. this doesn't explain why it is called the IoC and I am surprised by the number of up votes ;-)
@George - Very helpful, thanks!
By the way, I upvoted you because I think it's an *excellent* question.
@Andy: Give him the Useless Use Of Cat award!
That's depressing :/ Are you sure I can't get a collection of all controls on the page with a particular class and give them a single data source?
I have a table that is referenced by a ton of other tables via foreign keys. I am trying to delete a Document record, and according to my execution plan, SQL Server is doing a clustered index scan on every one of the referencing tables. This is very painful. I thought having a FK automatically made an index on the FK fields? Or am I wrong? Do I really have to go around my database putting an explicit index on every single FK field?
I'm reading an excellent article by Paul White - ! and he uses this code: I'm trying to find out more about using dbo.Name to declare a variable, not having much luck with books online. Any ideas where I can find this? Thanks
I'm surprised nobody has encountered this issue before. It seems very painful for any medium sized project and must be horrible for larger projects.
that's the hope :)
@AlexK. excellent thought. Edited.
The current solution i implemented is awful! I use a for inserting records from an ADO.NET data-table into an SQL table. I would like to insert at once the data-table into the SQL table, without iterating... Is that possible, or am i asking too much?
This works excellent, thank you very much! (Trim('0'||mycolumns))
If double logins presented, it skipped it... looks so terrible))

That's excellent! Please post it as an answer so I can accept it.
What you can do here is hide the button that pushes the view that only instructors can see, if the user is logged in is of type student.In the view that has the button that pushes the view that only instructors can use do this:In the .h file create a property for the button that pushes the view like so: In the .m file:In the viewWillAppear method of the view do the following check: This way, when the view loads, the button that pushes the instructor view will only be accessible to the users of type "Instructor".Hope it helps!
To be honest I don't even know where to start. I guess the solution might entail using a zillion IIf statements. I'm fairly new to this I'm afraid!
I have a xml similar to this one: The thing is, Im able to get all the info tags, but I get the results from all dates. I dont know what the dates will be, since the are dynamic generated. What I know is that I may have a data tag with one or two date tags I wish I could show the first dateÂ´s info on a list box and the second dateÂ´s info on another listbox. How can I do that? Desirable Output: If thereÂ´s a second date then print it too: Thx!
I second trying to put the whole path instead. For relative paths, if you're doing compiling and running in command line/terminal, you need to have that studentrecords.txt in the same directory of your code files.If you're using an IDE, you need to put your studentrecords.txt under the src/ folder. This is assuming you're not in maven project setup; otherwise it should be put under /src/main/java/resources/ .Hope this helps!
You can use Mercurial on Google code now. I never tried git before but I'm loving Mercurial.
whenever i drag-n-drop a stored procedure onto my Context canvas, the parameters/arguments for the stored procedure are all nullable. Why is this? Is it because of how i've declared my parameters inside the stored procudure itself? Besides manually creating my stored procedure methods in the Context partial class (or drag-n-drop onto canvas, cut from autogen'd code, move to partial class, then remove nullables types) .. is there any way to fix this? It's really frustrating :(
Nope - gave up and went for a completely non-Ruby solution.
It's HORRIBLE! No, seriously, I don't like it.
worried about IE compatibility!!
The problem is that you never run the method, so the field stays at zero. It's a really terrible idea to give a field and a method the same name.
@Gary well, you _do_ get a non 0 return code if `rm -rf` fails to delete at least one file; as I said, tune to your needs ;)

When I refactor the following line: using Resharper's "Use Object Initializer", I get the following: I really hate this type of formatting because with longer object names and variables it just gets out of control. How can I get Resharper to do the following?

I should add that the element thing throws an error when it can't find something. Do you normally use try/except for all find_element commands? * oh so very sad * :(

This is a professional project in academia and I need to use Java for it - bc of my own limitations I'm afraid!
So, the following hack seems to work, but it's really incredibly ugly IMO, as it relies on you controlling the line-height and using absolute positioning. Worse, it requires you to know how many lines there are in your text, which depends on the width of the div and the font-size, and probably requires JS to compute.Anyway, after all the above disclaimers, here's the hack: Use two divs with the same text, one on top of the other. One justified, one centered. Then clip the justified one.HTML CSS Fiddle.Of course, the above code is hard-coded for the specific width. Again, you'll probably need JS in order to compute the number of lines in the div. I'm pretty sure that until this gets implemented in Webkit you probably won't find an elegant solution for your problem.
Per:https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213?hl=enYou need to be registered as a member of a Google + or Google Group that is designated for Beta or Alpha testing by the Developer. If you are not registered, you will only be able to download the production app from Google Play, NOT the Beta or Alpha version of the app from Google Play. Having the "link" won't be sufficient, you need to opt-in to the beta or alpha via Google + or Google Group. Please note that even if you properly opt-in via Google + or Google Groups as defined by the developer, you will need to wait several hours (perhaps 2-8 hours) for your status to propagate via Google Play. So, perhaps you need to wait 2-8 hours even if your Beta/Alpha status is proper?Hope this helps!

I'm not knowledgeable in the whole "server-side" idea. Right now, I just want to start learning how to send data from a windows mobile phone application to a server. I'm pretty good at C# and making apps. I just need to learn how to send data from and to a server/mobile application. I am using Silverlight (The latest one) as the API for my windows phone app. At the moment, a "hello world" sort of program would be awesome. Any help is is extremely appreciated! Subby~
Sorry, I wasn't clear. You would need to add that as a BOOL property on your class. It originally sounded as if you had a single place that handled the notifications and displayed the errors.
I have created a new project using core data then copied all of the app delegate code for core-data that i need over into my current projects app delegate.. my appdelegate.m looks like this now. My questions are as follows Is the URLForResource in this part of the code ment to reflect the name of my xcdatamodeld that I have created? With the URLByAppendingPathComponent: do i have to create a sqlite database called Code.sqlite or is this made automatically for me by the core-data code? what is the purpose of this method exactly? any help or tips would be really awesome!

I use the gem for transparent usage of Memcached. Using the supplied config file it is enabled on all modes (development, test, production). Is there a way to only activate cache-money in production mode? It's not immediately clear how to do this, and it's a total pain dealing with caching in development mode.
@prototypical - Absolutely. I was never to solve this xTo-1 issue and ended up creating mirror images for my sprites. I praised the genius who created keyboard shortcuts that day!
Per https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/ChangingAppStatus.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011225-CH30-SW1The "pending an Apple Release" means: Apple is holding your app version until the corresponding Apple iOS or OS version is released to the public. If you think an app should be released on existing iOS or OS versions, review the deployment target set in your app binary. If you rebuild your app binary with a different deployment target, reject the binary for this version and submit the new version.Sounds like you need to review the deployment target and if you change it, reject the binary and re-submit. If you need help with rejecting the binary, please let me know.Hope this helps!

Great to hear! Good luck implementing. If you have any questions, feel free to ask :)
Most of the times when Iphone program crash, compiler show stack with full of no's, but these no's don't make any sense to me. Very rarely it point out where the problem might be and mostly there are these useless no's. How you can make sure that when your program crashes while development/testing, it shows at what place this cause this crash?

My client sells jewellery in different materials such as gold, silver, oxidised, etc. When using the Layered Nav widget I would like to display the thumbnails corresponding to the selected filter. So if the users selects the 'gold' attribute in the widget, the gold thumbnails should display in the archive. Using ACF I added image fields to the main product for thumbnails and modified the action in my functions.php. I am trying to write a function that will retrieve the right thumbnail for the currently viewed filter but I cant find a way to check the active attribute for the page. I think it may be possible to use a query_var variable, but my knowledge is too limited. Any help will be hugely appreciated!

I am having trouble with adding text to the RichTextBox with tabs in it. I have code similar to this: And when I do this I can see tabs in paragraphs that start with '\t' but if I actually delete the tab then press the Tab key, the indentation is wrong. In fact it's about half the size exactly. Also if I tab in the middle of a line the tabbing is different. Also when I pull the Text out of the TextRange lines that start with tabs appear to not generate '\t's generated by pressing the Tab key. This is incredibly frustrating. Does anyone have advice or ideas how to work with this?

First off, 16*16*3*3 = 2304 - quite modest really. At this size I'd be more worried about the confusion likely to be caused by a 4D array than the size it is taking! As others have said, if it fully populated, arrays are ok. If it has gaps, an ArrayList or similar would be better. If the Strings are just IDs, why not store an enum (or even Integers) instead of a string?
@TonyThinkk No worries!!

I have a table with a field that needs to store 512 characters. My question is this: can you limit the length of a TEXT field (VARCHAR stops at 255 - I can't use it) to 512 characters? If I do that, will MySQL run through the table quicker due to the fixed data length, or does it act a bit like VARCHAR in that the length can vary? I don't have a table (at all) yet, but I'm very conscious about speed and size for the future. I found this article: incredibly useful - maybe you will to! Thanks a lot, James

Unfortunately the SMBIOS UUID is not unique on all systems. It should be but it isn't.

I am trying to figure out why foundation is acting differently to expected behaviour.

Note these images are from my rails application Image 1 - look at the '.tiny.secondary' button - no hover Image 2 - look at the '.tiny.secondary' button - with hover However on the page for foundation the color does not transition to the primary colour of the site. It transitions to a darker shade of grey. Have I missed some setting? Really frustrating me! I am guessing this is a bug in foundation

strange error. One of which i cannot find any existing resources to solve the issue. The issue is, when using I get pointed to a folder at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DevServer\10.0". Naturally, this breaks everything which depends on the correct folder (the one my solution is actually in) being given. What is more strange is that there exists a unit-test to make sure that this path at least has the correct root folder and sometimes it will pass and will be working as expected, and then the very next debug, will point to the aforementioned folder again. Very confusing and very annoying ! Any ideas ?
Excellent :) You should add that yourself as an answer and then accept it. It may be useful for others in the future.

I really hope you can help because I have been pulling my hair out on this one all day! We are in the process of developing an estate agency website and as part of this I am looking to develop a cluster map for the homepage which will have links to all of the properties. I have got the map geocoding a couple of dummy locations from the addresses that I added but when I have added the code to create a cluster it does not appear to be working. I am starting to think I have not added enough locations for this to click in but the demo's I have seen around have as little as 2 markers. Below is my code so far: I would really appreciate if you could test and any help or suggestions! Thanks in advance!
Afraid not! If I do so then it explicitly looks for quotes within the data, which it doesn't have.
Note that the given answers "only" handles making multiple variables of the same type. If, for some bizarre reason, you would need to do multiple types, this is valid (though awful):
For SQL Server 2005, I ALWAYS had to install the full product first, then Express second. If I did it the other way around, the full SQL install would see Express installed already, and would not continue with the install. It was extremely annoying. Not sure if they fixed this with 2008.

I have a few months of experience with Ruby on Rails and really loved it from the beginning on. Now, for work, I was asked to code in Grails and although I first had some objections, I now think it's a very decent framework. One thing that really impressed me in Grails are Taglibs because they make frontend modularity so much easier. I would really like to do something with Rails. Is there anything like Taglibs for Rails? If not, what are the best practices for accomplishing this kind of view modularity (and, in essence, making my life easier)?
I want to bulkload my cassandra data from node A to node B. when I set the 'listen_address' of each cassandra.yaml file to localhost, they do not show error on console but the data is never transmitted. when I set each node's listen address to their own local network[eth1 ipv4]address (192.168....), I get the following error. I can read from this error log that the application is trying to access to port 1..4 and I do not have no idea what on earth is going on. each node is on the virtual machine on the Virtual Box Hypervisor. Both OS is centOS. Here is my cassandra.yaml (the cassandra.yaml of target file is also configured the same way) thrift_max_message_length_in_mb: 16 Can anybody give me advice? I am really suffering as hell.
I see. Everything makes sense now. Thanks a lot for the excellent answers!
Oh and keep up the great work Alex, I really love were you are going with EF4!
excellent - thanks guys!
We added this snippet to LocalSettings.php, with great success: Thanks!
Nope, I don't think such a magic function exists. One workaround for this would be to put your functions into a static class, and add a magic method to that class (> PHP 5.3 only, I'm afraid): For PHP < 5.3, you could do the same thing, but you would have to instantiate an object and use the magic method.
If I start a process with exec(), how can I later terminate that process, with say pressing/sending the "q" key. Instead of using , you could look at using , which requires that you pass in an array specifying three -- one for , one for and one for . This will let you easily feed input into the program while processing output, without blocking just waiting for it to execute. You can later use to viciously murder it, if needed.

Is there any way to quickly jump to a scene in a storyboard? I have about 30 different scenes/view controllers and it has become incredibly tedious to locate the view controller I'm trying to edit.
So to do this I would keep a list of axes and when I delete the contents of one I would swap it out with a full one. I think the example below solved the problem (or at least gives an idea of how to solve it): The extremely ugly for loop construct is really just a placeholder to give an example of how the axes can be swapped.
Excellent! Worked perfectly!
scriptnames` was exactly what I was looking for to check if my plugins were being loaded.

FWIW, I agree with your original method (Rails 2). Creating models just for testing them makes your tests way too slow to run in continuous testing, so another approach is needed. Loving Rails 3, but definitely missing the convenience of proxy_options!

We are running Jenkins on a server that does not have internet access (even through proxy). Installing and keeping the Jenkins installation up-to-date is a pain! My idea was to make a local mirror of the complete Jenkins public update-site through a Windows workstation that has internet access.

You use shift to get a colon on a standard American QWERTY too.
When we have a cluster of machines behind a load balancer (lb), generally hardware load balancer have persistent connections, Now when we need to deploy some update on all machines (rolling update), the way to do is by bringing one machine Out of rotation, looks for no request sent to that server via lb. When the app reached no request state then update manually. With 70-80 servers in picture this becomes very painful. Can someone have a better way of doing it.
You also forgot operator overloading and duck typing.

I am relatively new to AngularJS and am loving every moment of it! I have an unordered list of products. When the user hovers over them, I need the list element to have an class set on them. I am currently doing it this way: And my showDetails is as follows: Now, everything is working just fine, however, I was wondering if it was possible to set the class without the ng-repeat and having no variable to bind to? How should I write my showDetails function to set the class this time? My first try is: But what do I do in the ng-class attribute?

Edit: I don't want to used TortoisePlink because it is SUPER SUPER SUPER SLOW! And https just cancels the connection after uploading several megabytes.
Oh, how I hate iframes!!!
@RenniePet That was the thing I was missing. Should edit this answer.
Extremely lousy solution.
So I came up with what is undoubtedly an extremely ugly solution: I took the Response JS data attributes out of the body tag, and used the Response.create method instead. Then someone suggested I make the plugin calls a function, then call the function after creating the Response data attributes. I have no idea why it works, but it does.
that made me cry :'(

There's always the poor man's alternative of just loading a bajillion individual frames as .gif/jpg/png and having javascript display them in sequence. It would be absolutely horrible for bandwidth and memory usage, and of course no audio, but it would (somewhat) simulate video being played. Of course, on Windows platforms, you could use ActiveX and/or embed media player and play avi/wmv files as well, without ever touching flash.

@delnan I was worried about !! and -, not function application.
I have a mobile web page with a table containing many rows. Each row has additional information. Ideally, when a user taps on each row, a new layer will display, covering the whole screen, that provides more information for each row. The layer can be closeable by tapping on the new layer itself. Is this something I can do with a to begin with? Or do these rows need to be divs instead? Please if someone could push me along, that would be excellent! Thanks.

If your system has installed, you'd better use it instead of the ing of the output of . Regarding you're question, how to loop through a list of processes, you'd better use an array.

I'll bet you that your main's function signature is incorrect. You use: but SDL_main.h wants Aside: You see, SDL does something really horrific when compiling: It renames your function to , injecting its own main function which, in turn, calls yours.

Getting the ssrs add-in to install properly was a complete pain. I think it had to do with the fact that we did development on the server prior to installing the ssrs add-in.

We're running into a really painful issue with Honeycomb's here, and I was wondering if anyone else has found a solution. The problem itself is quite simple: We frequently trigger background tasks in Activity or , since most of our screens must display data loaded from a Web service. While these tasks are running, we show the ActionBar's refresh spinner and animate it. The problem is: onCreate and onResume are executed before is, so at the point where we start the task, the refresh spinner doesn't even exist. Hence, it won't animate. I don't see any simple way around this. I guess we could keep the information about a task being spawned in onCreate, and as soon as the ActionBar becomes available, update it accordingly. But still, I can't believe a use case as common as this is so difficult to do with ActionBar?

I found an excellent tutorial on how to create site columns and content types - here : (THANKS AGAIN ROB!) Does anyone know of a written or video tutorial that will explain how to create a list and list instance in MOSS 2007. I use WSP Builder, and the build in templates from Microsoft aren't compatible (or up to the task). Preferably a method that focuses on the CAML (xml) , and explains in detail the theory, and demonstrates how it is done. Thank you.
not to worry, it was a permissions issue with the file!
So I need to get a quotient to 2 decimal places like 0.33, but do I need to use doubles all the way down or can I use integers for everything except the quotient and then just use double or decimal for the quotient? It is also breaking because of the quotient. If anyone could help me I would be extremely grateful :)
Actually this is possible, though extremely difficult! This post will get you started:

I need to do a strange task. I want to move whole android system to external SD card on Android Virtual Device. I need to do this, because android emulator, emulates SD commands, only for external card image. And I want to get SD commands trace, during Android Virtual Device usage. To be more precise: I want to move at least /system and /data folders to external storage. In such way, that system could still work fine =) Thank You!
Can the nodes be the same but be declared in a different order?
I have a file containing unsigned 64 bit integers in little endian format shown below I'm looking for a way to read these numbers in and then convert them to their decimal equivilant The code I have so far is as follows: which gives me the following output from the first number I've been looking at how to use structs for this as it seems like it is what it was made for but I've been unable to find the correct syntax using them. Any help would be hugely appreciated!
PHPExcel, so you did wrote that library. Excellent! For now max entries of CSV is 100,000 for a test. Maybe I lurk around with it if you introduce how to do that? thanks
Instead of saying: say: This would preserve the tag and also remove the malicious code from lines where the tag doesn't exist! EDIT: As by , you can say:

is there anyway to have two TextView in one AutoCompleteTextView result? e.g. And so on... The ArrayAdapter only allows one binding for a view so how could I bind more views in the adapter? Like so: I've created a new xml layout for the layout parameter in the ArrayAdapter except when I bind the TextView to the string array, it only sets the text to the TextView with the given id. I've also searched through the other posts about this one and it did not suit my needs. If anyone could help that would be absolutely great :) Thank you.
How can I make it more easier?
Remember to Include System.Text if you want to use StringBuilder.
@chucklukowski wow, that's just about exactly what I was looking for! I'll be giving that a read-thru. Much appreciated.

It might be a good idea to remove info from the table but remember that SQL works pretty fine with millions of rows! In your case, I'd run a cronjob every day that removes the rows that got made longer then 48h! I think that this would be enough.
Excellent, thanks again!

I'm using bootstrap modals to display a iframe all works well, but in ios 7 safari (ipad) the user can not type any text in any of the text boxes (the keyboard simply doesnt open, nor does it focus) or are they able to click any links, yet it displays on the screen absolutely fine! and outside of the iframe the site continues to function. has anybody else run into this? cheers
In my WinForms app (C#) I have a circle (defined by a ) that I am presently filling with a solid color. I would like to fill this with a circular (not linear) gradient (so one color in the center fades to another color uniformly around the edges). I have experimented with , but am having no luck (I still see a solid color). If anyone has any sample code that does this, that would be terrific!

No you can't do that. MySQL doesn't know how to handle PHP scripts.
@JasonCraig, No worries - You were basically there!
Personally, just because you can doesn't mean you should.
+1 for the `/* God I hate Microsoft! */` comment in the IE7 stylesheet.
You can just store it in a variable if it's scoped to each element:
I have two files. File 1: a FASTA file with gene sequences, formated like this example: File 2: A simple text file with JUST the accession identification of the gene. Like so. Every entry in File 2 is somewhere in File 1, but not every entry in File 1 is in File 2. I need to remove all the entries from File 1 that are not in File 2. I feel like there must be something in the biopython module that could help me, I just don't know what. For instance, I originally thought that I could extract just the accessions from my FASTA file using the function, but this really just lands me with two files of accession numbers. I don't know how to selectively extract the accessions that are in the other file. Maybe like reading all the entries from File 2 into a dictionary and then associated that entry with its matching entry in File 1 and use to extract the whole sequence...But I really don't know....Any help anyone could give me is extremely appreciated!

Ignacio is correct. However, as a heinous hack (totally ill advised and this really should get me at least 10 down votes) you can exec a new shell when you're done #!/bin/bash ... cd / exec bash

@PankajSharma no, this will still work, because of the GROUP BY clause
The inner loop returns to the caller regardless of the outcome. You should after the loop completes. Also, don't use . It's confusing (probably why you got it wrong (it should have been )) and you can just use the equality operator: , which is well-defined for (in case you were worried about the whole, "Don't compare using equality!" thing). But what you really should do is store the data in a map keyed on username and do a direct lookup:
You need to make the following changes to your code: However keep in mind that this is extremely vulnerable to SQL injection, and you should also swap MySQL for PDO/MySQLi immediately if you plan to use this code on a live website.

An easier way to do it is to make a "globally visible" function. AKA, declare it in a public header: and define it within your compilation "unit" - but outside any . As a little bonus.. it with an "alias".. and you can REALLy abuse it!
