Have you tried removing 'preload' attribute? (Afraid I can't be much help otherwise!)
Ok, I find the reason: device won't answer to simple user (and doesn't matter what permissions did you ask in program manifest). You can directly speak to device only if you are root (or from kernel mode). That means you cannot use devices directly from general applications. Very sad :(
I don't understand why (Apple in this moment I'm hating you!), but ALAssetsLibrary in iOS 4.3.4 does not allow fetching in a background thread (I was running a series of in a ). I solved by creating a little wrapper using . EDIT: After a code refactoring and the upgrade to iOS 5, I finally realized that the problem is actually related to how ALAssetsLibrary works, there is no need to use . .
Hi I'm using the chrome inspector (F12) to try and analyze the z-index of a twitter bootstrap popover, and finding it extremely frustrating... Is there a way to freeze the popover (while shown) so that I can assess and modify the associated CSS? Placing a fixed 'hover' on the associated link does not cause the popover to appear.
This is an absolutely horrid wart in the API, but it's never going away.
I am working with Eclipse (Indigo) to develop C projects. When I create a new C project in a new workspace, by default the "Autosave before build" option is not set. This is extremely frustrating, as autosave is usually the default behavior in other IDE's I worked on. I change some code, build and nothing seems to go as expected - until I remember that the option is not set... Is there a way to make Eclipse open a new workspace with this option set?
I have hit this too. No solution as yet. This is very worrying though!
Compare these two methods: Aside from the method signatures (bar can declare instead of ), is there any practical difference between the two methods? To be clear: I'm aware that this is a horrible approach to exception handling, and should not be done!
This is one of the shortcomings of DGV that I absolutely hate and why I almost always bind to an IEnumerable of an anonymous type.
Your are really violating the idea of TDD if your code if doing something different for the Test. Why do you only need to change it inside the test?
FEAR!!!!!!!!!!!
put your path and your shadow in a set. apply your animation to the set and it'll affect both. a really terrible example where I move both at once.
Still printed but had that dreaded extra page! -_-
I have developed a cumulative sum function as defined below in the Haskell library Repa. However, I have run into an issue when combining this function with the transpose operation. All 3 of the following operations take well under a second: However, if I write: performance degrades horrendously. While each individual operation in isolation takes well under a second on a 1920x1080 image, when combined they now take 30+ seconds... Any ideas on what could be causing this? My gut tells me it has something to do with delayed arrays, not forcing at the right time, etc... But I do not have enough experience to track this down quite yet.
@Mario I disagree, while the answer is outrageously awful, it's still an answer.
If I have a setup project in a VS 2010 solution and I add/remove another project, or unload/reload another project any setup projects in the solution are expanded in the solution explorer. It only does this for setup projects and it is extremely annoying. Is there any way to disable this behaviour?
@MikeChristensen that's horrible :| and weird!!
Can't find any manual about changing width of taglist element size. Taglist element is wider than icons I had set. It looks really awful =( Screenshot:
My guess is that you would have to extend the classes for DataTip, to check for NULL hitData objects, to kill/stop the drawing of the display. I do not think there is a way to do that normally in FLEX. You would have to customize and override the hitData class unfortunately. What a pain!!
By the way, I agree with Henrik P. Hessel. This is a very horrible piece of code.
I had a memory crash on UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext() ... if you're creating and releasing a lot of them, you should wrap them in a fresh AutoReleasePool for each iteration. Even allowing the NSRunLoop to tick WAS NOT ENOUGH for Apple/iOS to do housekeeping on garbage lying around from this. e.g.
i am currently having some difficulties trying converting a Unicode character string (DT_WSTR) into an INT this is what i have (Note most writings are in German, but i think someone who has worked with SSIS will unterstand anyways) Data Type selected: A four-byte, unsigned integer.but all it does is fail terribly
yes it does it in IE8 as well. Very annoying !
Out of all that pseudocode, the only thing that really worries me is "extracts code samples from file". Reading files from a directory is trivial, saving a file is trivial. Regardless of the test framework I'd spend most of my time focusing on the parsing bit. For direct testing, I'd embed the snippets directly into the test case: Ah, I see another change I subtly made while writing the test: my ExamplesToCode.parse() returns an Array (or other iterable container), so that it can be tested apart from the iteration itself.
as you can see folks hate spending time giving details on bad advice!
sounds scary !!
Back in the day I had to solve this with a panel where the text box is a component inside and had DockPadding set to 3 or 4 pixels. I'd then style that panel to a single pixel. I always found this really annoying!
the two are not mutually exclusive, archmage.
That's what I thought...but I'm terrible with C. Absolutely terrible.
That's really sad...
If I delete this question will it increase my reputation? 5 down votes it really sad.
Shameeeee on me!!!
I need from document object or from a DOM element (i.e. a DIV) to know which is its window object. In Firefox I can do: but obviously in that AWFUL browser that statement not work!!!
I have a fairly large codebase with several directories and files and I would like to check out a view or have a view as of a given date (Septermber 12th). I am manually checking file histories and doing and this is extremely painful. I wonder if there is a way to do a checkout and load everything as of a particular day at once?
After I changed my windows regional setting from my native language to USA, the problem has gone. Do not forget to restart Visual Studio. really annoying problem !
It's impossible to receive unicast UDP packets in Silverlight (rage!!!).
yeah, compiled, but output is so horrible !!!
I agree with this. For *non-essential services* increasing timeouts is incredibly frustrating.
There's an error here: $r3 only has one result column (which you haven't given a name). Are you sure you are using the correct variable because there's no way that your code should work as you have posted it. Also your variable naming is really awful. Use meaningful names instead of , , etc...
OK, then, no solution that going DB mysql... so sad ! :-( i will close the question !
@Aggieboy that's really sad, and I have to hand-code stuff .
The 0x1A byte is a terrible, painful [source of agony](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12483711/serialdata-eof-circumstances).
This does seem to be the answer. Absolutely terrible API design.
That is awful advice! I don't mean to be overtly mean but I lolled.
Oh, absolutely horrible practice. But still the answer he was looking for.
Effective, but what a pain! You'd think there'd be an easier way.
Putting data in the ID is a terrible, terrible idea.
avoid the auto method, to apply by hand is such painful :(
You must be a sad sad person...
Somewhat new to OOP (i.e. C programmer converting to C++) and cannot figure out why my data members in my backpack class are empty. I make pass an array of potions to my backpack, yet the data members are saying mType = "" (i.e. nothing). I have never felt this lost in a program before. Starting to hate OOP (i.e. kidding...but this extremely frustrating). main.cpp potion.cpp backpack.cpp
Tools -> Options -> Projects & Solutions -> Build and Run "On Run, when projects are out of date:" Select "Always Build" That's it, had it myself, extremely annoying.
I got to this question via the Almighty Google. To complement on what Andrew said above, for those of you on OSX you might want to take a peek at /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/Resources/vim/runtime/indent/html.vim and the modifications necessary should become evident. I can't believe I spent so much time suffering from poorly indented <li>s!
From my experiences so far, I've concluded that the HTML5 Manifest scheme was really terribly designed. My site serves a manifest file when a user is logged in. Unfortunately, when they log out, they can still access the cached protected materials. Can anyone think of a way to fix this?
Tried it again - it worked. God I hate reporting services!
Someone is scared to tell the reason of -1 !
Although, using this outside testing is a horrible, horrible idea...
Can I fix the width and the height of jQueryMobile dialog? Currently, the size of width is 100% which is really awful in iPad.
Maybe someone knows how to disable content assist only on 'else' keyword when working with PHP source editor in Aptana? As I really, really hate it with this keyword, because after newest release it's really messing with my workflow as after entering 'else' and pressing enter it replaces it with: and sometimes it decides to get rid of indents completely. Mind you I don't want to disable content assist completely, I just want to disable it for 'else' keyword.
I have just started using Vim in a terminal (PuTTY or MinTTY), after always using gVim. However, when using syntax highlighting, rather than the actual text colour changing appropriately, its background is changed to whatever colour -- and it looks horrible! I've set my terminal to use 256 colours and downloaded a 256 colour colour scheme. I checked that the and settings are as I expect, but I still get this problem... Is this a Vim or a terminal configuration issue?
I am developing a web page which embedded a "Google maps" view. In this web page, the user must specify several positions on the maps At this time, I am able to spread the balloons on the map displayed when the user click on a button to be dragged, but according to the zoom it can be very painful to zoom in and out to drag the balloon to a place. I would like to know if it could be possible to have a panel with all balloons to drag/drop on the map? My current development : My target :
Talking about feelings.. I really hate the asp.net CalendarExtender..
Horribly inefficient! It re-encodes the image each time. Try this instead.
Oh, this was was a pain! I probably lost 2 hours on this. Here is the solution: CMake uses short 'C' applications to test/try things. If the CMakeLists.txt states that C++ is used for the project, without also listing C, then some of those shorts tests incorrectly fail, and cmake then thinks those things aren't found. The solution was to change the first line of CMakeLists from this: ...to include C as a language: Then delete , recreate it, and everything then works:
I am building the Android OS on Mac OSX (Lion), and Eclipse as an IDE. I am trying to understand certain parts of the OS however this requires performing many searches throughout the project. These searches take 5 or 10 minutes on Eclipse, and the way they are presented is also extremely annoying. Also, I need a separate editor to open up the native files found in the OS, since if they are opened in Eclipse there is no color coding of the C++ syntax. I feel that Eclipse is really slowing me down - can anyone suggest a better IDE for browsing the Android OS (preferably free)?
I recently worked on a product that was targeted to .NET 3.5. Out of hundreds of beta testers, I can probably count on one hand the number that already had .NET 3.5. The rest had to sit through the absolutely painful .NET 3.5 install from microsoft (~30 minutes, and most of the time the progress bar stays near 0 so people think it is broken).
I wish I'd have found this question yesterday, as it has been causing me grief for hours! Surely this is a bug with the emulator?
I'm doing one app which requires AJAX call on almost every user interaction possible, I started writing JS functions, webservices etc. to handle all of that(still long way to go from here). Now I am wondering If I made a mistake maybe I should put whole page in update panel because I really hate writting JS. Is there some drawback to use it instead of custom written ajax calls to web service and js functions, and is it better to use more update panels or one big?
The problem was due to a malfunctioning . Very painful and a lot of time wasted.
I'm trying to do this in a makefile and it fails horribly: do you know why? I guess it has to do with escaping, but what and where?
the problem that I am having is while designing an email to be sent to users the border of the HTML table is not disappearing even though it is set to 0 and so leaves horrible white lines through areas which are menu to be solid blue colors, below is my HTML code! Untitled Document
ps really hate the response limits on comments.
clicking the zoom (or pan) button again, restores it. terribly silly - yes!
done... stackoverflow makes you wait several minutes. I really hate that
@Rob same problem, nothing. very disgusting
Why do you need the class explicitly? Couldn't you use the interface? Note that casting is not encouraged, which is why it looks so awful in Scala!
I have a page running on my local django dev server with the Django Debug Toolbar that seems to be running quite slowly but I'm unsure why: Django Debug Toolbar says SQL - 46 queries in 39.80ms And then running a profiler I get 7926 function calls (7774 primitive calls) in 0.024 seconds So I'm left wondering why is the profile time so much lower than the Total CPU Time? And then how can I find out what's causing the difference? And secondary to that - should i be worried about the 16842 involuntary context switches!?
It sounds very scary to me to use a floating point number for a key in a `map`.
Ahw... that's plain sad :(
Extending the class to handle new tags or syntax is not a bad idea, but eval'ing inline ruby code from a possibly untrusted source is an absolutely horrible idea!
Im trying to work with this awful language and I have to change an item of list by accessing to it with index I dont understand the awful syntax of TCL! How can I realise it?
This is extremely ugly C-style code, easy to get wrong. While the bugs in your code have been fixed by earlier birds, here is the C++ way to do this:
I am working on an app that uses some basic view types, but I find the default attributes extremely ugly in Android (for example, a bright yellow ). I can get the basic seekbar if I create it from code, using only the parameter, but I would like to know if there is a way to do this inside an XML Layout file. Is there an attribute I can set that will remove all default attributes - such as ?
@BoristheSpider :( :( That is really sad. :(
here's my hack that assumes arguments are all imaginary: ...horrible! but what you ask for isn't really possible without for instance hacking to dispatch to a new subtype of java.lang.Number. Really it would make more sense to use a Java or Clojure complex number library.
I am experiencing exactly this problem (and am in exactly the same world of pain): Whereby I am offering an update to SQL using LinqToSQL and it is failing with a because is set to . Due to legacy databases also on the server I am targeting, I am not able to re-configure the default connection settings as is quite rightly stated in the accepted answer in . My question is: How do you convince LinqToSQL to run a SQL before executing an update?
I'm currently having exactly the same issue with Monotouch and that's why I found your question. I get the very same exception as you do. This makes me assume that I'm not facing a Monotouch issue but a basic (mis)behavior of XIBs/Cocoatouch. So the answer is: no, it is not possible. Very sad though. RenÃ©
That's horrible!!
I just tried installing those missing plugins ... what a pain!
can I replace my entire windows vista with ubuntu and is it free? I really hate vista
I've been tackling the same issue. It's a pain!
Why would you do that? You're begging for horrible debugging sessions!
I found this great node mysql boilerplate: it works terrific! However, now I need to hook it in to my existing user table, and my key field is named userID, not simply id, and changing the key fieldname in mysql breaks the example. So my question is, where in the project do I need to specify a different id field name? I see user.id in /util/auth.js passport.serializeUser and id in passport.deserializeUser functions, but it seems it must be specified elsewhere too. I'm hoping this is a simple question for users of passportjs!
I'm trying to create some ads in Admob, but on last step I always get error: but it didn't specify WHERE. I swear god, there are no errors on whole page, all fields are correctly filled, I see no red shapes around fields, everything match criterias written under fields, but I stil get this error - without any explanation. Has anybody same experiences? It's totally frustrating :(
Scary question!
I'm not sure that the given approach will work with hosts using NPT/EPT.
Come on, you are worrying about efficiency while your first line of code is incorrect!
I don't see how this is possible, but I really, really hate to run my query an extra time just to get the record count so I can build a pager. When I say a "pager" I simply mean the common gizmo with a link for each 10 records for example.
I can't believe that answer from a company. Horrible!
Well, this is a bit of an awful hack but quite frankly any C++ application which needs a way to define an unconstructable object is probably already an awful hack! And under GCC, I get the following: test.cpp: In function âint main()â: test.cpp:9: error: cannot declare variable âan_instanceâ to be of abstract type âlaâ test.cpp:2: note: because the following virtual functions are pure within âlaâ: test.cpp:4: note: virtual void la::oh_no_you_dont()
Very scary! O_O
no, it is not possible -- we tried hard and ended up reverting to the 10.7 way of using a custom class.. check MAAttachedWindow well with enough swizzling and posing it'd be possible of course... but that is very evil and at least as much work as your own class!
EDIT: Also you should avoid using it can make debugging extremely frustrating.
So "options" always has one item, and "option" can have multiple? What a horrid API!
:~) Very embarrassing!!! When I debugged and printed the receiving addresses, I realized that I was checking the wrong email account! Sorry to have taken your time.

Since ChangeSets are becoming too many to handle because of many checkins, I'm thinking of selecting multiple changesets then create a single work item link for code review purposes. It's really painful to create work item per changeset and assign to a code-reviewer. Is this possible?
I just installed AndroidStudio in my System I am trying to create my Very First Project . I set up JAVA_HOME and Android SDK path that has been used previuosly by eclipse in Android Studio Android SDK has the below versions for Tools and Platform Android SDK Tools - 22.6.2 SDK Platform - 19 As soon as started Android studio downloaded the Gradle-1.12 in the below path C:\Users\DELL.gradle\wrapper\dists\gradle-1.12-all after that it shows the build screen as below. This screen is shown for ever . It is not moving further. can anyone help me in this. I am sad!
Right, I've got this horrible mess of html and erb (that does work!), but I want to do things properly and render the whole thing with the method. But I'm not sure how to do this, I can only render text with the link_to at the moment.
Sometimes in a long commit log, it's really painful to navigate the all-expanded diffs. (You get expanded-diffs when hitting enter from the magit-blame-mode for example) Is there a way to collapse these diffs?
I am working on a test application based on ASP.NET MVC. I am new to CSS stuff so I am learning that as well. I have created a master page called "new.master" and created a new css "new.css". I am calling the view from controller as: What I am doing is that I am frequently updating the css and master page. So I run the application in debug mode frequently. After sometime I stop seeing the effect of changes in css. When I "view source" in chrome and check the css, it shows an old version. When I change the name of both master page and css, I start to receive updated views but that works for sometime and then again I stop getting the CSS updates. Have you faced this problem? How can I fix it? (Its terribly annoying!)
I am very jealous of your name!
Finally found something, here: No reference to it from the Oracle pages, but found a direct link to a page on some forum post. Really sad how hard it was to find.
i have an assignment at my company to build a custom cms, for the foundation i ve chosen latest laravel(version 4, i believe). Now, the requirements in laravel docs() say minimal version of php on server required is 5.3.7, our servers have php 5.3.23. I am right now on a weekend, so i cant check my code on the server( been developing the basics on localhost with xampp which has latest php). Has anyone tried laravel 4 on pre-5.3.7 php?? i m very worried all of last week's work is going to the bin... :(
No betas involved, the lack of repro is really annoying me!
When I click on Memcache Viewer the whole dashboard crashes and I have to login again. This is really worrying me as we are serving data to many users. A server error has occurred. Is there a way to see the internal logs? I can't see anything in nor . Is there any other way to reset the Memcache?
It's HORRIBLE! No, seriously, I don't like it.
No, unless there's a relevant IE zero day. Obviously, this would be a huge abuse of user privacy (if you want their name, ask them!).

I have a function name called setValue, used in many classes. Also, i have a global function by the same name. When i press C-], it goes to arbitrary setValue function. How do i directly jump to the global setValue function? It is really pain to use tnext every time to find if the function global.
EF CTP5 is still having this bug! Anyway there is a simple work around for now See more here: Be aware that Count() is total rubbish performance wise!
@vascowhite I tried deleting all the products from the cms then added a new one and the same message appears. Really frustrating!
Oh, I am scared!
I am completely hopeless with regular expressions... I have a Velocimacro named , and I have a JS function named . Now I want to find all the places the JS function is called. So I need to search for "addButton", where "addButton" doesn't start with the hash key. Any ideas?
I really despise SWFObject for this very reason. Maybe you could give a try
as was already established, this is a miserable, horrible, awful, and terrible idea from a concurrency perspective. Anyway, since your question is really about Go's type system, here's how you would define a type with a recursive method.
I cannot seem to figure out why the phpunit target does not output any test results even though I have tests in position. The problem I am finding is there is no indication as to what the problem is! Incredibly frustrating. The output is as follows: My build.xml is as follows: My system: Vista, PHP 5.2.9, PHPUnit 3.4, PHPUnderControl, CruiseControl
I am new to Delphi (been programming in it for about 6 months now). So far, it's been an extremely frustrating experience, most of it coming from how bad Delphi is at handling dates and times. Maybe I think it's bad because I don't know how to use TDate and TTime properly, I don't know. Here is what is happening on me right now : That's not the exact code I use, everything is in variables and used in another context, but I think you can see the problem. Why is that calculation wrong? How am I suppose to work around this problem?
Okay so say we have a graph with a ball on it at (200,200) and we swipe our finger from (0,0) to (100,100) how do I go about moving the ball to (300,300)? This should be simple but it is really hurting my head! This is the code I have so far (using andengine)
Either you want to group or you don't. Now which is it? (This is why I really hate how MySQL allows non-aggregates in `GROUP BY`)
I can't get to work a many-to-many relationship using bookshelf.js. Models: Database table "events": Database table "tags": Database table "events_tags": Query that isn't returning what it should: The log outputs: That is: empty array of tags, which is wrong. Question: Is there an issue with my code? the desired output should be: This doesn't help in the question, but I'll throw it anyway: I'm currently hating all ORMs in Node JS! Maybe I should just use a query builder.
Here is an incredibly disgusting way to do it: Here is a better way (I think): If you convert either output string with: you get your original number.
After reading I was horrified! Isn't there a tool out there that can inspect a .h/.cpp file and deduce what dependencies could be waivered?
Nobody? To do this with a Button is really disgusting.

Yes, yes it is. It is really horrible though. There is also this atrocity:

Work-around (horrible horrible invasive work-around) I got around this by subclassing UIApplication to track all screen touches. By holding on to the last touch location, I can, in the delegate, map the location to the link to determine whether or not it should be considered valid: MyCustomApplication.m (use it in main.m) And map it...

My company is just starting to look at using WPF for migrating all of our 10 year old business applications. These applications will most of the time be running on computers that have limited/old hardware. We are now a little worried that the hardware might be too limited for using WPF. We have installed Family.Show () on an basic older computer and that seems to run ok. But we would like know what your experiences with WPF on older hardware is? Anyone out there willing to share some experiences with us?
you have your terminology horribly confused.

In this case, I'd keep the DoStuff() method but subscribe to it with: Admittedly that won't please those who do all their event wiring in the designer... but I find it simpler to inspect, personally. (I also hate the autogenerated event handler names...)
I'm not good at programming and my trying to open one of my spreadsheet documents. Below in the basic login im using, I then request a list all my spreadsheet, which is returned in $feed. And now I'm worried I'm not on the right track with opening a document so I can read and write cells.
You forgot regression tests - it is a real pain for a manual tester to run through hundreds of forms just to check for some basic stuff which could be easier done automatic. Better spare the tester this tedious stuff, so he can concentrate on the nasty testing.
It's scary that there is no way, but I must agree because it's fact.
This is how you find the arc length given the parameter, but finding equidistant points requires the inverse of this function. Getting from one to the other is not trivial. @Christian Romo: how did you do it? I mean, you can just use binary search, but that would be horribly slow (for what I'm trying to do, anyway).
I was intending on use the Title attribute in the @Page directive to customise each pages title, but it simply doesn't appear to do anything. The site uses master pages - I don't know if that is a consideration. Master Page snippet: Page snippet (from ): What is more, if I run the page through the , it complains about... end tag for "head" which is not finished ..whereas the the tag is present in the source code. I've already got a workaround in place, but it's annoying the hell out of me, so I'm determined to find a resolution!
Horrible answer because it is just wrong.
I have VS2005 installed. But I was afraid about installing VS2008 and lose everything. I think I have to install 3.5 framework first. Is that correct?
I was wondering if there was somewhere I could get some starter kit / theme sample for ASP.NET. I am not a designer, but I need to build a prototype for a project, and if I do it myself it'll certainly be awful Do you know where I could find that (ASP.NET specific)?
I have created a VB.Net lending application for a cooperative that caters to widows. The application tracks the members' loans and payments, and is also used as an accounting system. In my first release, the users felt that showing a messagebox every time an error occurs is very annoying. My solution is to output errors in a label control. The users accepted the modification, but i feel i am doing it wrong.
I'm writing an Eclipse plugin for the JDT. I need a functionality that tracks certain strings or regular expressions and possibly creates markers. I know that Eclipse already does that for //TODO comments, for example (creating task markers for them) but I'm not sure if I can use the same mechanism. I can write my own but worried it would be too inefficient and not sensitive enough to code chnanges.
This is a terrible idea, as a compact on a database already in a suspect state can lose data that would otherwise be recoverable before the compact. Compact On Close should under all circumstances be turned OFF.
This is similar to the accepted answer (because it is using Java to represent the newline rather than EL) but here the <c:set/> element is used to set the attribute: The following snippet also works, but the second line of the <c:set/> element cannot be indented (and may look uglier):
Restoring splitter distances has given me a lot of grief too. I have found that restoring them from my user settings in the form (or user control) Load event gave much better results than using the constructor. Trying to do it in the constructor gave me all sorts of weird behaviour.
I guess that works, but I'd never do that. It's screaming bad practice. Think about code readability etc.. Come back to your code in six months and figure out all the function calls inside your HTML markup.
My form receives asynchronous callbacks from another object on random worker threads. I have been passing the data to the main thread (where it can be used to update onscreen controls) using delegates as shown below. Performance is dreadful -- once I reach 500 updates per second, the program completely locks up. My GUI processing itself is not the problem, as I can simulate this level of updating within the form and have no problems. Is there a more efficient mechanism I should be using to hand off the data from thread to thread?
I would suggest FlexUnit for automated testing of libraries you're building but it is a serious pain to use for a full application.
7 seconds between asking and answering it yourself? Isn't that abusing the system a little?
Ooh, I feel your pain. I've added some more to my answer. The operator precedence is in the VB6 help
Another thing I hate to see is the : I've seen this in real code.

My application links against libsamplerate.a. I am doing this to make distributing the final binary easier. I am worried that perhaps the code inside the .a file depends on some other libraries I also will need to distribute. But if it doesn't I am worried I am bloating up my application too much by including multiple copies of eg. libc. What exactly will be inside libsamplerate.a? Just libsamperate's bytecode? Or more?
As a dev I worry about event logs getting full and then hitting an error when logging an error. But I suppose you have to deal with 'logging' failures with whatever you are logging to (file/db).
on the root window is how xbindkey does it. Be careful about having some alternative method of killing the grab though, it's very annoying to have to go somewhere to into your own box just to kill that process... And that's why, if it was me, +"echo 'moo' > /tmp/moo-fifo" would be the way to do it. That way, you could also control it in any number of other ways you haven't thought of yet.
When you say it didn't detect it do you really mean you were collecting everything and the packet you wanted wasn't there? I find that hard to believe. It doesn't need any configuration, it just works. Getting a sensible filter so it gets what you want and not loads of other crap is harder!
I'd forgotten to put the code tags around it and everything was garbled and the formatting was terrible for about the first 90 seconds of life. Apologize to those who clicked quickly and saw the garbage.
I am fed up having to turn them on every time I open the application.

might be an answer, but I'm afraid I can't speak from experience.
I've tried msysGit and Git on Cygwin. Both work just fine in and of themselves and both run gitk and git-gui perfectly. Now how the heck do I configure a mergetool? (Vimdiff works on Cygwin, but preferrably I would like something a little more user-friendly for some of our more... Windows-loving coworkers.) Thanks!
You might want to consider using , a replacement for Windows' terrible command-line chrome. It offers fully redefinable keyboard shortcuts plus tabs, so it's ideal for IRB.
I worked on a desktop app that used EJB and Hibernate. We had to set everywhere, because when the objects get serialized, they lose their ability to be fetched from the backend. That's just how it goes, unfortunately. If you are concerned with performance, you could use caching on the backend so that your non-lazy fetches are not as painful.
Any progress on this one? To embed complex functionality (including history-aware interactivity) on an MVC page without involving the rest of the page is a reasonable and common desire. The only alternative I see, to require the using page to track each components query-string state, is horrible.
Not without logging or tracing, I'm afraid
If you can edit the code, you should just re-write it to use a custom API that does what you want. Failing that, use Maximilian's technique, but be warned that it is a maintenance horror. If you cannot edit the code, you can patch the import tables to redirect calls to your own code. A description of this technique can be found in - search for the section titled "Spying by altering of the Import Address Table". This is dangerous, but if you're careful you can make it work. Also check out , which does the same sort of thing but doesn't require you to mess around with the actual patching.
This ws-addressing issue is a real pain in the ass. Not only does WSS2 use an old, pre-release version of WS-Addressing, it adds propritery elements to the soap header (e.g. wsa:via) that arent part of the schema. What a crock.
I currently have speakers set up both in my office and in my living room, connected to my PC via two sound cards, and would like to switch the set of speakers I'm outputting to on the fly. Anyone know an application or a windows API call that I can use to change the default sound output device? It is currently a bit of a pain to traverse the existing control panel system.
I want to catch all URL's in the root folder of the url www.example.com The url cannot end in a trailing slash, and can't contain any slashes at all. so these should pass: www.example.com/abc www.example.com/abc123-asdf www.example.com/abc123/ ** fail! www.example.com/asdfsd/asdf ** FAIL!
too bad this behavior isn't a setting. I think it makes sense in theory why they did it this way, but in practice it's just really annoying
Part of the reason why this is "Dog Slow" is that you are building the proxy every time you connect to the service. You could avoid this pain by using wsdl2ruby to build the proxy permanently and then call the pre-generated proxy.
The ebook summarises Thread.Suspend and Thread.Resume thusly: The deprecated Suspend and Resume methods have two modes â dangerous and useless! The book recommends using a synchronization construct such as an or to perform thread suspending and resuming.
I tested this code out with an Access 2007 database with no exceptions (I went as high as 13000 inserts). However, what I noticed is that it is terribly slow as you are creating a connection every time. If you put the "using(connection)" outside the loop, it goes much faster.
If I can avoid it, no. And, to my knowledge, there is always a way to avoid it. But I'm not stating that it's totally useless either
I am suffering from the problem in the first example - my enums don't show up at all. This answer doesn't even attempt to address that issue.
Ew, that sounds a bit ugly! Is it possible for an instance of a class to be created before its unit's initialization section has run? In other words could an instance of TMyObject try to use FLogger before it's been set in the initialization section?
RegEx is a horrible option for performing replaces on a large amount of text. As powerful as it is, many RegEx proponents see all the world as a nail and RegEx as their hammer. For use cases involving large amounts of text, look at FastReplacer http://stackoverflow.com/a/11442008/141172
I have a .net assembly that has a COM+ ServicedCopmonent in it and at the moment I install it into the GAC to get everything working. This means that I need to have every assembly that it references in the GAC as well. During development it is quite painful to make changes to thes assemblies, re-install them to the GAC and then test. Is it possible to maintain the COM+ component but not have everything in the GAC?
Matt - can you revue the accepted answer. You have to scroll a long way to get to a [pure javascript answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5686237/360211) and I fear some users just take the accepted answer as gospel and use antiquated libraries as a result.

I need to pass a regex substitution as a variable: This, of course, doesn't work. I tried eval'ing the substitution: but that didn't work either. What horribly obvious thing am I missing here?
This was annoyingly annoying... If you have a the need to export your RegexBuddy history you can take a look at , which prints to the console your history, also as Json.
I'm working on a webservice + AJAX interface, and I'm worried about authentication. This moment I'm passing username and password to the webservice as arguments, but I fear that this approach is highly insecure. I was told that ssl could solve my problem, but I want more alternatives. My webservice is written in php and my interface is in php + AJAX. The webservice receives arguments from POST or GET and retreives xml (in a future maybe I'll use JSON)

@Michael: dude, I feel your pain (since my HOWTO search led me here).
Background: I'm currently debugging an application written over a custom-built GUI framework in C++. I've managed to pin down most bugs, but the bugs I'm having the most trouble with tend to have a common theme. All of them seem to be to do with the screen refreshing, redrawing or updating to match provided data. This is a pain to debug, because I can't break on every refresh, and most of this stuff is time-sensitive, so breakpoints occasionally "fix" the bug. Q: Does anyone have any tips for debugging Windows-based GUIs, especially regarding the refreshing of individual components?
Something that has always bugged me is how unpredictable the method in Javascript is. In my experience, the timer is horribly inaccurate in a lot of situations. By inaccurate, I mean the actual delay time seems to vary by 250-500ms more or less. Although this isn't a huge amount of time, when using it to hide/show UI elements the time can be visibly noticeable. Are there any tricks that can be done to ensure that performs accurately (without resorting to an external API) or is this a lost cause?
Is there a way to reuse a 3rd party control reference? For example, I have this referenced in my App.xaml I don't want to repeat this 3rd party control xml namespace on each page/control that needs a control from the library. Is there anyway to centralize these references and use the prefix defined here? The possibility of each control having a different prefix is also worrisome. In asp.net you would put a reference in the web.config and it was available globally, I'm just looking to see if there is a similar method in WPF.
A colleague recently asked me how to deep-clone a Map and I realized that I probably have never used the clone() method- which worries me. What are the most common scenarios you have found where you need to clone an object?
The solution is crying out for the MSMQ solution but unfortunately the posting service is not on the domain. Is there anyway to post to the public queue that is on the domain from the machine in the DMZ? I could use a webservice to post but this is a extra component to maintain. The database table is the alternative solution but again it is not the ideal.
Sorting the hashes is also a possibility that I have considered. I'm a bit concerned about memory usage, but I'll worry about that later.
I've been trimming the UI of our website by doing the following in the onload event of that control: This has become very tedious because there are so many controls to check again and again. As soon as I get it all working, designers request to change the UI and then it starts all over. Any suggestions?
That's horrible.
We ended up using a Java applet. It was a nightmare. Normally it would have been awful, but as this was for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the added distance & language differences made it a nightmare. In the end, it worked "enough." But again, nightmare. I would not recommend it.

I'm doing a fair bit of work in Ruby recently, and using Is absolutely critical. However, I'm really disappointed with the default Windows console in Vista, especially in that there's a really annoying bug where moving the cursor back when at the bottom of the screen irregularly causes it to jump back. Anyone have a decent console app they use in Windows?
I have a screen with say 20 controls on it. I want to show all twenty, then hide only the ones that don't relate to what I'm working on. My problem is that between the loops the screen paints.

Is there a way to set "work offline" in TFS without having to try opening a solution, waiting for it to time out, and then having Visual Studio work out that it has failed?

I would tend to leave them open -- but open them with the file share permissions set to allow other readers and make sure you flush log output with every message. I hate programs which don't even let you look at the logfile while they are running, or where the log file isn't flushed and lags behind what is happening.
FlexMonkey may be more of a pain than it is worth. Gorrilla Logic claims it works with custom components but I have found this is not the case. Anything with a renderer seems to have serious problems. It is a lot harder to set up tests than they claim and the tests aren't stable. I have written tests for one component 5 times now using hardcoded ids. Sometimes it just can't see the component and it dies. They only have 3 short paragraphs explaining tests in their user guide and they only respond to questions about how to set it up on their google group. I would avoid using this.
What you are asking is inherently impossible. The game runs on the client and is therefore completely at the user's mercy. Only way to be sure is running a real time simulation of the game on the server based on user's input (mouse movement, keypresses), which is absolutely ridiculous.

To push it to Heroku, you'll have to add it to your repo. Why don't you want to commit it? It's recommended to commit Gemfile.lock in your repo (unless you're developing a gem): When developing an app, check in your Gemfile.lock, since you will use the bundler tool across all machines, and the precision enforced by bundler is extremely desirable for applications.

I absolutely hate cluttered seed files. Admittedly, it's a personal preference and not a right or wrong. Here's what I did in my app at work to handle the significant volume of seed data we are required to use: My seeds.rb file: A sample seed file in the seeds/ folder: This has the effect of loading our seed files in the desired order (using 01_ then 02_, etc.). It also breaks up our seeds into logical groupings and organizes them in such a way that, for our team, we can more easily manage them.

Not for me, but I can suggest some possibilities :It may cause problem while editing--> This can be solved by using some comments--> And then this will cause the code messier Some code may crash and your code success will go away from you |.|--> No solution - unless you know more about the code! Code upgrade problem-- If external code has upgrade you may have problem to know which is that code--> Again use comments--> And again messier So these are some that I can think about!EDIT---Some cons:You can make it more convenient to edit--> You can edit more than one code at onceYou can edit some code that you wan't able to edit (external resource before)--> Modifying is more convenient.You can make it load faster--> 1 file with 1000 KB is faster than 1000 files with 1 KB each.It is safer--> You don't need to worry about external resource being deleted!!These are my suggestions. Try to think more about it!

This is a hack. It does not load the whole file into memory. I really hope you use Python 3.DecodeLargeJSON.py If you notice some objects that can not be decoded then you can tell me and we can find a solution.Disclaimer This is not the valid and best solution. It is a hack that shows how it can be made possible.Discussion Because it does not load the whole file into memory, regular expressions do not work. It also uses the Python implementation and not the C implementation. This could make it slower. I really hate how this easy task is hard. Hopefully somebody else points out a different solution.
Okay, a before <example> And a desired after <example> I know, horrific (don't ask!) See how the slash in the key indicates children, and how the order is nested accordingly? And items without orders are simply shifted to the bottom. But also how multiple 'same level' items with the same order are merely sorted by key?
Everytime I execute my app in debug mode, the execution breaks inside some class file of an external library that I'm using. Even though it's a NullPointerException, for some reason I can hit resume and continue the execution. In case you're curious, I've put the stacktrace below. My problem though is that I simply want to stop that. It's extremely annoying and happens every now and then during the execution. But I can't find any setting anywhere which will prevent breaking inside class files. How do I avoid this?
I cannot seem to figure out why the phpunit target does not output any test results even though I have tests in position. The problem I am finding is there is no indication as to what the problem is!

Anyway to avoid that?
Yeah, I know, I just can't figure out where the 'private' is coming from. It's very frustrating!

I'm not for sure how the ControlCollection of ASP.Net works, so maybe someone can shed some light on this for me. I recently discovered the magic that is extension methods and Linq. Well, I was very sad to find that this isn't valid syntax However from what I can tell, does implement the interface which provides such methods, so what gives? Why doesn't that just work? I have found a decent work around for this issue at least:

exactly why i'm asking because thats what i fear!
This will compile a regular expression that matches one or more This opens the file located at for reading, assigning the subsequent file object to the variable the function of file objects returns a list of the lines of the object. It is exactly identical to on systems that use as a newline. (Windows typically uses ) This splits the FIRST element of ( ) including everything but the LAST element ( ) on the regex you defined earlier (that, again, catches all -> )Note that this is really awful code. There's no reason to use a regex here, and using when you're only looking for the first line is kind of like building an engine so you know what the spark plugs look like. This is better:
I need to perform the same hash server side. All this code that I am digging through seems to have been run through some compression tool. Devastating.
I really hate people who downvote for no reason. Just tell me what your problem is in a comment after you downvote. God!
You are processing the newline character as if it is legitimate input. You should either read the entire line (including the newline, perhaps using a ) and then process the first character of the line or simply add a test to skip newlines in your loop logic.P.S. Converting case by adding or subtracting 32 is a really awful approach. It won't work with anything but a-z and A-Z (in the English alphabet). It won't work for most characters outside the Basic Latin block and shouldn't be used at all for characters that have no alternate case (such as newline). You should be using and instead.
Unless you are able to demonstrate the problem with displayed code then I'm afraid there's not much more I can do to help you out.
@Colin Pickard: That's really sad :'( :'( :'(

Deleting files in Xcode does not delete them from installed apps/build folders/etc. It's extremely annoying. If you really want your app to only run in 3.5 inch mode, delete the Default-568 file and make sure to run Clean/Clean Build Folder in Xcode, and delete the app completely off your simulator/device. It should start showing up letterboxed again. Apple is still accepting 3.5in only submissions.

Add a dependency property to the - and when this changes, parse the CSV and add the data to the . See this question for a few pointers: By the way, a CSV of column names is a horrible interface! Why not expose a , then add a so that you can use a CSV string in XAML?

A module name is an , so it must normally start with a lowercase letter, unless you enclose it in single quotes. This is actually possible: But completely horrible, so don't do this.
How to set the default proxy for Internet Explorer in C# .net? I wanna make a browser capable of searching for a valid proxy in a .txt file and using it. The IP and Port used with the set default proxy command are valid however, the command itself does absolutely nothing. The only way I've found to use a proxy with a VS2013 .net browser is by adding it manually to IE which is incredibly useless.
no answer yet.... sad =(
Page/MasterPage/Control lifecycle makes me cry :(
I must investigate further, but I fear it's not : big precompiled pieces of middleware ahead !
The question on how to check input for validity is answered numerous times! You just check whether the stream is in a good state. If not, you'll reset the stream and ignore the character. Search for question where this answered. Also, don't use exceptions for non-exceptional cases and *always* throw something derived from `std::exception`: once you have tried to locate where an exception came from which isn't derived from `std::exception` in a program with a few million lines of code you'll find it extremely helpful to look at what `what()` returns!
Behaviour by tag, when you can just set a target action on a button directly? That's horrible!
Its not quick to do, but you can also run FXCop, and it will alert you to objects that are IDisposable that arent in a using() block. Working on some legacy C# code here at work, I found that whoever wrote it orgininally actually made a ".Dispose()" method is almost every class, even if not needed, but the classes don't actually implement IDisposable. Which means in intellisence they all have a Dispose() method, but can't be put in using() blocks... very annoying!
ouch. I have a large table, and the row by row insert is very painful

For someone who uses the Ctrl-W bindings in vim habitually, it is incredibly annoying to have Chrome OS ask me, "Wanna close this window, then?" How do I remap keys in Chrome OS? Can't find this top secret setting anywhere.
No. I cannot seem to be getting the module to work. Its really pain staking.
yeah, your pain is mine! This method described by ctrahey at least gives you some clue.
@JoranBeasley You're right for the new format though.. and I totally hate it :(
What is the difference between and similarly and It is really painful when i align the controls with and when i try to align in the Design mode it adds the , how to prevent auto adding property to a control while aligning it, as I already defined the to it why it doesn't update the same property.

@crush oh man would that be painful to query on!
@RobG - I hate IE! jQuery is my final weapon.
How can I get my Error, Logcat, Debug, etc. tabs to go back to the bottom-middle of Eclipse? For some reason, they moved up between the Package Explorer and the code editor in a vertical arrangement - I really hate it when sections of an IDE break off and dock to some seemingly arbitrary area.
I built an xml-rpc server in Python using SimpleXMLRPCServer, according to the example in the Python documentation. I'm calling it from a Python client on the same machine. The body of the server function executes very fast on its own. But I find that xmlrpc client performance is excruciatingly slow, taking one second per call. (Using xmlrpclib.) A speed-up technique I found on the web () didn't help. My connect URI is: I'm running Python 2.7 x64 on Windows 7, but it works the same for 32-bit Python 2.7.
I'm rethinking the design of my GUI. I designed a few JFrame with Netbeans automated GUI (yes, I'm lazy, and this generated code is often awful, I know !), but now I want them to be JPanel (actually, to inherit from another class that inherits JPanel). But I had the "setDefaultCloseOperation" modified, so my code is broken : setDefaultCloseOperation is impossible for a JPanel. Since I can't modify the generated code, I was wondering : is there a way to make Netbeans understand I changed my mind, and regenerate the code ?
I have a BufferedWriter to which I use to write characters into a PipedInputStream. Based on keyboard events. But I am implementing a backspace handler, but I can see no way of doing so without unputc. I am almost falling back into using a string to buffer the current line. Perhaps, I could do a better job using Canvas instead. (God how I hate java!)
I really hate when this happens.. I search and search for an answer and then I post a question. Then minutes later I find the answer.. The answer was on line 5.. this let me make the call.. I mean I get a pile of junk on the screen, but it doesn't fail... no exception.
Aye, the timer idea would result in horrible flickering for sure!
This code is scary :(
I have a big problem. I've created site, using jQuery, but it runs very slowly. On mobile phones it's terrible! And I don't know, what's wrong... Someone can help me?

Why do you not want to store it in the assets folder? That's what it's for. Regardless, you can't reference your local hard drive for it. (also, personal opinion, Monotype Corsiva is a horrible, horrible font) EDIT: So I would add, you should be able to do it the way you're doing it, you just can't use your local hard drive. Just get a reference to your TypeFace as a , depending on where you are saving them (e.g. ) and use .

Yes definately turn off that Solution Wide processing. It's a hog.
Is it to use the ViewData argument? As you already have seen that would be absolutely horrible. What I want to know is this: What is the recommended way to pass this sort of layout configuration to the partial view? By using a view model of course: and then: and then: and then: and then: and so on...
In my android app i'm trying to share an Open Graph including an object and an action. In my facebook app i added a story: and (is this ok?). When i try to add an image to the object in the OG i get above error. This is my code: here's the logcat: What am i doing wrong? Maybe i'm messing up some strings in the story, facebook tutorial is awful!
You could achieve all this with reflection but it would lead to a really horrible code. You'd better access individual members of the view model:

You have two divs, one over the other, and the one on top is transparent. However, when you scroll you want the div on the bottom to hide as it goes under the first transparent div. You don't want the second div's to change to as soon as it goes under the first div. You just want the part that is under to be hidden. I've googled extensively for an answer: #1-4 answer make the div on top or . The problem with this for me is my background is a photograph, i.e. as you scroll down what you see is different, as opposed to a colour or a pattern. The "background" of the transparent div needs to change as the real background changes. #5 offers a solution to this using JQuery however there are horrible, horrible issues with scroll lag in browsers not Firefox. Folks, how do I do it?
Not sure this answers the question accurately, what does everyone else think?
whatever generated this code is terribly broken!
When I apply on()-handlers I prefer the following notation if I have more than one to apply: Does anybody knows how to set a namespace within this notation? I solved the problem in this case with falling back to a single notation: But I really hate to repeat myself. Same issue/question for using the off()-method with more than one handler. This works: I bet the off()-thing is a easy one, but I don't get it after coding the last 15 hours.
I'm new to ror and am finding the scattered documentation extremely frustrating! When the commands rails generate model or rails scaffold are any fileds automatically created.

I have a controller which has a few actions, which are triggered by hitting various buttons on the page. I would like to have a default action, but am unsure how to annotate the method. Here is an example: How can I annotate a method which will act on a POST with any submit button pressed with no key selected? I have tried: I'd really hate it if I had to set required = false on each of the methods which take RequestParams and then conditionally check to see if one comes in or not... Is there a way to annotate this to work properly?
I am have used the remove data method to remove validation from the page. This works but throws an error in the console window and crashes with IE8 (I'm being forced to develop to this browser...sad I know!). Does anyone know how I can stop this error?

Im working with VB 2010 In the form designer, trying to position some controls within a tab control.

Okay .. after allot of trial and error I did something (complete desperation) and it worked! This is too dumb, and if it weren't for the fact that some other person might have the same issue I'd keep this to myself ..... I simply created a VerticalFieldManager that I added all the fields to, then added that VFM to the Screen. Point in fact this should NOT make any difference - at all - as the default Manager on a Screen is a VFM. Nothing else. No other properties set, methods called, events .... nada. Go figure.
my experience with SOAP is not good ): and documentation(at least in D2010) is extremely poor!

I have spent days trying to find any information or working samples on how I can get google data such as emails in my gmail inbox, list of my contacts, my calendar events etc... None whatsoever :( There are broken pieces of some code fragments here and there, 90% say it's been deprecated, is the a one single page on the internet that gives me a working example how to do that from javascript. Many pages about oAuth, but I have absolutely no idea how to use it , I have spent days reading broken pieces here and there, but I was unable to understand what that it and how I can use it PRACTICALLY. Very sad, and I am very tired to waste so much time on things that dont work and are not documented in human language, possible to understand. Why do they have to overcomplicate thing so much and spread broken pieces of information everywhere?
I really hate to give any pointers without explanation but i think your requirements are bigger ::: so --->

Indexed lookups in LinkedLists are O(n). That'd could be terrible for a 3d array!
The problem is that you never run the method, so the field stays at zero. It's a really terrible idea to give a field and a method the same name.

I am getting very strange flickering on a WPF application of mine. It only happens with alpha blended content, only on my computer, and only with WPF applications. At least I haven't noticed it with anything else. It's really annoying! Has anyone else dealt with this weirdness?
what I want to know is, what does create? what can I do with it? what does it mean? Every tutorial without fail will avoid talking about the first version entirely The reason the tutorial doesn't rell you what to do with it is that it really is totally useless! It allocates a single and gives you a pointer to that. The problem is that if you want an int, why don't you just declare one?
I am using Internet Explorer 11. Something annoying keeps happening when I add code to my site through the CMS form that I use. Take this line: Let's say I want to copy just this in IE, through the form on the page: When I go to copy just that section, it actually copies this: It is VERY annoying! It doesn't happen on Chrome or Firefox. For reasons with the CMS I have to use Internet Explorer. Is there a setting I can change so that doesn't happen? On Windows 7 if that helps. Sorry if this doesn't 100% fit with programming, someone let me know if there is a better place for this question.
Netbeans is showing all files and folders under /var/www/application/app/webroot/ as ignored, but that is not what is in the .gitignore file. Any ideas? This is incredibly annoying. Git version 1.7.9.5 Netbeans version 7.2.1 (Build 201210100934) Here is the ignore file:

I am sorry for posting so many questions, but getting this to work has been incredibly painful, even tho Testflight makes it much easier I figure this has got to do with my Apple Push Notifications. I am using my distribution profile across all my settings. My app has been configured to both development and production. What could the causes of this error be? As a side note, i have been working on this for the entire day, and i get stuck at one thing after the other, esp involving static libraries and xcode4. Am I really bad at this, or does Apple really make it so hard?
@Bukes: That's disgraceful :(
Very painful and doesn't work with inputs from the user.
What an awful Api!
We in the process of building an IOS app (it's yet to be launched). We are trying to implement Push Notifications as part of the build. We have set this up via Amazon SNS and have created and registered an app certificate for the app which contains push notification permissions. Basically we send the app message from Server code - it states that it has been published and it returns the message ID but the device doesn't receive anything. To clarify the device registers ok for remote notifications and returns a device token. Very frustrating! Does anyone have any tips?
The documentation for the minitest-ci gem (seemingly the only option for producing test results for a CI tool such as Jenkins) has the extremely annoying habit of not preserving the results of when invoked as - the test results from running minitest:models are deleted prior to running the rest of the tests. minitest-ci's barely-extant documentation claims adding this to test_helper.rb will disable the troublesome auto-clean behavior, but it doesn't: Has anyone out there managed to get minitest-ci to preserve all the test result files? I'm reaching wits' end here.
I have a custom UITableViewController class that is shared among a few ViewControllers of my app. I would like to do pre-emptive fetching before the user has hit the bottom of the page. However, I noticed that if the user scrolls up and then down again, my VC will trigger another fetching. So I came up with a flag isFetching which checks to prevent double fetching. Unfortunately I am running asynchronous code and I need a way to reset this flag after my fetching operation has completed. FeedVC: Delegate: I find it very painful to pass around a finish bloc in order to flip a boolean. does anyone have a better recommendation?
I agree, we often face this problem when using 10g XE databases, this is really annoying!
Triggering quirks mode is a terrible, terrible, terrible thing. In quirks mode, jQuery is forced to use alternative methods to interact with the DOM and is almost definitely the cause of your speed issues in IE.

that what i was afraid of ! cause my knowledge about ajax is zero :(
I'm sorry, but I didn't had an eye on this thread. I'm afraid the topic isn't hot anymore!?
I personally only use the 'm' and the 'p'. The rest is just zany in my view. It makes the code so darn hard to decipher. I did maintenance work on this guy's code who used semi-Hungarian notation type id prefixes on every variable, function, and other identifier in the code. He used $ signs liberally to separate words. It was hard to keep the murderous rage in check.
I just got through this exact problem. What a pain! If you are running a 32-bit JVM on a 64-bit Windows, make sure that you set the execution policy for the 32-bit Powershell interface. I found my 32 bit executable here: The 32- and 64-bit Powershell environments are completely distinct so setting the execution policy in one has no effect on the other.

is not an , it's a basic type. You can only add NSObject-derived objects to an NSArray. The EXC_BAD_ACCESS is probably because, under the covers, it's trying to access an object stored at wherever your int is pointing to. In other words, it's using your int as a pointer to an NSObject and failing horribly when it does so.
james, the stack trace under that is just my function name. Nothing more. very frustrating :(
The answer does not establish the same 's as adding directly to the ajax call. So in order for jQuery to do this properly I add this : where is a global variable. Unfortunately, I have to write this extra line on every single ajax call. Terrible! Maybe I'll edit the jQuery framework to handle this..
I've searched this and cannot find it. I've tried different plugins and different browsers (Firefox, Opera, and Chrome). I've tried most of the no flash plugins for each of those as well as disabling Flash plugins/addons in the settings. I also renamed the file in i found by searching the system. when i renamed it, makes Firefox and Chrome ask to install Flash, but still: returns: I'm not sure what else to try without uninstalling Flash, but that will be a total pain in the ass for this. I also REALLY don't want to use SWFObject just to see if Flash is at all installed which I can do simply with: Any ideas?
I am trying to generate API documentation via cabal and haddock. I want it to be latex. So I do: This fails ultimately with: Is there something I can do or is something wrong with haddock?

@sjdowling when downvoting someone you are suggested to explain why...
When you call "su" you're creating a new process that runs that command, so after running exec("su") you have a new process with SU rights. You can't give your already running application SU rights I'm afraid! I'm not sure how other applications do this, but you can run "su -l ls /data" and then read from the outputstream of the process.
One non-technical consideration. Embedding free data inside English phrases isn't going to look very smooth in many cultures (including Western ones), where you need grammatical agreement on e.g. number, gender or case. A more telegraphic style usually helps (e.g. Excellent input: "xyz") -- then at least everybody gets the same level of clunkiness!
Visual studio is ok, but i really hate the fact that you have to go through all the process of project creation just to compile one source file. Is there any compiler in windows that allows compilation directly from directory?

I have a function: Basically it just uses the plugin to nudge an image on mouseover to one slide and then another, to give the effect of a shake. I can see my code looks absolutely horrible, (I come from a php/c# background) can anoyone suggest a better means to achieve my goal?
No, and I would be very afraid if there was.
There is a way to fix everything, but you will still hate the autotools until the end of time!
@jozefg I'm really afraid of what you've told :(
Each tab in my xcode project can have navigation/debug/utility menus open. If I close those menus on one tab, then switch to the next, they may be open. This is really frustrating! If I want the menus closed, I want them closed on all tabs. How can I change this behavior?
Terrible approach, XML stores data, not formats!
I'm trying to run a Windows command in Python that requires admin access. I have figured out a way using runas, but it opens a User Account Control Pop-Up, which almost defeats the purpose of the automation and is really annoying! Is there any way around this? Here's my code for the admin command:

The following code to use results in black image no capture, why? Note that adding before capture has no effect! Googling has been completely useless for this case, so far!
I have a somewhat complicated issue. I have a grid defined (using the Struts2-JQuery Grid Plugin). One of the columns has a custom formatter that calls a Javascript function to put a button into that column. (Note: I absolutely HATE doing it that way). The point of the button is to open up a dialog box. This dialog box contains a checkboxlist, which can't be rendered in the grid. Somehow, I need to pass a parameter to the action that returns the view that will be displayed inside the dialog. Since this is somewhat complex, here is the code: Grid definition: Javascript Custom Formatter: Dialog Definition: Remote Manage Roles JSP (trimmed): Since I get the id of the grid object via javascript, but use the JSP taglib for the dialog, how can I pass the id around?
I absolutely hate that this exists, but there it is:

I'm running into extremely frustrating problems with Boost. When I try running something as simple as I get back: Why is this error occurring, and how do I make Boost.Lambda do what I need? (Yes, I'm aware I can use Boost.Phoenix et al. too, but that's not the point of the question.)

I hate it when a simple cosmetic change is invisible to me and causes my things to not work right but I forget about the change i made!
How come this is considered programming related?
I have an application where I need to adjust view position according to current focused subview (it's a list with focusable items, current focused item must be in the center of the screen - used for a tv application controlled from tv remote). Position must be adjusted with animation. I got it working with just one problem: if the user changes focus before the animation is complete (quickly taps "up" button twice) next animation starts with "jump" - it starts from the same position as did the first one. So what I try to do is I cancel previous animation and start another, but then new animation starts from the point where first animation was started, so user can see a very obvious jumps in the animation, which look really awful. Here's the code: So must question is: how can I start translate animation from the point where previous translate animation left on (assuming that it was cancelled)? Or, in a simplier words, how can I determine current visible rect of a view?
I have a serious problem which I can't a solution to. I need to authenticate a token in order to let the user login into my app, the problem is that even though I'm using the AsyncTask, and probably because of it, I can't authenticate it in time.

Android apps are constrained to a certain amount of memory. As it's quite (insanely?) low, I think you shouldn't feel guilty about using all of it! The limit is 16 MB on very old devices, 24 MB or 32 MB on newer ones. There doesn't seem to be much info on the size for different devices, and nobody seems to know why the limit is so small when modern phones have 1-2 GB of RAM. Aha, I found some concrete numbers on the limit: G1: 16MB Droid: 24MB Nexus One: 32MB Xoom: 48MB

I don't understand this part: One thing I've found with this is that passing the config around to all the other utility functions that I'd prefer and don't think should be a a part of one the the above mentioned classes can seem to get incredibly tedious. Anyway, look up on thread-local storage. You could make a singleton config object that is thread-local.
Horrible but linqy!
This makes me really sad.
I am writing a WsCF service to retrieve data for multiple clients. I have a service layer that references business manager objects. In essence on the service call, I want to retrieve the provider type (a custom enum in my code) and the connection string from the web.config. For some reason, the code is unable to find the settings in my project web.config. I am gathering the IIS Express AND the VS development web server are referencing the machine.config. How do I override this. It is extremely frustrating. As you can see from the snippet the setting AND the connection string name exist, but the code never picks it up. My code: Private Sub GetDBInformation() The web.config:

Nothing. Regex is something I have to learn. Javascript.. I hate it!
Sometimes, i get scared of the abilities of ````awk````!
Don't repost your blog posts.
Oh, how I hate TFS for giving me these headaches!
Freeing the local array "buffer" is undefined, and probably horrible, behavior! You can't free something unless it was allocated with malloc() or calloc(). It's likely corrupting the heap and causing the crash.
Just let IE6 flicker. I don't think it's worth it to invest time in a dying browser when your base functionality works well enough. If you're worried about flickering for accessibility reasons, just sniff for IE6 and replace the animation with a generic show() and hide() instead. I recommend avoiding complicated code for edge cases that don't matter.
Schemas - Okay, 2000 has owners, but they can be a real pain to get permissions right on.
I'm afraid I can't entirely follow your question - do you want to have a sign up form for membership or email notifications shown as an article? If so, then the easiest way is to install 'm2c' - the 'module to component' component. Then you can put any module (ie the sign up box) in the centre content area. The m2c component can be found here:
Trying to get S60 SDK working on Linux is quite a pain. Still struggling with that.
I wish i knew, I am on 3+ projects and have to do 3+ SCRUMS a day. :cry:
When specified as above, Spring distinguishes constructor arguments by order of appearance. The notation would only switch between setting the attributes by constructor to setting them by accessor. I'm afraid, this will not change anything.
I have two loops running in my code, I want to use an element from an array as the key in a second array, but am unsure how to do this with Smarty. "" contains an integer (pulled from the db) I want to use that value as the key in a second loop, which runs fine if I harcode in the integer: Pseudo code for the sort of thing I've been trying is: But of course, this doesn't work! Can anybody help?
If I plan to use data caching do I have to worry about conflicts when also using deferred loading? It seems that with linq i am losing control of my data.
Or, just use stack overflow and let Experts Exchange die a slow and painful death.
Every time I download the ZIP file it is corrupted!
Is it possible to hide .svn files in the Open Resource dialog (Ctrl + Shift + R) of Eclipse? It's very annoying when you have hundreds of files... Cheers.
This question is awfully vague.. and doesn't seem to have anything to do with programming..
Ignoring how ridiculously lame it is to ask a question and answer it in this fashion seconds later, this is an awful answer, and that is why it is voted down. Why will you only see a small speedup? Can you provide numbers? Platforms tested on? This answer is even more vague than the original question, which was vague to begin with.
Yes, we used to use Starling. But it's a pain to always delegate the stuff that could take awhile to a different process.
The 1024 byte limit is part of the syslog (section 4.1), as is UDP transport which doesn't have guaranteed delivery (in case you worry about log lines lost in the ether). I think syslog-ng can solve both these issues, but I'm not a syslog expert.
because it is terribly difficult to get right. But I mention `boost::iterator_facade`.
Link (burstproject.org) is inactive and seems to have reverted to horrible Go Daddy wall of links/ads.
Why do so many people not understand the importance of permanent URLs?? Even Adobe, selling products to build web applications, regularly fails at this!
In general, how expensive is locking in Java? Specifically in my case: I have a multi-threaded app in which there is one main loop that takes objects off a DelayQueue and processes them (using poll()). At some point a different thread will have to remove errant elements from the queue (using remove()). Given that the remove() is relatively uncommon, I am worried that locking on each poll() will result in slow code. Are my worries justified?
I know that IList is the interface and List is the concrete type but I still don't know when to use each one. What I'm doing now is if I don't need the Sort or FindAll methods I use the interface. Am I right? Is there a better way to decide when to use the interface or the concrete type?
Evil! Evil incarnate!
Makes sense, and it's very similiar to what I am doing. One ant task for stage and one for production, and just using the defaults for local development. But pain arises from mainting 3 different applicationcontexts which have almost identical content..
I understand its not a desirable circumstance, however if I NEEDED to have some kind of HTML within JSON tags, e.g.: is this possible to do in Python without requiring to to be escaped beforehand? It will be a string initially so I was thinking about writing a regular expression to attempt to match and escape these prior to processing, but I just want to make sure there isn't an easier way.
I've always been a bit frightened of Python. Is it not a relatively massive leap from an ingrained Web development mindset?
Hi all I have a horrid database I gotta work with and linq to sql is the option im taking to retrieve data from. anywho im trying to reuse a function by throwing in a different table name based on a user selection and there is no way to my knowledge to modify the TEntity or Table<> in a DataContext Query. This is my current code. I want to populate my ViewData with Enumerable records.
A unit test should do the same thing every time that it runs, otherwise you may run into a situation where the unit test only fails occasionally, and that could be a real pain to debug. Try seeding your pseudo-randomizer with the same seed every time (in the test, that is--not in production code). That way your test will generate the same set of inputs every time. If you can't control the seed and there is no way to prevent the function you are testing from being randomized, then I guess you are stuck with an unpredictable unit test. :(
I have a few classes which do nothing except in their constructors/destructors. Here's an example I'm a little concerned about future readability. Am I being too "tricksy" here, with a variable ("busy") which is never actually used in the code? Could some static analysis tool suggest they be removed, or is this idiom sufficiently common not to worry about?
Anyone else get this or suffer from this? I am using Vista and VS 2008 and when I goto open a Web Site it literally takes 2~3 minutes for the dialog box to show up. Once i actually select a website it's not a problem but getting to that point hangs VS really bad.
For what it's worth, NSCollectionView does this too (you can see it in action in the IconCollection sample code). They apparently wait for a "quiet period" in which you've stopped dragging. I've been trying to write a similar class, and it is definitely a pain to get the animations to run consistently and properly during the resize.
Won't that be horribly distracting?
Does it make sense to start learning JavaFx if I do not have any background in UI programming? Is it more advisable to learn Swing first and then move on to JavaFx ? I tried the on JavaFx website in Netbeans and the code looked extremely complicated to me. I am wondering if JavaFx is too advanced for a beginnner GUI developer.
Anti-JavaScript snobbery! Every language uses a separate platform on some level to parse and execute the code. JavaScript is just another language, capable of writing "programs" or "scripts".
@gnud: No, it's not an implementation detail. It makes it a pain when you've been given an integer in "natural" base (i.e. Jan=1) and you need to use it with the calendar API.
This is a stupidity of windows find utility, +1 for feeling my pain.
I'm only generating the AutoGeneratedClass. The GenericClass and its GenericHandler() method are hand-coded in a different assembly from the AutoGeneratedClass altogether. So I'm afraid this won't work.
This isn't worthy of an "answer", but I thought I'd mention: many of the interfaces I've really enjoyed have been minimalistic -- there's almost nothing for me to see. Like QuickSilver for OS X.
You should fix the libraries that are creating bad or non-named threads. I'd hate to debug your libraries' threads only to find that the names where changes elsewhere.
I have a query that has approx 20 columns and I would like to export this to an Excel file with the column headers. I thought this would be easy to figure out but no luck! I searched the web and found one suggestion that did not end up working so I am stuck. Anyone have any working ideas? Thanks,
Actually it's not as bad as it looks - Perl's File::Copy is horribly broken (for example it doesn't copy file permission on Unix and other stuff), so many "high profile" hackers actually use system('cp', $target, $destination) or similar stuff
8 hours? That's pretty quick! My last InnoSetup installation coding took TEN DAYS, and it still won't work right on Vista. It installed an app library, some sample apps, created a database, installed and started 2 windows services, and published a web site, but 10 days is still far too long...
I see that over on this question there is a request to say how to do something using LINQ to see if a property matches in a collection. However, is this the fastest reasonable process by which to do this? I will be deploying something that requires a certain amount of resource management, and I want the application to be as responsive as can be, without making the code terribly hard to decipher when someone else, or myself come back to it later.
I am extracting some data from SQL Server. One of the columns is a ntext column that has a blob of XML there. As I extract it, it looks really ugly. Is there any way to format the XML inside a SQL Server 2005 stored proc?
I am trying to build an application that can request files from a service running on another machine in the network. These files can be fairly large (500mb + at times). I was looking into sending it via TCP but I'm worried that it may require that the entire file be stored in memory. There will probably only be one client. Copying to a shared directory isn't acceptable either. The only communication required is for the client to say "gimme xyz" and the server to send it (and whatever it takes to ensure this happens correctly). Any suggestions?
I have a window using a WPF ListView/GridView bound to an ObservableCollection. The performance is utterly horrific. The application chokes trying to load 300-400 items and CPU usage spikes each time an item is added/removed/modified. Profiling doesn't reveal anything obvious. Anyone have any suggestions?
Can you be any more specific about the scenario you have in mind? "Optimization" is a terribly broad category.
Good luck! OCI is incomprehensible.
If you're debugging at the instruction level rather than the source level, it's an awful lot for you easier to map unoptimized instructions back to the source. Also, compilers are occasionally buggy in their optimizers. In the Windows division at Microsoft, all release binaries are built with debugging symbols and full optimizations. The symbols are stored in separate PDB files and do not affect the performance of the code. They don't ship with the product, but most of them are available at the .
I have no answer, but I'll 2nd the sentiment about the documentation quality for OpenSSL... I'm working with it now also (just starting), and it's horrible trying to find examples or documents for anything beyond simple operations... I feel your pain.
that's some very dangerous advice!
rmeader: if you have clients who can barely restart their computer it is a pain. And from what I heard some versions of windows don't automatically synch time ...
Shortcut keys often don't work the same way across all browsers. And they are awful on Opera. And most users won't use them. The only thing I'd bother with on most sites is buttons for next and prev, and I'd also make the alt tag say "next" or "previous" to assist browsers with fast forward.
+1 for the /f I've written couple of scripts for that but without /f it was such a pain; required me to be there when running the script to type "y+[return]"
Linked lists have operations which a FIFO queue does not (enumerate the list, remove items from the middle, etc). So personally, I'd fear that if a list is used as a queue without encapsulation, then in future some fool (probably me) will fail to observe the FIFO constraint.
i hate being that guy, but this is really not the way to do whatever you aretrying to do
I'm trying to pull the whole set of objects that I want to work with into memory so I can cut down on calls to the database. If I call a SELECT for each iteration I'm looking at hundreds of thousands of calls, which is running horrifically slow.
Perhaps I am missing something, but I am just learning javascript. My understanding of Single Origin Policy is that Google Analytics should not be able to send data back to Google. How is it able to transmit send data to Google without violating the policy?
I've tried several other IDEs (the last one was eclipse) but always come crying back. The thing I end up missing most is homesite's 'tag insight' for all the html tags.
Link is now dead :(
I completely disagree with the answers so far. I feel that internal is a horrid idea, preventing another assembly from inheriting your types, or even using your internal types should the need for a workaround come about. Today, I had to use reflection in order to get to the internals of a System.Data.DataTable (I have to build a datatable lightning fast, without all of its checks), and I had to use reflection, since not a single type was available to me; they were all marked as internal.
I had to do this once in Notes for a plugin I was developing. What I ended up doing was editing the Notes template in the designer, and then writing some LotusScript behind it that called a .NET class via a DLL. So when you clicked the button, it triggered the event in the LotusScript, and then called the DLL, and passed the item information to it. I should also note that it was a freakin' bear to figure out because Notes documentation is terrible.
Would one be violating the the terms of agreement with Google App Engine if one were to use Amazon's S3 service with Google App Engine? I do know there is restrictions on what you can and can't do but I was not sure of this. Having these two combined features, one could provide one heck of a system at a relatively low cost compared to hosting this with a hosting company. Has anyone done this already or have heard of an application that combines the two technologies?
I have a web page that renders the same in IE7, Firefox, and Safari - except when printing. IE7 appears to allocate too much space for borders when printing. In the example below, the box heights plus borders should add up to the same height in the 2 columns. I set the borders to 10px to exaggerate the problem. I hate CSS hacks, and so far I've been able to create my pages without them. Any suggestions?
Unfortunately some projects require hundreds of images for CSS, general site images and flash then there can be hundreds of PDF's, Docs which are needed for the site. Including them can mean it takes ages to load a project and sync it. If your unlucky enough to use VSS then this is far more painful.
Managing url paths can be a real pain in ASP.NET. AbsolutePath vs RelativePath vs etc. drives me crazy. I find that many solutions require the user to edit web.config element to include the correct subfolder path; ex. Website Root: Web.config setting: / Website Root: web.config setting: /blog/ Is there a way to properly handle this without having to make changes to the web.config?
I am currently a college student and I don't feel that any of my classes have touched on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) nearly enough. I've been interning a company for a few years and I've been learning about SDLC from the internship, but I wanted to poll the crowd so I can branch out from that. What SLDC resources (books, websites, magazines, newsletters, etc.) do you use?
Unless there is a very valid reason, passwords should hashed. Hashes result in fixed length strings. There is not space argument to make, unless the system is storing the actual password, which is arguably a terrible idea.
I have several hundred (static - no includes or server-side parsing) HTML pages. I would like to validate the HTML (XHTML 1.0 Transitional), but the idea of plugging each of them individually into the W3C Validator - or even using a Firefox plug-in to open each one - fills me with dread. Does anyone know of any (Windows) apps that can do bulk validation? The "Validate entire site" feature on is the closest I've come, but that's limited to 100 pages.
Start with Master Pages on day #1 - its a pain coming back to retrofit.
I am looking to make a phone call from software and have the software read a message to the recipient. I have been using Asterisk, but have found it somewhat are to maintain and it was a pain to configure. I'm wondering if there are any services where you can send it a piece of text and a phone number and it will read it to the recipient of the phone call. I am in Canada and making calls within Canada. The service does not need to accept calls. I am working with an AMP server.
Everything in the terminal buffer. Command history is easy, just 'history'. Sometimes there's an exception or a log I want to grab, but it went off the screen or select-all is a pain. I want to make a cmd line tool that does it and maybe sends it to a new gist.
Poor Steve just got screwed over by people not reading what he wrote correctly. I hate it when that happens, but I can understand why they read it the way they did. You left the statement rather ambiguous.
Sad that you had to preface with "Reasons for doing this aside" in order to prevent a flame war or such...
I don't use IronPython, but what I've read so far about it does not certify the "incredibly bad python implementation" [typo fixed].
I'm trying to delete several working copy directories, but I get an Access Denied on all the SVN files, running as admin or normal user. I've killed the Tortoise cache process, and cannot figure what is wrong. Any suggestions?
This is horrible. First you're sleeping, which will never wait exactly the right amount of time. It may fail if the computer is busy and shutdown takes longer than expected. And otherwise it will waste time. Furthermore, you're using shared *persistent* state. The right solution is simply to free the `runOnce` mutex before calling `Application.Restart()`.
Lambdas automatically 'suck' in local variables, I'm afraid that's simply how they work by definition.
How do I stop a browser refresh from happening when a flash object has focus inside a pop up window? Yes, I abhor pop up windows too. Yet we have a flash questionnaire that is being wrecked from users who use refresh. I also already have js in place that effectively blocks refresh, UNTIL the flash gets focus and the user presses refresh. I have access to the Flash through our Flash developer, but he is uncertain of how to do this. The closest we could come up with was to use the fscommand trapallkeys, yet it does not appear to be working.
(For the record, I find the Infragistics WinForms controls to be considerably easier than their ASP.NET controls. I think a lot of their bad rep comes from the ASP.NET side of the world, where certain tasks become a major pain and their Viewstate usage is off the charts.)
Also be aware that as a programming language TeX is most awful, the worst language in real use I've come across.
With no offense, just as one developer to another, I'm afraid that your idea seems terribly inefficient. It seems to me that instead of uniting SQLite databases you should probably be storing several tables within the same Database file. However if I'm mistaken I guess you could ATTACH the databases and then use a VIEW to simplify your queries. Or make an in-memory table and copy over all the data (but that's even worse performance wise, especially if you have large databases)
@ravenspoint: If you want to create the object on the heap now and delete it after execution in an other thread, I should probably remind you of RAII -> very bad programming style!!! Or do you want to make some silly synchronisation to ensure the data is

I hate it none of the specified answers worked for me....
Since I am completely useless at regex and this has been bugging me for the past half an hour, I think I'll post this up here as it's probably quite simple. In PHP I need to extract what's between the tags example:
I'm not sure I follow what you mean by "service layer"... "service" is such an abused generic term these days :-(
Yep, the power tools SHOULD let you do this, but unfortunately the merge goes horribly wrong each time so it's next to useless.
I don't know any opensource solutions, and the guys writing this stuff for money can't and won't tell you. Guess you're out of luck :]
First of all I can't see object locking, unused lockObject variable makes me sad. IEnumerable is not special. Each thread will have it's own copy of reference to some instance of sektioner object. You can't affect other threads that way. What would happen with old version of data pointed by sektioner field largely depends on calling party.
Enlightenment DR16 is packaged with openSUSE 11.1 but it's a bit painful to use with KDE apps as there's no obvious (on the Enlightenment site, google etc.) way to provide a systray for KDE apps that require one (e.g., ktorrent). Anyone know of a way around this? I'm not using e for the eye-candy - I'm running on a 2.6GHz Celeron and KDE (4.1) performance isn't exactly stellar so I'm trying out a few alternatives.
FF @ fault? Damn... hate when my buddy fails me.

Most DNS servers don't obey RFC1912 to be honest. Its a sad thing about ISPs.
If you are concerned about code re-ordering you are either creating some funky and hard to understand and maintain code, or else you probably don't need to worry about it. Can you explain why you think the code snippet you supplied will be reordered?
Since you're testing legacy code I'm assuming you can't refactor said code to have less dependencies (e.g. by using the ) That leaves you with little options I'm afraid. Every header that was included for a type or function will need a mock object for that type or function for everything to compile, there's little you can do...
Herbert's answer is a suggested way of marginally automating the browser to check the boxes and click the delete button. If one was to setup a browser automation project with Selenium or such, then this would be a legitmate but painfully slow solution to delete all entities via the admin screen as it only deletes at most 20 entities at a time.
I hate to say it, but constant polling over HTTP is the poor mans solution.
I don't want to do anything fancy on Twitter except post to it via my site once a day. I have searched around a bit and there are all sorts of super-complex ways to do every little thing that Twitter does, but there seems to be little documentation on how to do the simplest thing, which is make a post! Does anyone know how to do this? Or can you at least point me in the right direction? I don't need full wrappers or anything (), just one simple function that will post to Twitter. Thanks!
I'm apologize for saying this, but the code you've posted is simply awful and needs desperate refactoring. Create a class to represent 7 properties instead of 7 parallel arraylists, and use String.split to parse a comma-seperated list.
Is there any way to have a statement across multiple lines without the underscore character? It is really annoying in multi-line strings such as SQL statements, and especially LINQ queries. Beside from the ugliness and difficulty when changing a line (nothing lines up anymore) you can't use comments in the middle of the multi-line statement. Examples of my daily personal hell.
unfortunatly most browsers think window.close() is malicious and don't allow it to close itself without at least prompting the user :(
such a strong argument without any "reference", is completely useless because just opinionated.
I am about to alter the several tables in a massive system which I probably only understand around 10%. I want to add three columns. One of these is just a rename of an existing column. Part of me wants to :- Rename the column but worried about the impact on unknown parts of the system that use the old name. Append the three columns to the table therefore making the old column redundant (over time).
That's what I was thinking, but I am afraid it will bring confusion to the structure. I will need to add "Set children" field to parent class which should not be used anywhere in the code, only for hibernate cascade deletion. Do you think it is ok?
Can somebody point me to a resource that explains how to go about having 2+ IIS web server clustered (or Webfarm not sure what its called) ? All I need is something basic, an overview how and where to start. Can't seem to find anything...
Eruby is an external executable, while erb is a library within Ruby. You would use the former if you wanted independent processing of your template files (e.g. quick-and-dirty PHP replacement), and the latter if you needed to process them within the context of some other Ruby script. It is more common to use ERB simply because it is more flexible, but I'll admit that I have been guilty of dabbling in eruby to execute files for quick little utility websites.
So for my text parsing in C# , I got directed at YAML. I'm hitting a wall with this library I was recommended, so this is a quickie. And so on. Is that valid?
iâll try this. string needs to be iterable. and while we are at it: how come java is so damn awful? no sane person would specify `remove` in an interface, just to add `throws UnsupportedOperationException - if the remove operation is not supported by this Iterator`.
My guess would be from a colleague who wanted to scare this person out of ever using 'this' again. It can be fairly annoying when someone uses 'this' for every single thing they do. Not that it justifies lying to a new programmer, but I can imagine someone doing this out of frustration.
Whatever you do, make sure that you don't use Apache's DBCP. It's a horrible implementation that will actually cause performance problems, not fix them.
@Andy: Give him the Useless Use Of Cat award!
That's depressing :/ Are you sure I can't get a collection of all controls on the page with a particular class and give them a single data source?
I have a table that is referenced by a ton of other tables via foreign keys. I am trying to delete a Document record, and according to my execution plan, SQL Server is doing a clustered index scan on every one of the referencing tables. This is very painful. I thought having a FK automatically made an index on the FK fields? Or am I wrong? Do I really have to go around my database putting an explicit index on every single FK field?
The current solution i implemented is awful! I use a for inserting records from an ADO.NET data-table into an SQL table. I would like to insert at once the data-table into the SQL table, without iterating... Is that possible, or am i asking too much?
If double logins presented, it skipped it... looks so terrible))
Don't have access to any other versions here I'm afraid :(
To be honest I don't even know where to start. I guess the solution might entail using a zillion IIf statements. I'm fairly new to this I'm afraid!
whenever i drag-n-drop a stored procedure onto my Context canvas, the parameters/arguments for the stored procedure are all nullable. Why is this? Is it because of how i've declared my parameters inside the stored procudure itself? Besides manually creating my stored procedure methods in the Context partial class (or drag-n-drop onto canvas, cut from autogen'd code, move to partial class, then remove nullables types) .. is there any way to fix this? It's really frustrating :(
Nope - gave up and went for a completely non-Ruby solution.
It's HORRIBLE! No, seriously, I don't like it.
worried about IE compatibility!!
The problem is that you never run the method, so the field stays at zero. It's a really terrible idea to give a field and a method the same name.
Arrrghhh, how I hate those people who downvote answers without leaving a comment as for why the downvote...
Dude, you scare me! At least make an effort in PROVIDING CODE!
When I refactor the following line: using Resharper's "Use Object Initializer", I get the following: I really hate this type of formatting because with longer object names and variables it just gets out of control. How can I get Resharper to do the following?

This is a professional project in academia and I need to use Java for it - bc of my own limitations I'm afraid!
So, the following hack seems to work, but it's really incredibly ugly IMO, as it relies on you controlling the line-height and using absolute positioning. Worse, it requires you to know how many lines there are in your text, which depends on the width of the div and the font-size, and probably requires JS to compute.Anyway, after all the above disclaimers, here's the hack: Use two divs with the same text, one on top of the other. One justified, one centered. Then clip the justified one.HTML CSS Fiddle.Of course, the above code is hard-coded for the specific width. Again, you'll probably need JS in order to compute the number of lines in the div. I'm pretty sure that until this gets implemented in Webkit you probably won't find an elegant solution for your problem.
I was afraid of that!
Sorry, I wasn't clear. You would need to add that as a BOOL property on your class. It originally sounded as if you had a single place that handled the notifications and displayed the errors.
I use the gem for transparent usage of Memcached. Using the supplied config file it is enabled on all modes (development, test, production). Is there a way to only activate cache-money in production mode? It's not immediately clear how to do this, and it's a total pain dealing with caching in development mode.

Most of the times when Iphone program crash, compiler show stack with full of no's, but these no's don't make any sense to me. Very rarely it point out where the problem might be and mostly there are these useless no's. How you can make sure that when your program crashes while development/testing, it shows at what place this cause this crash?
Ok this is really annoying, can't find a solution that works !
We are working in real estate project, there we have image and video uploads in many places. We are started with in few places, But now we found an issue that it does not work if the flash player not installed in the browser. Its working only after installed the flash player in browser. This is really worrying. We should not force user to install flash player to upload images/video. How to handle this issue?

I am having trouble with adding text to the RichTextBox with tabs in it. I have code similar to this: And when I do this I can see tabs in paragraphs that start with '\t' but if I actually delete the tab then press the Tab key, the indentation is wrong. In fact it's about half the size exactly. Also if I tab in the middle of a line the tabbing is different. Also when I pull the Text out of the TextRange lines that start with tabs appear to not generate '\t's generated by pressing the Tab key. This is incredibly frustrating. Does anyone have advice or ideas how to work with this?
yes another reason to hate IE!
`cat $(find $FOLDER -name "*.txt")` that's terrible!

Unfortunately the SMBIOS UUID is not unique on all systems. It should be but it isn't. This is not because of a failure in the specification of the SMBIOS UUID, but is due to the fact that many manufacturers don't follow the spec when creating this UUID. For more information about how this goes wrong in practice see this Intel blog and the following instructive tale has some really awful examples from the real world: . By the way there is another more informative topic on stackoverflow about creating machine unique id's at
I really hate that object...
In Bash, you use parameter expansion: In your case, say . No need to go overboard and cry for regexes at the slightest provocation -- Bash has plenty of power!
Its really sad :( to hear "We cann't fix Footer or Header view".. it always get scroll with rows.
I am trying to figure out why foundation is acting differently to expected behaviour. If you look at the Kitchen Sink page for foundation, the default styles for secondary buttons hover affect is different to what I get if I set foundation up in rails. Note these images are from my rails application Image 1 - look at the '.tiny.secondary' button - no hover Image 2 - look at the '.tiny.secondary' button - with hover However on the page for foundation the color does not transition to the primary colour of the site. It transitions to a darker shade of grey. Have I missed some setting? Really frustrating me! I am guessing this is a bug in foundation
very sad, for erlang programmers :(
strange error. One of which i cannot find any existing resources to solve the issue. The issue is, when using I get pointed to a folder at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DevServer\10.0". Naturally, this breaks everything which depends on the correct folder (the one my solution is actually in) being given. What is more strange is that there exists a unit-test to make sure that this path at least has the correct root folder and sometimes it will pass and will be working as expected, and then the very next debug, will point to the aforementioned folder again. Very confusing and very annoying ! Any ideas ?
On Win with MSVC there's but it's really horrible and you don't want to use it if you can possibly avoid it. Better to say that there are no exceptions.
Holy thread abuse, Batman!
As Alexander said, you are comparing a string and a char. The sad thing is that the compiler already told you that, only it encrypted it in ISO-STL-TEMPLATE encryption, which is more difficult to read that perl! You may want to look at for decrypting C++ STL error messages.
How do I change the position of the sort button in header of the grid in Tapestry 5? I have column names of different lengths and I break lines on spaces, so the button, which is appended to the end of the column names, always ends up in different height. And that is very ugly :(
In addition to firebug (which should be your first port of call), the will also tell you where a given style is sourced from, just in case IE - shock, horror - should be different.
So only workaround which works for me is to add this js to template of my site..But its really awful solution, since I only need it in one article/module
I really hate this option. I am looking at managing this by GPO in my org.
So, I'm trying to make a 3D grapher for a class. Right now I'm working on understanding OpenGL and I'm failing horribly. I want to move the camera, but I can't at all, whatsoever. Why doesn't this work?
Afraid not! If I do so then it explicitly looks for quotes within the data, which it doesn't have.
For SQL Server 2005, I ALWAYS had to install the full product first, then Express second. If I did it the other way around, the full SQL install would see Express installed already, and would not continue with the install. It was extremely annoying. Not sure if they fixed this with 2008.
I also fail to get webgl to work on mac osx. Really frustrating! osx 10.9 mac book pro
I want to bulkload my cassandra data from node A to node B. when I set the 'listen_address' of each cassandra.yaml file to localhost, they do not show error on console but the data is never transmitted. when I set each node's listen address to their own local network[eth1 ipv4]address (192.168....), I get the following error. I can read from this error log that the application is trying to access to port 1..4 and I do not have no idea what on earth is going on. each node is on the virtual machine on the Virtual Box Hypervisor. Both OS is centOS. Here is my cassandra.yaml (the cassandra.yaml of target file is also configured the same way) thrift_max_message_length_in_mb: 16 Can anybody give me advice? I am really suffering as hell.
Is there any way to quickly jump to a scene in a storyboard? I have about 30 different scenes/view controllers and it has become incredibly tedious to locate the view controller I'm trying to edit.
So to do this I would keep a list of axes and when I delete the contents of one I would swap it out with a full one. I think the example below solved the problem (or at least gives an idea of how to solve it): The extremely ugly for loop construct is really just a placeholder to give an example of how the axes can be swapped.
Ended up being a bad dependency. I had to add it manually to get it all working. Terrible!
there is no IDE work on my computer just devc++ and turboc and the two is too bad i want vc++ express or netBean c++ but nothing work ! i don't know why but i hate this situation it's too bad !:(
You could implement it using `goto`'s (the horror!)
This is one thing that I really hate within development is forms. Below is my code and what I am trying to do is align the inputs with the labels . Is there a rule that you use to help remember when coding forms? CSS: HTML:
We are running Jenkins on a server that does not have internet access (even through proxy). Installing and keeping the Jenkins installation up-to-date is a pain! My idea was to make a local mirror of the complete Jenkins public update-site through a Windows workstation that has internet access. And then make this local mirror available to Jenkins through NFS share. So my questions: How to make the local mirror? Do you have a better/simpler idea to keep the Jenkins installation up-to-date?
this api stinks, it is terribly designed and has lots of bugs!
I created public and private key with cygwins ssh and pasted the public key into bitbucket account. says the ssh connection works fine! (so it should work!!!) Then I post into mercurial.ini in TortoiseHg And I post Into the hgrc file. But then when I want to push TortoiseHg says to me: Seems to me something is missing here but what exactly? Edit: I don't want to used TortoisePlink because it is SUPER SUPER SUPER SLOW! And https just cancels the connection after uploading several megabytes.
Oh, how I hate iframes!!!
Extremely lousy solution.
that made me cry :'(
The really sad thing is I could do this in about 5 lines of Ada code...
There's always the poor man's alternative of just loading a bajillion individual frames as .gif/jpg/png and having javascript display them in sequence. It would be absolutely horrible for bandwidth and memory usage, and of course no audio, but it would (somewhat) simulate video being played. Of course, on Windows platforms, you could use ActiveX and/or embed media player and play avi/wmv files as well, without ever touching flash.
@delnan I was worried about !! and -, not function application.
No, they've stopped working again and gone back to the 403 forbidden message. Incredibly annoying.
Has anyone found a way to change the icon displayed in the Office Button in A2007? Having converted an MS Access 2003 app to 2007, it's very annoying that my app is now displayed as an MS Office app instead!

An example: Extremely frustrating!
Ok, here's one way of doing this, but it's terrible! I'm still looking for an easier way:
I really hate thinking that code can tell me how to think instead of me telling it what to do ... anyway ... here is an example for loading the controller rendering the page, and it can load any controller inside the helper. EDIT: just realiced this is such an old post :( ... this is working in cakephp 2.2.3
I'll bet you that your main's function signature is incorrect. You use: but SDL_main.h wants Aside: You see, SDL does something really horrific when compiling: It renames your function to , injecting its own main function which, in turn, calls yours. Note that if this doesn't work, then you may be compiling with wrong flags. To be sure, take the flags by running: For more information, see
Well, you could play around a bit... What about a function that rewrites itself? Warning: This is extremely ugly and should not be used in production code!
thatÂ´s really sad :(
Im getting really depressed over this so I could really use some assistance. I created a new project in visual studio. I first created a new header file, called "MyString,h" and placed it in the header folder. It contains a class called String. you can see the code I used for it at the end of this I also now have a MyStringTest.cpp file in the source files folder. It has the following code in it. Expected: Compiles and runs a console program which will output "llo" Reality: Error: 'Identifier 'String' is undefined Here is some of my code in the header file...i really cant fit all of it. ....
Right ... if only I was using SQL server.. Informix unfortunately :( :( :(

I'm having an extremely frustrating error trying to code a simple encryption program on Python 2.7. Basically its rejecting on if/else statement by saying my syntax is invalid, and I have no idea what I did wrong. The : in the if input =="1": statement is what Python highlights as incorrect.
I'm in the UK, a long way from Beijing i'm afraid!
Regexes are fraught. A regex that splits parameters on commas will get awfully confused if one of the parameters is `\"Hello, world!\"`.
The other day I noticed that if I run IEInspector's HttpAnalyser and capture the post data when logging into my bank account or amazon account the post data shows my user name and password in the clear. This is a little concerning. Does anyone know at what point the SSL encryption takes place? This I assume would mean that any software that is installed on your machine could potentially get access to this post data. Very scary.
I am trying to change a bit-map's pixel color if it's white. I wrote following code. But it's awfully slow!. i want to check if a pixel's color is white or not, and if it is white, change the color to black. Can anybody suggest a better approach?
it is being deprecated because it is old and unsafe. switch now or feel the pain later!
This is probably caused because you have set to (Which is absolutely terrible). (See ) You should disable register globals so that the SESSION/POST/GET/REQUEST/COOKIE variables do not interfere.
Anyone??? I'm starting to hate VS for that reason!
Getting the ssrs add-in to install properly was a complete pain. I think it had to do with the fact that we did development on the server prior to installing the ssrs add-in. I ended up un-joining the farm, re-joining it, then installing the component. That got it to work. Then I just had to re-deploy solutions, re-activate features and re-configure my web.config.
I'm very sad now :(

That `#define n 10` is scary :( Are you sure you don't intend on using that letter anywhere else?
That's a really terrible way to read in all your files. Try this: This will return a list of data frames, each of which is the contents of the corresponding file. Or, if there are other csv files that you don't want to read in, you can restrict the specification: And to combine everything into one big data frame:
I am not familiar with Python scripting. I am simply trying to create a small GUI that will allow me to alter a parameter in an ArcGIS Model using the Tkinter Scale and then run the model by clicking a TKinter Button. (The code below is not finished and is being used for testing purposes, hence the button does not actually call a different script yet). I get this TypeError in the Traceback: I have tried deleting many different things from my code to determine what these arguments might be but to no avail. It is incredibly frustrating as I am sure it is the most simple problem. My code is as follows:
Off topic, but I really really hate the 5 ` `s in a row. That's abuse!
This has nothing to do with but everything to do with the absolutely awful markup of your HTML and the lack of . You're going to want to wrap all of this "free-text" inside of a or two, and then make sure you're putting the inside of the Sample CSS: HTML:

This is a method in Java, that(when k == 0) in int[] arr has one of k-combination int[] intems. In variable iloczyn is calculated product of elements in this combination. In tmp is calculated sum of all such products. Unfortunately, System.out.println(tmp) shows, that when function ends, tmp equals 0. This is very sad, because i need this variable for next calculations. What shoud I do?

I have a Django application built in our shop and currently we are moving to production that will run a apache web server. The application will run on multiple webservers Due to load issues. Now, I'm really worried since it's running multiple webservers. Issue - The application generates unique ids for session management and maintains it locally. Now, if a user goes to webservers-a and creates A unique id and then in the next request goes to webservers-b he will be invalidated because the unique id created for him will be local to webservers-a. How can I fix this issue?
@Kolink Oh, I hate Facebook for many more reasons!

I've changed the color scheme on sublime text 2 and I really hate the colors it changed to. So what is the name of the default settings? Because I want to change it back to the standard.
Have created a module in DotNetNuke 7. Have made changes on my local test version which has created several rows in the database. I then copied these rows into the live database but they dont appear in the live version of the module. Have tried clearing the cache through host settings and restarting the application and it still won't show new rows. Have even tried setting cache settings to non-specified and still won't load new rows. Is there a way I can completely reset and get it find the new rows. This is an extremely irritating feature.
I'm calling onto some code that returns me an HTTP response. I can get the contents of the response which returns me a byte array. The bytes represent a zip file that I would like to extract and get the contents of a single file (the zip only contains one file). Currently I have some messy code (I'll need to clean it up if I keep it) that seems to work: but was wondering whether there was a cleaner way to do the same thing because the above looks incredibly ugly.
It's technically possible to achieve this in T-SQL with nested loops and embedded queries. All hugely ugly in T-SQL. Far easier to do it in a language that's more general purpose.
I'm trying to debug my application and from the point I fire it up on the iPad, it will get killed by timeout before it ever reaches FinishedLaunching() (I have abreakpoint there)! Here' swhat I see in the output panel. All this takes almost 20s. If I run the app in RELEASE build it randomly gets stuck. I hit a button and the delegate gets caled half a minute later. What is going on? In the Simulator it is all okay.
I have been trying to use OfflineAudioContext and the FFT analyzer in chrome with a script processor but I am running into the same issue that this person has: In that SO answer, someone pointed out this bug report: but it is over a year old! My questions are: does anyone know if this will be fixed anytime soon and should I file a bug elsewhere? Is that bug report (that is a year old) still being looked at? Or better yet, maybe someone knows a workaround? My code is essentially the same as the jsfiddle on that SO link. It's really sad that this stuff doesn't work in chrome but it does in Firefox.
In the end the answer was - yes - indeed. It was simply a delay between me adding my google test account and it actually being recognised as such :@! Google should have a warning about this - in-app billing is a complete nightmare to code!
I'm very worried about the following screen. When i launch "Instruments" in Allocations mode, i see every image of my app adding to "Living". I really don't understand how it could be possible...
I guess I could do that. It's just a pain when in Microsoft Word I can hold down shift and drag to do this, but I can't in Visual Studio!
So I have also ran into this problem. I have found a solution(it's terrible, be warned!) Open Unity and load your solution in MonoDevelop 4.0.1 (older version you can set the target framework more easily) Navigate to your project directory and open "Assembly-CSharp-vs" in notepad. Change the line "TargetFrameworkVersion" v3.5 to "TargetFrameworkVersion" v4.0 You will have to do these steps every time you load Unity(blah) but it does work.
I was getting the same error when I tried to submit a version update from the Organizer. What solved my issue was using the Application Loader found in the directory /Developer/Applications/Utilities. You'll need to compress your .app file and send the corresponding .zip file. I used this for my initial submission as well, I just thought I'd try the new way. What a pain! Go with Application Loader.
Too slow and I prefer to operate in the same mode as my users. Also, I just really hate switching to debug. And its a waste of diskspace.
$('li:nth-child(3), li:nth-child(4)').insertAfter('ul').wrapAll('')You can't "break a list". You can either A) remove it and replace it with two lists B) extract some elements to make another list with. The following is terrible terrible practice, but then again so is what you're asking...

From netstat -anp | grep I at two different times, I can see HttpClient is not re-using my connections. I connect to the same host every time with different urls such as Why is HttpClient not just re-using the same connection to myhost.com every time? I have the following code for intialization of the Pool that I pass to HttpClient... I see they are using an HttpRoute and have localAddress in the equals which seems odd as HttpRoute should be equal on just hostname and schema(https/http) and that is it, right? Does that have something to do with it? Is this a bug? Performance is very crappy having to re-establish https sockets every time!!!!!

I have a VB.NET MDI WinForms app. My users have been complaining about form creep (as they call it), this is where each time you open a specific form within the main MDI window it opens slightly below and to the right of the location it loaded previously - i.e. it starts in the top left of the window and works its way down to the bottom right. I have to agree with them that this is extremely irritating, is there any way to prevent this? The code to load the forms is: I can address this somewhat by setting the forms start-up positions to 'Manual' but then they just open directly on top of each other in the top left of the screen. Any other SO users come across this?
I'm using this practice to add comments using AJAX , by sending the data to an ASP.NET Handler which collect the information and then insert the comment, but I am afraid that any one could use it , am I wrong !?

The objective of my endeavour is to have a linux computer execute a command (or maybe a local script - on the target) over a local network. Ideally, I would use SSH to do this but unfortunately my embedded target is running WinCE which is absolutely horrible. To do this, I would require an SSH server running on WinCE. I looked into the OpenSSH port but it doesn't work and development for that stalled six years ago. To wrap up, I am looking for an alternative solution to using SSH on WinCE. So, any ideas?
You could use an incredibly ugly workaround and set a form full of hidden fields to submit when you click a link. I really wouldn't recommended it though.

I have just about finished adding all of the content to each page of my website. I've noticed, however, when I navigate between links some of the pages shift to the right about 10 px or so. This is extremely irritating. All of my pages are contained within the same container using a fluid grid. However, not all pages have the same amount of content. I noticed that pages with empty divs don't shift when I navigate between them. However, if I navigate from a page with content to a page with little or no content, I see the shift. Should this be happening if all of my pages are using the same container, same fluid grid? Does this make sense? Can you sense my desperation?
Oh God, I remember this, it was absolutely horrible. Worse, I can't remember how to fix it offhand.
This makes me very, very sad.
Our QA team uses HP Quality Center for defect tracking, test plans, etc. The dev team really detests Quality Center and wants to use JIRA for internal task tracking. Can these two systems work seamlessly together? I have worked on projects where 2 teams used separate issue-tracking systems and keeping them in sync was a major headache. Anyone have real-world experience integrating Quality Center and JIRA?

Visual studio crashes as soon as I open aspx or ascx View from MVC 2.0 project. If I delete all bin and obj folders from projects, I can open aspx and ascx View page.

I'm using Visual staudio 2008 Sp1. MVC 2.0, Window xp sp3. .NET 3.5 sp1. Anyone can help?
Did you ever solve this problem? I've just come across it and it's really annoying, especially because my video doesn't even have audio!

XCode 5.0 Console Not Showing After Exiting App and Reopening. I put a simple NSLog in the next screen that I push to and there is no logging of it in my console. This makes it a pain to debug! I segue from one screen to a tabbar controller, if that helps? Has anyone encountered this issue?
I have an Android app that looks absolutely horrible if the user sets their font size to large or extra large (via Settings -> Display -> Font size in Ice Cream Sandwich). It just plain wasn't designed for variable font sizes, and it makes a lot of the text unreadable. I've seen applications that preserve the font size for most views, so I know that there has to be a way to do this. Is there a simple way for me to tell the application to ignore the user's font size preference? And if there isn't, how would you suggest that I go about calculating the font sizes? If nothing else, is there a way for me to retrieve the user's font size preference?
Nobody answers here..sad!!!
I recommend VirtualBox. Every time I use VPC I soon give up because the performance is terrible. I run VirtualBox with a Vista virtual PC allocated 1.5gb ram and it runs really well. In fact I don't really notice much slow down from running natively.
Indeed, this is awful. A pity there is no option to change it. Every other IDE/editor I used opened tabs to the right.
How does one make M-( the default behavior for typing an opening "(" character? I want Emacs to automatically insert the closing ")" after the cursor when I type a "(" character regardless of whether it's part of an M-key combination. Additionaly, I want to extend this behavior to quotes, subquotes, brackets and braces. Typing M-( is a pain, and there don't appear to be any comparable forms for those other characters.
I abhor debugging a `forEach` loop. Step in, step out. It's so much easier to just debug a `for` loop;
I for checking whether the function exists yet. In summary: Does that work for you? If it does then you can just wrap in a loop. A bit less nasty than a setTimeOut!
I've seen this bug in resharper 4.1. It happens when the base class is in the App_Code directory. Don't know how to fix it, very annoying, code still compiles though.

Ugh, indecent exposure of mod_rewrite should be a crime. Put a bathrobe on it, or something.
Malice? Seriously though, it's hard to account for formatting style sometimes. It's largely a matter of personal taste. Personally, I think that both forms are a little nasty unless you're seriously restricted in terms of line-length.

Can anyone think of a quick, easy and fullproof way of listing only ClearCase Remote Client views from UNIX? ct lsview obviously lists all the views, and you could search by looking at the Properties: section if you run a ct lsview -properties -full (gives you Properties: snapshot webview readwrite) then use a regex or something, but I'd be worried that someone calls their view 'webview' or something. Has anyone got a foolproof way? Am I missing a flag or something? If only there was -fmt on lsview :S

I have an .ico file with 5 icon sizes embedded in it being used as the main application icon and the System Tray icon. When it shows up in the task bar the icon is using the 16x16 format which is desired. When the icon shows up in the Notification Area/System tray, it is using the 32x32 format and Windows is rendering it down to a 16x16 icon, which looks horrible. How do I force windows to use the 16x16 icon size in the notification area? Here's my code to put the icon in the system tray:

I wondered if it's possible to set the editor windows tab width in eclipse. I hate it when I want to close several windows in a row and I always have to move the mouse. Can I set eclipse to use only ONE width for every window tab?
Pity you haven't said what you are monitoring for. You should decide whether 15 seconds is ok or not. Feel free to drop it way lower if you wish (and have a fast HDD) No worries unless you are running a soft real-time system Have a look at tools suggested in other answers. I'll add another sugestion: "iotop", for answering a "who is thrashing the HDD" questions.
Ran into this myself. Very annoying limitation IMO.
writing a stream manipulator is a very complicated way of doing something very simple!
I have an existing javascript/flash -interaction kludge that sucks terribly. Now I've decided it'd be better to write a flash app that does the specific thing without the need to interact with javascript. Therefore I'd need to produce flash apps in linux, and I don't have money to throw at adobe right now (perhaps never if their software keeps being terrible). Also not going to do software development on windows, have been there, conclusion: that's not going to work well ever. So, any solutions? Free or open source?
This is sad. 2010 and VCPROJ files have to be maintained by hand so the revision control system doesn't whack it out.
This is probably silly but very frustrating. Using VS2008 with a C++ project, when I'm working normally, the breakpoints window is visible and active but when I'm debugging it disappears and can't be shown. This is a problem if I want to edit the condition of a breakpoint while running. Pressing the breakpoints window button doesn't do anything and neither does pressing Ctrl+Alt+B Does this happen to anybody else? It's a brand new install with Visual Assist and QT integration as extensions. same configuration with VS2005 doesn't have any problems.
That was a terrible article, it started out right, Fisher-Yates/Knuth shuffle, then goes horribly wrong by trying to randomly order using guid as a source of randomness. Don't waste your time and just read the Wikipedia article on Fisher-Yates or use a library that implements shuffle correctly.
I'm afraid I can't really accept an answer here as it turns out that it can't really be done, without using a workaround, which I didn't want to do. Sorry!
FYI: When C or C++ say "undefined" they usually mean "crash" or "memory corruption" or something equally terrible. Beware.
Is there a sensible way to group Long UTC dates by Day? I would Mod them by 86400 but that doesn't take leap seconds into account. Does anyone have any other ideas, I'm using java so I could parse them into Date Objects, but I'm a little worried of the performance overhead of using the date class. Also is there a more efficient way than comparing the year month and day parts of a Date object?
I do hate the plain id name. I strongly prefer to always use the invoice_id or a variant thereof. I always know which table is the authoritative table for the id when I need to, but this confuses me What's worst of all is the mix you mention, totally confusing. I've had to work with a database where almost always it was foo_id except in one of the most used ids. That was total hell.
When running graphics based programs in Python for S60 (PyS60) the error messages and the output of the print statement (i.e. stdout) are hidden. If due to an error application stops working as expected its lost and tracking down the bug is very difficult, sometimes require running a "second stripped version" of the code. This is obviously painful. How do I log those errors to a file, so that I may see them later.
I hate it too. But did you stop to think why i wanted to do this instead of just assuming im an idiot? Its a small personal site, not a money maker. Rebuilt it to learn a new technology. Not bothered 301ing pages to their new versions. So instead trying to get some value to the homepage.
Don't use it. I hate std::pair exactly for this reason. You never know which is which, and since access to first and second are public you can't enforce contracts either. But after all, it's a matter of taste.
That link is full of horrible advice.
Lotus Notes....aaaaargh!
Yeah - my solution to this was to limit IE users - they can only select a tiny subset of the rows and columns that FX and Chrome users can. Even then IE8 only just copes with maybe 25 cells (5x5 grid), 7 and 6 remain hopeless. It brings back memories of late 90s web development and is an ugly thing to do, but what else can you do if their browser is so poor?
Unfortunately, no. That's my major pain when merging vcproj file changes.
IMHO multi-core processors are still so rare, and threading is such a horrible and hairy and dangerous place to go, that you're just better off sticking to one thread.
Is there a way to have mod_wsgi reload all modules (maybe in a particular directory) on each load? While working on the code, it's very annoying to restart apache every time something is changed. The only option I've found so far is to put below every import.. but that's also really annoying since it means I'm going to have to go through and remove them all at a later date..
Is it possible to use Twitter's API to grab search results? For example, if I wanted my page to show all tweets (man I hate that term) with the word "cat" in it? Is it also possible to get just the matching results that were after a certain date?
One thing I forgot, make sure the dev database you are running the migration from (the sql server database) is updated from production immediately before each test run. Hate to have something fail on prod because you were testing against outdated records.
@Kev its a deployment headache, you can ilmerge it in ... but still its an extra bit of luggage you need to worry about
Hate to say it, but I don't think there is a way to alleviate this. I do think that it depends on the client system, though, so a faster javascript engine or machine may make it slightly more accurate.
COM components are really a pain to manage, update, versioning, etc.
Notably, the debugger shows the string *with* escape characters. When the string is printed in the console, the escape characters are not included. "\"code\"" vs. "code". This 100 character limit is very annoying as it prevents you from copying, say, a long JSON string and then immediately pasting that string (escape characters included) as a test string variable in your code.
i am also having this exact problem. large table, nested divs within table. firefox renders teh page within 10 seconds, ie renders the table after a wait of 2 minutes. firefox still zips along with teh drag and dtop, ie crawls.. infact it freezes, and the drag and drop sdoes not work. am going to try some of teh solutions below. the fixed width, and the #id tagname.class references. But i do fear that it will still be slow. if anyone else has some good i deas, I would be all ears.
I'm developing an OSX application () that runs with LSUIElement set (system menu only - no tray icon, doesn't appear in cmd-tab). It works totally fine, but someone just pointed out that it has a blank process name in the Activity Monitor listing. Just says nothing. Everything else in there has a name. Even other apps running at LSUIElement. I've tried to search around the web, but I can't spot anyone talking about this. What on earth should I be looking for?
@DevSolar I would like to use boost more, but its synergy with C++11 is terrible, and there are some rather... _curious_ design decisions (Iostreams requires Devices to be copyable, but makes streams noncopyable... oh, and also nonmovable - at least in th
I'm cleaning up the CSS on a fairly large (and somewhat disorganized) website. Is there a simple way (or a piece of software) that will let me find, for example, all the "a" tags that are within "h3" tags? Or all the "spans" that are within "p" tags? I want to modify some of these CSS rules but I'm afraid I'll break something hidden somewhere. Any advice?
As mentioned on StackOverflow podcast 30 - JanRain RPX has beaten me. Sad face for me.
This algorithm is terribly inefficient for small sample chosen from a large set. Picking 5 integers from a million takes one million calls to rand() instead of 5.
I often need to execute custom sql queries in django, and manually converting query results into objects every time is kinda painful. I wonder how fellow Slackers deal with this. Maybe someone had written some kind of a library to help dealing with custom SQL in Django?
The move to version 7 is painful, I totally agree. Our process has taken just as long (and seems to be stretching out forever) - especially coming away from Rational Suite into individual v7 products.
What's the easiest static (non-animating) 3d model format to load with Java? I used .obj in C++, but that's a pain to do in java. Is there anything better?
In netbeans, if I select some text and press , it works correctly and the text is indented to the right side as expected. But if I then try to backspace behind the text, it only removes one space at a time. Very annoying. Is there any way to change this setting, so backspacing behind a tabbed line causes the whole tab to be removed and not just 1 space?
It's a terrible idea to include a using directive in a header file too. This simply mitigates that problem.
Don't want to beat a dead horse, but it is really important that you understand that this is a terrible idea.
ADG is a terrible and wondrous thing. I'm still trying to figure out the "data" object structure when using group fields Cheers
Ah, this was actually dumb...I solved it. I had two checked out directories that were both very much the same. I was in Eclipse and I didn't realize that I had been editing the wrong file all along. STUPID! STUPID! STUPID! Oh well it's not a total loss, now you all get to see how to fix ff3.
In general, this is a _terrible_ idea. C++ headers are not intended to be included in an alternately namespace as was used here.
can you help? i have a DB, the unique identifiers are GUIDS - we need to implement URL rewriting however the page names look terrible for example: testpage-2668FF87-0A3A-4cac-B9AB-2367D17A76C3.aspx title of page / unique identifier my DB's that i setup i use Ints as unique identifiers so i never had this problem: testpage-1.aspx title of page / unique identifier (int) what do you suggest ?
Would've loved to. But there is no hash_map in the C++ standard library, and PHB's don't allow code outside of that.
I have one of the Microsoft keyboards with their Function lock... man I hate that thing.
I am currently developing a system on a server running PHP version 5.1.6 thus I am forced to use Symfony 1.1 in the current environment. I am planning to migrate the application from 1.1 to 1.2 in the somewhat near future and I was wondering if anyone has any experience with this? I have attempted to migrate a system from 1.0 to 1.1 and that was a major pain in the rear. How has it been for anyone out there migrating from Symfony 1.1 to 1.2?
I can't help think that making XML ad XMLList both unrelated, as in both extend Object directly, is a design flaw in the AS3 core library. Surely having XML extend XMLList would be a much cleaner system, where XML is considered an XMLList with only one member? This would also avoid the very annoying practice of an E4X query possibly returning either an XML or XMLList, which can result in a casting error. So is there any reason I'm not thinking of that XML and XMLList were designed to only have Object as a common type?
In theory, you could apply that philosophy to every single question on SO. But it would be terribly boring to do so.
I have various files that I want to be ignored by SVN when committing. I know that I can go into TortoiseSVN and ignore them in various ways. I know that I can run svn propedit svn:ignore from the command line to do the same thing. The problem is that I have to have everyone on my team to do that, which is a pain. Is there a way that I can put some file in a folder or set something in my SVN repository that tells it to never check a certain file in?
Alan, I assume some people already hate you just for asking. And they have a point.
I have a basic app written with ATL, using the wizard with VS2008. I have a treeview in the left side of the app. I see how to (painfully) add tree items. Question is how do I show a menu when the mouse is right clicked? How do I trap any click events on each item that could be selected?
For C# Visual Studio uses 4 spaces by default, whereas for C++ it is hard-tabs. Why is it so? Why is it different? My project consists of both C# and C++ code and the difference really annoys me. I want to set a common standard for all the sources, but I wonder if this would have any drawbacks.
I have a class, let's call it LineGraph, that renders a line graph. I need to subclass it, but the derived class is only used in one place and is coupled to the class that uses it. So I am using an inner class. I see two ways to do this: Anonymous inner class Named inner class I am not a fan of anonymous inner classes, because frankly I just think it looks really ugly. But in the case of a subclass that's only used in one place, is a named inner class overkill? What is the accepted practice?
I want to change an image of an UIImageView from the applicationDidFinishLaunching method of the app delegate class. But I am afraid that this class doesnt know much about the controller outlet. What must I do in this case?
Currently the msbuild logs for team build are appalling as they are just plain text and are very difficult to read. Also the ones created by my build are approx 30Mb and take quite a while to download (our TFS server is in our datacentre). Does anyone know any way of being able to view these logs easier, prefereably integrated with either TFS itself or TFS WebAccess?
Some more depressing news here: http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=tn_14213
Not an answer, but why on earth would you want 32,000 items in a combo box? That is a terrible way to store that much data.
I hated using UML tools till I found http://yuml.me/ which offers some sort of DSL to describe UML diagrams. No mouse-fiddleling any more :-).

I have a page that uses excanvas to draw some images. While testing the new page in IE6, one computer attempts to open office 2000 and install a missing component. If the office 2000 install is canceled the vml images appear. This problem only happens on one of my test machines but it still worries me. Anyone seen this issue when using IE6 and excanvas before?
Does anyone commit Qt to their own source control? If so, how do you do it? Do you commit the whole Qt directory or do you pick only the ones that your application needs (bin/lib/include/src) How do you handle the case when new Qt version comes out? I'm asking because I'm trying to setup Build automation and Qt moc is a bit of a pain...and just wondering how people handle committing 3rd party library in general.
Sorry to be a pain, but I have 2 questions. 1) But where is the log? I assumed that it would be in $ftpreturn. 2) How do I check the bytes sent?
The ToolStripManager is hopelessly broken. LoadSettings doesn't do a thing...and I'm evidently not the only one with this problem: https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=128042 So...anyone have a workaround? The one posted in that thread just moved all the toolbars to the bottom of the window.
I ended up writing a python parser myself. I managed to do it by following the spec here: And then taking the code tables from the horde.org cvs. The open mobile alliance's site and documentation are terrible, this was a very trying project :(
The method in .NET returns a by-ref version of a type, e.g. passing the type of returns a type representing . However, if you already have a , what is the mechanism for obtaining a plain old ? There doesn't seem to be an opposite method to remove the by-ref modifier. At the moment I've put a hack in place which re-builds the assembly-qualified name without an at the end of the type name and then loads that type, but this is horribly dirty...
@sixlettervariables: No, I'm not asking. I'm scared of the answer.
This is simply the tip of the WTF iceberg I'm exposing with this question. The rest of the app, and the purpose for its very existence is more painful, if you'll believe it.
Evaluation of what? I may be being slow today, but I really don't understand what your problem is. I'm awful tempted to vote to close on the principle that I don't see a real question.
Your solution is subject to all sorts of horrible HTML escaping issues and possibly injection attacks.
Anyone have a graphical tool for developing mod_rewrite rules. Ideally it would display a pipeline of rewrites and then when given an instance of a uri would show the transforms as the get applied. It's always a pain to get them setup just right so any way of making it easier would help.
This is officially the first time I have seen it referred to as Red Gate's Reflector as opposed to Lutz Roeders Reflector. Sort of sad in a way
I have a main flash from wich i load another swf file from the server. From time to time i change the second swf file and want to load a fresh copy from the server. I clean the cache from the browser but my client does not know how to do that and it's a pain to give him directions. If i want to load a fresh copy of the main swf i just add a "main.swf?version2" but i can't do that with the loadMovie function in flash. Any ideas how i can get a fresh copy from the server without changing the name of the file?
I actually tend to prefer PascalCase here - but out of habit, I'm guilty of UPPER_CASE...
I have a user control that I've created, however when I go to add it to the XAML in the window, intellisense doesn't pick it up, and I cant figure out how to add it to the window. I'm pulling my hair out here! Any help is greatly appreciated!
I get the following when I build locally I get this error when building locally or on the team foundation server. Not exactly sure how to solve it, have the iis app pool and web site running as the tfs user so it doesn't have any problem viewing the website but the error is really irritating as its always telling me my build is broken.
cat'ing a script to paster shell scares me. The interactive Python shell has different rules for, e.g. terminating multi-line statements.

Is search and replace the only way to rename as asp control in the code behind file? I find this extremely annoying, but it is the only way I can find. Scenario: I'll find a variable that needs renaming (Usually to meet naming convention) I'll rename the variable in the aspx/ascx file. I'll have to go in the code behind files and search and replace. I get annoyed Are there any better ways - preferably that would not touch a similarly named variable in another scope in the project. I'm on VS2008 with resharper -- does VS2010 address this perhaps?
I've done some easy .hover(function() statement in jQuery. When i hover over a text i simply want a #div.fadeIn, and on non-hover fadeOut. It works. But it's just if i spam the text-trigger with hover and un-hoverring really quickly and then stop the animation begin to give a blinking effect. It just kind of loops, really annoying!
damn..thats what i was afraid of!!
You could try this one (not optimal, I am afraid):
I am aware of question, but not to sure how to map it to my current situation. (Rebase is scary, undoing rebase is double scary!) I started out with several different feature branches of my master: I wanted to merge them all together and check they worked before merging back onto the top of master, so I did a: Then Which leaves me with Then I corrected some bits that didn't compile properly, and got the whole feature set to an acceptable state: My problem is that my colleagues tell me that we're not ready for FeatureA. Is there any way for me to keep all my work, but also revert to a situation where I can just rebase FeatureC on to Feature B?
Also if someone could please let me know if my question is hard to understand, I will re-state. This is incredibly frustrating...suddenly my Stylus files are not compiling at all, and I have not changed any code.
I'm afraid not, I ended up just removing some of the deeper folders to work around the issue - not ideal!
Official guide says: Tomcat deployment is trivial and requires copying the WAR file into the TOMCAT_HOME/webapps folder and restarting the container. But this is really painful :-( Does there any way to deploy app without restarting Tomcat ?
I've updated the fiddle. I had to use classes to get it to work, so its not 100% perfect imo.
In my mental model of authentication, a user should be distinct from the way they log in. So for example, a User could have an associated EmailLogin (with an email/password), or they could have many (or none). Similarly they could have 0..* associated OpenIDLogin credentials. Are there any existing authentication libraries for Rails which use this method? Alternatively, is this a really terrible idea?
That didn't work I'm afraid :( Daniel, main.cs: http://pastebin.com/CCdchuQs

I really hate Jquery, your code looks as if you are looking forward to publishing your project finalized with Jquery..Anyhow.. if your looking to replace the jquery selector $("") with a function you should know that the function requires that it returns a DOM element. otherwise an error will be flagged and java script with abort.
Ah man, my changes did not save. JSFiddle was lagging terribly for me so I'm not suprised -- sorry!

I running an exe from a .NET app and trying to redirect standard out to a streamreader. The problem is that when I do myprocess.exe >> out.txt out.txt is close to 14mb. When I do the command line version it is very fast but when I run the process from my csharp app it is excruciatingly slow because I believe the default streamreader flushes every 4096 bytes. Is there a way to change the default stream reader for the Process object?
SORRY! had some syntax issue, i fixed it and it works now...what should i do with the question?
The function is extremely annoying because it uses a prototype or something insane like that. You'd have to do an ampersand-call to override the prototype: .However, you are trying to transpose the matrix, not to it (which would produce a continuous list like We could use an iterator in conjunction with : which works, but this is severely overthinking the problem.

I absolutely despise working with PDF documents. But when I absolutely have to, I have been using . It has quite a bit of functionality, , and it is theoretically free. Though to use it effectively it helps if you get the book that they push on their website.

In Sublime Text 2, if I press escape the page goes into COMMAND mode, which seems to take text input as commands, rather than actually typing the text. Another oddity is the VISUAL mode, and I have no idea what it does besides it seems to highlight text. I think they came installed with the theme that I got, 'soda', maybe. Anyway, I searched and found out you can turn off COMMAND mode by pressing 'i'. Regardless, both of these modes are extremely annoying, how do I get rid of them?
The problem is exact what mysql is telling you : you have too much data for one table. Not only the number of fields are counting towards them, but also their size.. But the real problem is in your database design, you have designed a table that is crying out for help : 'split me up, split me up!' You should your design ..
I'm afraid you can't!! Weka is not covering that functionality.

The search term on both Stackoverflow and PInvoke.net yields zero results, so this should be worth asking. I've been fiddling around on MSDN and looking through Win SDK *.h files all day, and feeling a bit out of my element. I'm basically attempting to query the MSRPC endpoint mapper with managed code. Here is what I have so far: The above code isn't complete, but it illustrates my point. The code consistently returns: RpcMgmtEpEltIngNext: 87 87 meaning Parameter is Incorrect according to . So I'm basically stumped at this point, and I'm sure it's because of my extremely crappy PInvoke code.
That's too sad :(

I really hate asking questions that I feel were asked a thousand times before. This is one of those questions I feel others must have encountered, , none of the supposed solutions work for me so I must be doing something wrong..... I have an extremely simple app setup. index.htm, and terms.htm. There is some textual data in test.htm. I set both and at the appropriate time after stuff has loaded. At first I tried loading terms.htm's data into an element within index using (both test and index are in the same root /assets/www/ directory, and my webview loads index oncreate) but absolutely nothing was happening. So I opted to try .ajax so that I could at least get an error message, and all I get is 'error'. Surely, it is possible to load local textual assets with JQ on DroidGap?
For various reasons Microsoft decides that some info should be kept away from developers. But people through reverse engineering find out what these reserved fields are about and produce their own documentation. Some times people guess correct.

It is very sad :(
Currently making a java program that grabs data off of a MSAccess Database and some of these errors are extremely frustrating. I keep getting this SQL.Exception : Too few parameters.

When querying from the database using Entity Framework, what exceptions should one catch and what should be done about them?

You're not calling which is what you really want to be doing, effectively. It's just another case of Java generics being a bit of a pain :(
I just updated my MacVim to 7.3 and with it, it now changes directories to whatever file I'm currently editing. I use PeepOpen, so it's incredibly annoying to cd back to my project directory every time I want to edit a new file.
Gah. parsing HTML with regexes. horrible horrible horrible.
I am currently workin on a visual studio online hosted project that uses git for version control and have run into a problem with the team explorer menu. All of my collegues get this view when connecting to the project: But on my machine, im missing the tiles/buttons and have to right click the current branch, choose manage branches and from there, select Changes/Unsynced commits to handle my code which is extremely annoying. Im using Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate for this project, but i also have VS2012 installed.
I had the same problem and ended up doing the same workaround. When I was done I didn't really hate it though, because it allowed me to free-up the UIPageViewController and all of it's child UIPageViewControllers and all of their resources when the user wasn't actively using the tab.
-1 for not explaining or giving details. I hate these types of questions!
this is a disgustingly horrible hack, but it might get the job done:
Yes. You make me sad :(
Never been this frustrated before... I HATE UIs! Will have to deal with them one day
Tools to automate alteration of markup code for any objective are a horribly frightful proposition. Simply write your code correctly the first time. If you have archaic code then it likely has many other problems in addition to SEO, and automatically imposing global changes can expose problems you may not be prepared to address.
A copy of an infinitely long string terrifies me!
After installing a lot of apps, and building a few myself, I'm sure many people have been wondering about this. If I'm looking through my SD card it looks absolutely horrible, and its really hard to find folders that are mine for putting music/videos/pictures in between all the folders for different applications. Is there any conventions here that we, the developers, should try to put their apps into one base folder or has Google forgot about this completely?
My NSLog messages no longer show up in my Debug Area. Anyone have an idea how the could have happened? I can hit command-7 to bring of a list of logs in the left pane, select the latest one and view it in my editor window, but it is extremely annoying compared to having the console output in the debug area.
Instead of loading everything which is neither possible nor really desirable I would use a sliding window instead - when you reach a certain maximum list size (say i.e. 300 items) you automatically remove the top 100 items when you add the next 100 items to the bottom. If you scroll just right after the update this shouldn't even be noticeable by your users.
Hate ghost comments! :(
Here is my PHP code.. ..I'm extremely crappy with my JavaScript code, could someone help me convert this? I basically want to convert a variable such as "marine-heavy" to "Marine (heavy)".
I really hate to answer my own question but I found the problem and the report is opening as of right now. I only came across this by chance but it seemed to work. I changed the setting of Display on SharePoint Site to Do Not Display. I never noticed that option before so I gave it a try. SharePoint is on the laptop which I didn't know at the time and I know nothing about it, but at least it shows on the screen now.
I've done some easy .hover(function() statement in jQuery. When i hover over a text i simply want a #div.fadeIn, and on non-hover fadeOut. It works. But it's just if i spam the text-trigger with hover and un-hoverring really quickly and then stop the animation begin to give a blinking effect. It just kind of loops, really annoying!
it generate but i need But in i did not find a way how to change ID attribute. i need to use text_field_tag because it fills textbox with params if submit fail. if i think about im worry if i change an ID it does not fill a param ?!

You should never, ever use . It gets really really slow as the size of table grows. Instead you should . In case you have irrational fear of learning, here is there solution which would do what you ask for:
To my limited knowledge, in Android, any activity must belong to a given process. However, the book says: " The activity life cycle is not tied to the process life cycle." that is to say, even if the process has been completely killed, its activities can still be alive! What makes me confused is: Because the input handlers of an activity are bound to the process. If the process has been killed, how do its activities react to the user's inputs?
Does anybody have a simple code to display a list (list view?) of all the apps installed on a phone, and have the user open one when clicked? Or even an App drawer. I just need a way to have the user open all of their apps. I have tried searching for tutorials, but couldn't find any, and I downloaded the example home from Android, but I absolutely hate looking through code and digging out what I Want.
I would guess it is doing basic sanity checking (i.e. should anything have changed) - to prevent unexpected source code changes (I hate it when opening a file can cause side-effects - I'm looking at you, DBML!). On a side note, to force serialization generally (I don't think it will apply due to the above): the and are a convention used by the framework.

@ceejayoz I use svn for development, but I really hate the idea of having many ".svn" folders in production.
This is heinous. I would not allow such a thing to survive a code review.
This isn't really pythonic so much as tortured, but here's a short version (with meaningless 1-character variable names, no less!)
It seems very tedious! I have a nine table join to join together, where two of the tables is a inner join and the rest 6 is left outer joins. Is it doable in entity?

@Dennis I edited my answer. I really hate IE!
I am referring to this behaviour: (Windows doesn't include the mouse cursor in the screen shot, I'm hovered on the uppermost (+) here.) I find this incredibly annoying in some cases, especially with larger methods. In , I have both checkboxes blank.
I used multiple requests - batches of 10. I don't want to anger the Api!
I got very angry with Oracle today after reading lots of editable TableView solutions involving setOnEditCommit, which is just NOT the right way it should be done. Following is a much better and simpler solution I found after digging the JavaFX source:
Still no go, I am afraid :/ This does not remove 'www' from the url.
I'm having the exact same problem! Incredibly annoying!
Very annoying! If you are desperate to get this working you could force Chrome to redraw the element (on window resize, maybe?):
That is really sad :(
Hate to have to do this, but it works!
I'm afraid I don't know of any other option than work!
We have released a beta version of our software, and as we talked to people who started using it, we have found that a lot of the features (which we thought were essential) were not known and not used by the users. What are the possible ways to inform the application users about the features of the application? I personally find the "Tip of the day" popups extremely annoying and disable them quickly. Are there better ways?
upvoted scared the hell out of me when things stopped working!!
If it's forms auth then yes, that's weird. I'm afraid I don't have any idea!

Link is down again.
I am running VS 2012. Working on a project that is stored on a mapped network drive. Whenever I go to close the solution it takes several minutes (5-7) for Visual Studio to close. It does eventually close, but very painful waiting for it to finish. Anyone have any suggestions on how to fix?
Official guide says: Tomcat deployment is trivial and requires copying the WAR file into the TOMCAT_HOME/webapps folder and restarting the container. But this is really painful :-( Does there any way to deploy app without restarting Tomcat ?
It is really painfull to get all code form TFS whenever you make a build using NANT. Is there any settings in ccnet.config which will only take the files which are changed form last time which can speed up the process.
This answer is not optimal because I have no clue which Konrad you are referring to.

Okay, so given the overwhelmingly negative response, does anybody think db image storage is _ever_ justified?
Im maintaining a site where I need to 'click' a link with javascript. The href is inline javascript, not a url so I cant just navigate to that url instead. Im expect this is bad practice (the rest of the site is terrible!) but I need to make the link 'clicked' with javascript. Im using jQuery. I know this question has been asked before but it seems normally people are trying to follow the link, which I am not.
I have a complex site that incorporates alot of javascript and it is getting absolutely KILLED by IE7. How would I go about serving this code: HTML JS In such a way that IE7 never gets the and therefore never hides ?

I found this code (full version here ) It's work for me but now i don't know how to stop it (for making test it's horrible, my new php file not interpreted!)
My first instinct is to branch normally (using p4 integrate), and then use an IDE or sed script to change the package names. But this makes future integration from the trunk extremely painful.
Ergh, this OptionBuilder has a horrible interface!
I have a that has three views per cell, with three cell displaying on the view at one time (for a total of nine views). Think of it as a bookshelf. Sometimes I can have as many as 500 books. I've added shadow to the with code that is this: When I add the shadow code, as seen above, scrolling performance is just totally killed and becomes choppy. Each image has a different so the shadow has to be created for each item as it scrolls. Anyone have any tips on how to add shadows to my images on a without having this issue?
Offtopic: why the hell do you apply the regexp only to the first 4 characters of the user agent? This is going to fail horribly in most cases.
Solution found . It's a known bug at Microsoft since may 2010, and they have still not released a patch. Have to use the workaround suggested there. What a PAIN!
It's not possible to open the page in full screen without user interaction (clicking on a button etc.) because it would be extremely annoying.

I have a file in the form If I try to splot such file, gnuplot intended it as a surface, and the result is very awful (because the endpoint of a line is close to the endpoint of next line, not to the first point). How can I plot them as different lines (as every line was in a different file)?

:-( This is a well-known CSS bug in IE6. AFAIK the workaround (it's horrible, shield your eyes) is to put an IFRAME underneath your menu so that the IFRAME obscures the improperly z-indexed SELECT. It's so very horrible. But JQuery is here to the rescue, as always:
Is there a simple library out there for Java in a Maven repository that will give me simple, one-liner hash methods for the popular hash functions such as MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512? I'd really hate to have to reinvent the wheel to do this.
Okay I am using the same ANTLRWorks and JDK .. but it doesn't work for me :( .. Its very irritating, I have tried everything to make it work !
I had figured out the solution. What I realized was happening was that The deployments stopped working period, not just certain files were not coming across. This is absolutely a bug in Azure deployment as near as I can figure. I had to drop & recreate my site in the cloud and the deployment continued to work. As a side rant. Microsoft makes it extremely painful for someone to submit a bug as compared to other software vendors. And they wonder why their market share is shrinking.
I absolutely hate how tabs work in Xcode. However, the only workaround i found that works decent is using the OSX tabs shortcuts: CTRL + CMD + -> CTRL + CMD + <-
I think it should be a warning. Generally speaking, the common rule is that 'you should treat warnings as errors'. If I unintentionally write unreachable code, I will see it in the warnings, and fix it anyway. However, sometimes, like Neil says, you intentionally create dead code, for debugging purposes or whatever reason. I'd really, really hate it if the compiler would not let me do that.
sad... very sad.
a very sad face :(
when I'm drag and drop some in chrome, it always make some noise, you can try it in your chrome: click on some empty place, then drag, then release mouse, it makes the sound. I really hate it, and I have seen some page don't have the chime sound, and I think it can avoid use javascript, can anyone tell me?
I use neo4j tool to start Neo4j in windows, But a strange thing is, today, when I open the neo4j shell, I start it , but no response, the status is in yellow and never turn to green, it can't establish neo4j server. It is so terrible for my database!!!! Does anyone meet this ?
i am working on iphone app, at once it started showing me error, with no exception, i am really afraid of this error, can any one tell me why this is happening?
I've been having this issue for some time and kept just disabling the "Script" tab which is really annoying! I tried to click the pause button so it's flashing and refresh, same issue. Then, click so it's not flashing and refresh, same issue. I just now clicked the pause button (so it was blinking), then un-clicked it so it was not blinking, and then refreshed the page and it seems to have fixed it. The same page that was breaking on a script error is no longer breaking on the error.
Very sad, no way...(
Oh, man, I am sorry but I must say it: your code is really awful... It is not organised at all, but maybe... shouldn't be instead? EDIT: try to comment the second and third queries, since they seem useless, and make the "cur" -> "cursor" change I suggested:
she records the class (the computer screen shot) but it's very useless! she confuses herself and the class..
The dreadful integer arithmetic attacks again! When you calculate ((3+2+1)/100), since all the operands are integers, Ruby uses integer arithmetic rather than floating point arithmetic. If you do 7/100 it will also return 0, as it's rounded down to the nearest integer, which is 0.
It's a very painful process to ajax `files` to a server side script. You might try: http://fineuploader.com/

I am sorry to say this but most Silverlight grids do not support cell merging. At least not out of the box. I have resorted to using Component One studio for Silverlight in order to achieve this, and even then it hasn't been exactly a walk in the park. Consider C1 Data Grid control. Here is a sample on with sample code and a small write up. The down side of such solutions is that C1's controls are extremely expensive :( I wish Micro$oft came up with some enhancements in SL5 that would accommodate for such issues.
I have run into this too. It is very annoying! Here's why it might be happening. The width of your li items, plus any margins is more than the width of #maincontainer. That means the last li item spills over #maincontainer and the script will want to move that last bit in, leaving an extra click. One way to check this: assign an id to the last li, and make the width less, and see if that doesn't fix it. If so you need to make the #maincontainer wider.
doesn't mean nothing. You have to use

I am trying to make a search TextBox with an embedded magnifying glass icon. I have the following markup so far: However, I can't find the entry in SystemColors which will give me the same color as the standard TextBox border. This is a blueish color by default.

StyleCop has rules that seem to differ from MS's prior style guides. For example, StyleCop hates m_ and _ for prefixs to private members. Also, the VS default code generation violates StyleCop by putting using statements outside the namespace. *sigh*

I am trying to save a ListObject from a .NET 3.5 Excel 2007 VSTO Workbook to a new sheet (done) and save that new sheet to a new workbook (done) without that workbook requiring the VSTO customization file (!!!!!). Has anyone had any luck with this? The only way I've had any success is just saving as a CSV file but that's not exactly acceptable in this case. I'd rather not save to a CSV just to copy back to a XLS file. worksheet.SaveAs(saveDialog.FileName, Excel.XlFileFormat.xlOpenXMLWorkbook)
My goal is to write a cookie when the user authenticates. We are using a crappy framework that hides its source code and event model so when I use their login control I can't set a session timeout on it! Anyhow, I am trying to write a cookie when the user is logged in, and then refresh the cookie expire time on subsequent page views (sliding expiration). So I figured I could initially create the cookie during Application_AuthenticateRequest in teh global.asax but that seems to be firing even when the user hasn't signed in yet. Is that suppose to be the case?
I'm unable trigger a click on the body tag using jQuery, I'm using this... even this fails Any ideas?!
I'm not sure why this answer was accepted. This simply isn't the correct answer. Deadlocks can occur whenever you have multiple threads. There's nothing inherent in GUI programs that makes them more likely to happen. Furthermore, they can easily happen even if you use BeginInvoke(). Brian Ensink's answer is the correct one.
Obligatory I Am Not A Lawyer. Are you violating the legal clauses of the GPL? Probably not. ATI and nVidia do this sort of thing with their graphics drivers for Linux. However, it's important to note that Linux is GPLv2; this may have changed with GPLv3. Are you violating the spirit of the GPL? Yes, and judging from the way your question was written, you already knew this.

My code is In both Main and Main2 I get MainWorks works, but it would be really annoying and inefficient to have to do that everywhere I want to call this function.
Strings containing XML is an extremely bad idea and asking for trouble. Use messages that have a defined schema.I had to rewrite significant portions of an app that used a lot of XML internally instead of types. It was horribly slow and impossible to figure out what was happening.

Ugh, implicit joins! I want to tear my eyeballs out looking at that.
I'm using VS2008, in a normal mid-size solution. Sometimes, debug stepping becomes very slow. A padlock gets rendered on the every file tab for every "step" (F10/F11), and it can take up to two seconds for every step. That makes debugging very annoying and slow. Has anyone seen this problem?
Why use a `Mutex` here? The `Acquire` method just returns a reference to an instance (this is a reference type). Whether the object referenced is mutable or immutable is irrelevant. The reference is to the same object no matter if the object mutates. Why do locking? Even if the instance was not "singleton" or "read-only", i.e. even if the field reference could change, since [reference assignments are atomic](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5209623/), there would still be no need for locking/`Mutex`. I will downvote this answer @ +109 net upvotes...
I really fail to see the use case... If you will type print_var_name($foobar) what's so hard (and different) about typing print("foobar") instead? Because even if you were to use this in a function, you'd get the local name of the variable... In any case, here's the in case there's something you need in there.
Its absurdly late/early so maybe I'm just tired, but can anyone tell me why in the world the following test is not failing? Really need a second pair of eyes to confirm I'm not crazy...now I'm worried that all my tests are unreliable.

All but one of the answers you got provide another frightening example of how people can get very basic C syntax wrong.
Is there an easy way to find parse errors in javascript code? Last week I was debugging a javascript problem where the first javascript function that was called gave an 'object expected' error. I later determined that this was because the browser wasn't able to parse my javascript code. I eventually solved the problem but it was a painful process that involved pouring over my code line by line, trying to find my mistake. There must be an easier way.
I just flashed back to an old Broderbund game... Can't remember the name of it. Awful CGI graphics, lots of cannon battles in old ships... Maybe the first pirates game? Damn, that was an AWFUL game. Had a rollup scroll in it.

The .NET installation is one of the most painful setups of all history, in all means possible. I've did many such setups and about half of them even *crashed* for XP.
Yes, these queries are horrible. Do a regular join instead.
The Tumblr iPhone app looks awful --both the gradients and the unnecessary boxed look imposed by the gray border. Stick to the standard UITableView look. What Apple uses for *their* apps is what looks most professional, not random novelty stuff.
The following (cut down) code excerpt is a Linq-To-Entities query that results in SQL (via ToTraceString) that is much slower than a hand crafted query. Am I doing anything stupid, or is Linq-to-Entities just bad at optimizing queries? I have a ToList() at the end of the query as I need to execute it before using it to build an XML data structure (which was a whole other pain). While working on this, I've also has some real problems with Dates. When I just tried to include returned dates in my data structure, I got internal error "1005".
Yes, the question mentioned it won't work. I was trying to describe why it wasn't terribly important to even try to do it that way.
My experiences sound similar to yours. I've only just started using doctrine, and have never used Propel. However I am very disapointed in Doctrine. It's documentation is terrible. Poorly organised, and quite incomplete.
As title, basically I have a user control placed inside a page and then the page is placed inside the master page. I want to extract a block of javascript and put it back to the page head. When I try to wrap the code inside any block control (e.g. a div runat server) and access divID.InnerText then ASP.NET bust off with I dont want to extract JS inside cs file, thats awfully ugly approach (all sort of escapes and people wont even notice you have JS written unless they drill your CS file), what can I do?
Note that this doesn't use a StringBuilder, so will have horrible performance for very long sequences.
Agreed. Don't do this, it makes people cry.

All the formatting templates in Eclipse will put the plus on the next row (which I find really annoying), so you can simply apply the code formatter and the plus will end up on the next row.

I have a password that I want to store as property in a Web Part that can be set via the tool pain. Currently it is a String and can be clearly read. How would I go about making it * out? If this is the wrong way to be doing this what would you advice to do instead?
You can look at OpenOffice Base. I tried it out awhile back when it first came out and it seemed awfully slow and it didn't seem feature complete either. But it is free and open source :o)
@Raubi: Which bit? It's still going to be horribly inefficient for long sequences, as it's still doing an enormous amount of string concatenation.
I have a method that does a bunch of things; amongst them doing a number of inserts and updates. It's declared thusly... It works exactly as it is supposed to and I have no problems with it. There are situations however when I want to force the rollback in spite of there not being an exception... at the moment, I'm forcing an exception when I encounter the right conditions, but it's ugly and I don't like it. Can I actively call the rollback somehow? The exception calls it... I'm thinking maybe I can too.
I don't know why the editor is giving me so much trouble. At first the code blocks wouldn't do anything but indent, so I had to change it to pre tags. Then my carefully numbered sequence is now all 1s. This thing is making me look ridiculous!
From my own experience, Microsoft SQL Compact Framework is a REAL NO-GO. It is REALLY FREAKING slow and its Query Analyzer is just really poor. I had to ask my team to rewrite all the plumbing code of my Windows Mobile component to get rid of the awful performances of SQL CE.
Usability notes: Personally I hate when sites put the "forgot password" or "forgot username" or "help" links inbetween the password field, and the Login button. As a keyboard user, I shouldn't have to TAB over them to get to the submit button. Better yet, also capture the Enter keypress on the password field so that I can auto-submit with the Enter key.
A (it doesn't have to be a class; structs and interfaces can be partial too) is basically a single type which has its code spread across multiple files. The main use for this is to allow a code generator (e.g. a Visual Studio designer) to "own" one file, while hand-written code is put in another. I've no idea whether Python/Perl have the same capabilities, I'm afraid.
That's just a 16 character requirement with an optional 2 character afterwards: The parentheses may not be required - I'm not enough of a regex guru to know offhand, I'm afraid. If anyone wants to edit it, do feel free...
I'm working on importing data from our application into Oracle Financials GL. It seems simple with the GL_INTERFACE table, and many resources online, but I don't seem to understand it. I'm looking for a simple way to post a transaction of $X on a specific date, between 2 or more accounts. I'm terrified of incorrectly posting anything in the GL.
Probably has something to do with the unbearable bugginess of the Telerik RadControls suite
How awesome would it be if the Delphi IDE would put code in 2 formats on the clipboard, so that code that is copied and pasted in e-mails or word-documents has proper highlighting instead of plain text?!
Ironically years later, I'm wondering why in the world I wanted to do this. I hate apps that do this.
@sambo99: I'm really not sure what you mean, I'm afraid.
I'll second the NI Measurement Studio. I've plotted 1000 points/sec with NI Measurement Studio's chart control. Also, this test was done on a laptop with a very lousy video card. AFAIK, Measurement Studio is using OpenGL internally.
I hate writing migrations, but it's important for the schemas to stay in sync. What I'd much rather do is update my and have Rails notice, then run something which generates the appropriate migration based on the difference between the old version and the current version. Is there a way I can do that?
But definitely agree that in 99% of cases office interop is horrible.
Basically, the doctype determines how crazy IE is going to be. If you don't set it to XHTML, or "strict" you'll be living in a world of hurt when it comes to IE (even if you set it, you'll still be hating on IE, but it does make it a lot better).
I was afraid of that. Poorly formatted code really bothers me. I guess I'll learn to live with it.
So for example if I need to run Git Pull in the commandline, I need to specify the full path to everything...? That's really annoying.
Tried this. Failed miserably. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/528224/how-to-use-linux-fonts-in-windows-qt

I am crying on the inside. And on the outside.
I find it comes back periodically. What's most frustrating about it is that everytime it does come back, it breaks WebDeploy as the account under which that runs does not have access to delete the aspnet_client folder created!
Hate to say it, but how about just testing it?
Nearly everything coming out of Redmond draws their menus differently then plain Win32 menus. It really annoys me that this never makes into the OS. OS-level Windows menus are so far out of date that drawing them yourself is nearly a requirement these days.
Ah - make me look lazy! (guilty)
I'm just going through the same process! I was looking at this page: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/connecting.html which starts talking about coffee shops! At that point I gave up. You've got to love java/oracle documentation!
I think I've been using these terms interchangably / wrongly!
There's some debate over that FAQ entry. Yes, by all means, answer your own question. But if you routinely have a set of pre-baked questions and answers, then this site just becomes a blog, rather than an exchange. You have the misfortune of picking a day when someone abused the spirit of that FAQ.

This is sad, I told you how to handle raw packets, and I only got 3 votes, while the accepted answer has 8 votes and basically didn't answer the question...
this is a terrible idea for webapps
Yup many hours later I found that a single panel that was wrapped around the section had a EnableViewState="false" added to it. Sad part is that I know I didn't add that because I didn't even know what it was until craig here mentioned it. Visual Studio must have added it sometime.
The other issue the number of variations in everyone's SIP implementation. Solving all of the integration issues would quickly eat up all your time. At $699 for OCS that just doesn't make much sense.
I have an asp:Menu control that has four different menu items in it. Each menu item has a graphic and a text description. My problem is the icon and text have no padding between them and it just looks ugly! Does anyone know how I can force a bit of padding between the image and text of the menu item? I've looked at all of the attributes on the asp:Menu control, but I haven't been able to find one for this, but I may have just missed it.
You can set the document.domain but if I remember correctly a few browsers (Opera) will not even allow this. I am afraid your answer is to create some sort of proxy on the subdomain that you can talk through
You should be able to add the attribute during OnPreRender(). INamingContainer is so painful sometimes...
Yup, wcf is a world of config pain, stick to asmx
Its amazing 1000+ questions tagged "programming" I just had to go find out how many quesitons were tagged "question" and there are some!! @Jon: FYI, SO is always about programming, non programming questions will very quickly get voted closed.
You're looking for an equivalent of and I'm afraid it doesn't exist explicitely in the STL. Go for Sebastien's answer if it is correct for your STL implementation.
The screen which shows whenever i start Netbeans is very annoying, and among the hundreds of options I can't find the one which turns it off?
WTF??? Why not just mark Enrico's answer as Answer instead of copying it over and marking your own answer? Stealing is bad, m'kay?!
Is there a VB6 equivalent to the C/C++ 'continue' keyword? In C/C++, the command 'continue' starts the next iteration of the loop. Of course, other equivalents exist. I could put the remaining code of the loop in an if-statement. Alternatively, I could use a goto. (Ugh!)
That's clever, but the performance must be HORRIBLE. Not that I'm saying there's a better answer, just shuddering at the O(n^2) of it.
No you can't. That awful thing doesn't work in managed mode or mixed mode.
Its not One is it? I have a method that gets five Lists from different repositories. Each call opens and closes a new Datacontext. Is this ok to do or should I wrap everything in One datacontext. In this case it is not straightforward to use the same datacontext, but i am afraid that opening and closing numerous datacontext in one page request is not good.
Crashes for me on a virtual machine without Flash loaded. I hate annoying Flash embeds as much as the next guy, but âusing it is BADâ might be overegging it slightly...
I've struggled with this in the past and tried to elevate permissions using caspol and it was a real pain. I ended up converting it to a click once app in 30 minutes and never had a problem with it since.
I am trying to search my bash history similarly as with CTRL-r, but to forward direction. It has been a pain for me, when I just hit once too often CTRL-r, to find the previous command again. How can you forward search your Bash history similarly as in reverse searching?
talks about consuming WCF services in Silverlight, but claims: There will be no proxies, no generated code, no 3rd party utilities, and no disgusting "Add Service Reference" usage. What is so wrong with me adding a service reference in my Silverlight project? Are there hidden overheads? Or is it a case of Fear Of Auto Magic on the part of the author?
I have full control of the deployment enviroment, it's an internal intranet application. Office interop/autmation is horrible, and while the documents are generated by C#, we use Aspose.Words. I can accept using interop.automation for printing, going to give it a try.
I've noticed this lag time also. Its really annoying when you go to /usr/bin to tell firefox what app to use to open a file and it lags for 10 seconds.
There are an awful lot of C/C++ libraries out there, most no longer updated. There's not much for C#, but I have seen a couple. I haven't really used any of them in anger, so I can't give any recommendations. I would start with and see if you find anything of use there. Alternatively, a search for on sourceforge.net has plenty of results.
Dude I feel your pain, same issue here.
the following code should show either the port or servername not both i always get both no matter what ? i have also tried the follwoing with no joy either !! i just cannot get the condition to resolve thanks in advance
Yes, there are, I'm afraid
The problem is that "Hello World" is a terrible example to use with TDD. You really need something that generates variable output based on variable input.
I could easily be wrong about that, most of my work is this horrid single threaded behemoth..

The minute you start down the road to control memory is the minute you start making a mistake. If you have REQUIREMENTS for memory, don't use .NET. If you don't have requirements, stop worrying about memory. .NET manages memory better than you ever could. Stop it. Leave it alone. No. Bad. Stop.
Bejesuz that's ugly! Whomever wrote that should be flogged.

@VitoshKa Excellent! Wish I could give you another up vote for th update
I have a long scrolling page, and want to test if an element is 100px from the top, then apply a class elsewhere (until the next element in line is 100px from the top) If I could just get the basic statement I would be ecstatic, anything extra would be a bonus!
Great time saver and hidden gem. Excellent!
Excellent! That makes life considerably easier. I really didn't want to add another layer to the application if I could avoid it. As far as StackOverflow etiquette goes, if I set this question as answered, Nikos won't get the rep for it as the answer is in the comments. What's the protocol?
Excellent article! Very useful :)
@Oded thank you this tool is very great!
Yep I've been testing some stuff recently under Safari 5.1.5 (WinXP) recently and when you have elements with tabindex="0", all the elements EXCEPT links ( with "href" defined) are focusable. By all elements, I mean s, s etc. It's absolutely amazing for me from the accessibility point of view!

I appreciate your warm welcome, I never seen such a warm regard here for trying to be helpful, it was a really pleasant introduction and I want to thank you for taking your time to write - at last the end of the questions reads "If anyone has any ideas I would be extremely grateful!"
Excellent point! Thanks!! I did mean just the left side though.. (I should have specified that). Was glad to learn your insight though..
This is really great question - well organised and explained, nicely done!
Thanks. That was a really great pointer!

I have a javascript document.write function that returns a textarea value to a field like so: Now, I need the output of what is returned from the document.write part to be in BBCode output, so if the value fetched from the document.write function is [b]hello[/b], it returns "hello" not [b]hello[/b].

Stu Nicholls's site has a lot of examples of how to do this without javascript. It's a really excellent resource.
I m really excited to know that html 5 has in build support for audio and video playback( I know its old news but I just woke up ! :P) . What is even more exciting is that it can play local audio/video files in matters of some click. I had a look at this , could not find any offline video player. my question is why is that people are not developing an offline media player which could just be loaded form a website ? are there some issues ? Thanks

I agree it's very ugly, but it does work! Well spotted.
You might want to look into JAXB. If you have a defined XML schema it will automatically create java classes that will easily allow you to 'marshal' (move data from java -> XML) and much much more. It's incredibly useful!
No worries! IE11 does a poor job of emulating other browser versions.
Well I'm kind of new with magento, and at work they ask me to do a group of products that they will be put in discount, so I created a category sales where I can link the products and put them in sale, so this is working perfectly, but the ask me to put dates in the products so the web master can put dates where the products will be shown between dates, so now I have no idea how to do this. I really hope you guys can help me thanks so much!
my pleasure :) :)

I'm pretty familiar with PGP, and the way it works. I'd like to include some functionality in a project, but so far my research has left my head spinning. What I'd like to do is create a public key with a defined private pass phrase. From there, I'd share the public key with someone where they can then encrypt a message using the key and return it to me where I can decrypt. I envision the code looking something like this. To generate my private pgp key: To encrypt I'd give my shared key to a friend: To decrypt the encrypted string after being sent back to me: Obviously I know I'm skipping out on a ton of details. Through my research I've seen references to libraries like Bouncy Castle and Spongy Castle. Any help would be hugely appreciated!

I've been experimenting with Linq to see what it can do - and I'm really loving it so far :) I wrote some queries for an algorithm, but I didn't get the results I expected... the Enumeration always returned empty: case #1 I changed the query declaration to be inline like this, and it worked fine: case #2 Does anybody know why it doesn't work in case #1 ? The way I understood it, the query wasn't evaluated when you declared it, so I don't see how there is a difference.
Well, I was using the setControlValueToUpperCase() method too soon it seems. So changing my keydown first if statement to fixed my issue. Horray Me!!

That answer was extremely helpful Scott, thanks for the pointer on that!
Wow that was exactly what I wanted! So the second solution I showed is somewhat similar to what he's describing but he describes also extremely elegant triggers that would keep all the data fully sane without any external code sanitization! I think I will go with that design!

So I'm trying to write a RR Rotation and LL Rotation with Java for an AVL tree. I have most of it figured out, however I don't know where I should modify the height within the method. I've been trying to understand it for a few days here but I cannot figure out where exactly it would go in the method I currently have. If someone could help explain exactly where I should put the modifications for the height of the node (it uses getLeft/setLeft for it's left height and getRight/setRight for it's right height) it would be extremely helpful!

I need someone to point me in the right direction on this.... In my Android application I have a ListView with custom views for each row containing various textviews each. I retrieve weather information for multiple locations and then want to write the results for each location to its own listview item. The question is, how do I refer to each textview on each listview item? I can't do it by name using , can I? If there are three items in the list, will the temperature textview for each item be names the same, just differ by an array index? If so, how do I specify TextViewName(0), TextViewName(1) and TextViewName (2) for the three list items? Yes, I'm still very new to Android....but loving it!

In ASP.NET MVC, I have a form. In this form the user selects a country, and then the ID is posted back to the server, using a normal . However, for some UX reasons, I use Knockout. Therefore I need to get my observable value to have the value of a dropdownlist. I want my label in the markup, to show the countryId, depending on the selected value on the dropdownlist. Markup: ViewModel: Then my question is: How do I modify my DropDownListFor, so the countryId is being set automatically? :-) Thanks a lot! I really enjoy learning Knockout, but this one has taken me a long time!
What options are there to pull a GApps user creation date? I saw that the Admin SDK is capable of it, is it the only API capable of doing this? does any of the previous one also capable of? If possible using GAS, it will be most excellent, Thank you!
Excellent! Thanks for the link.
I want to know what is good start point to work on creating own GUI on iphone/objective-c. I've never done this part before, and I know I'm kinda attracted to make my own slick GUI, something like convertbot, which I really love :) Any suggestion would be appreciated! Thanks
just wondering if anyone could help me. I have a file containing a line: xxxxx are 5 digit numbers and the numbers are different for everytime. I want to be able to search for xxxxx and put it in a variable, so I can use this varibale. Do I use grep and sed? If anyone can guide me through it, that'd be terrific :) xxx
No worries! Keep at it...it's overwhelming at first, but it gets easier

I'm using the ImageMapster jQuery plugin, and I want to limit the number of selections that can be made on a (image-) map to a certain number. Let's say I have 30 areas, but only want 3 to be selected at the same time. After 3 selections have been made, the 4th selection should overwrite the 3rd. Is there a way I can do this? Any help would be hugely appreciated!
is probably not what you want, but is still really excellent.
Found the culprit! At first I tried the solution suggested by @billinkc in the comment, it worked (I managed to create a folder) but the folder wasn't usable as I couldn't upload packages. I have db_owner permission on the MSDB database and so I can see and access the SSIS MSDB folder. What I really needed was the db_ssisadmin permission. Not to worry as db_owner permissions allow me to give myself the db_ssisadmin permission! After this was done, all the problems (the one in the original Q and more) disappeared.
I'm trying to create a grid (matrix) of squares in a given area with n columns and m rows, and an option to set a spacing between the squares if desired. The grid should fill squares with random coloring. I'd also like to add a zoom function, so the colored squares will appear much bigger in a region that is double-clicked. Can anyone suggest a good method to generate the grid and assign random colors to the squares? If you can suggest how to create the zoom effect too that would be SUPER :) I'm new to canvas, so any method help would be great! Thanks
+1 Excellent explanation!
Apple's MapCallouts code sample demonstrates how do do this with the callout and their Weather Map sample shows how to do custom annotation views. There documentation is really excellent and these samples are both helpful.
I need to echo only selected lines from a .txt file using PHP. The txt file content looks like this: The previous working code was echoing every lines. I'm trying to get the same formating but only with the selected lines. For instance let say only lines: 3, 5, 8, 10. The second step would then be if the lines could be echoed in a different order than the initial one. If someone knows a simple way to do it, that would be excellent! Thanx in advance.
Thanks. First method is really great!
This sounds like an excellent project! You might want to start with the module. You might also be interested in the module. Perhaps to get you started, here's a function that takes a path to a file and backs the file up by copying it and giving it a .bak extension.
Can anyone help me add children to a plist? I think I want to record an index of rows from the plist and then state which index row to write the key too. I'm not sure how to say if the key will be a string, dictionary or array. The following is code from another question on adding a key to root. Any help would be extremely appreciated :)
wow the reaction time on this by you guys was amazing xD I'll give everyone +1 once I get to the 15 rep ^_^ Thank you so much everyone!
Excellent! Glad that sorted it
@EdwardRuchevits Hey passing in cat and page worked! It now remembers it each time I navigate pages! Excellent! Question though, is 'cat' a predefined PHP variable for URLs? Also, while this works for me locally... how will this function when different us

So, it is as simple as purchasing a domain name, and then adding that identifying information to the hosts file? If so, that is excellent!!
Excellent! This should be marked as an answer. Very good solution.
Not sure if it's on my end or zombie.js's, but I cannot seem to get this very simple zombie.js script to work on my Backbone app. Is it something entirely on my end, or is it a known issue that zombie.js doesn't play well with Backbone apps? I'm also using Pow (http://pow.cx/) to connect to the app through myapp.dev in case that is related. Any advice or zombie.js examples with backbone would be extremely helpful!

I am using some PHP script to add some data from a complex form to MySQL db and then showing it all in some HTML table. Everything works just fine, but I would like to 'upgrade' my script with jQuery and (I suppose) AJAX. What I would like to do is when user submits data, the row (or ) shows up in the HTML table without refreshing a page. Form and table are on same page, of course... Some guidelines would be really helpful because I'm not sure should I even use AJAX or something else for my needs. Links for some tutorials will be also great :) Thanks a lot for any help!
([0-1 ]?[0-9]|2[0-3]):([0-5][0-9]) I think that's the regex you're looking for (not specifically for javascript though). This site has an excellent amount of info for language-specific regular expressions! Cheers!

I have a button that, when hovered over, I would like the background image to display also. (It is an arrow an explanation of the button). There are quite a few questions similar, but I couldn't quite tweak the answers to work for me. The HTML looks like the CSS then is Any ideas hugely welcome!
You DO need to modify web.xml whenever it's needed. Especially with JAX-RS, you will have to define your servlet in web.xml. I recommand you to use Maven. There are plenty of exemple in the web to do so. Good luck, JAX-RS is really great ! Maven is also nice.
was excellent :) However instead of creating a button object, I am only calling an OnTouchlistener to change the state of every view. Gives the same results though
Excellent, now that I know the name I can easily google tutorials! ty! :)
I absolutely *love* your title! But your question will need some more details if you need some help. Do you have any code you've tried?
That would be awesome. I could report 100% success rates on all e-mails! :)

Is there a way that I can get a list of the models that a particular model belongs to in Rails? For example: Hope this makes some kind of sense!
Well, not free. But we have had very good results with Nevron. Their support is excellent as well. Another good option is TeeCharts.
I have never parsed ini files, so I can't be too specific on this issue. But i have one advice: Don't reinvent the wheel as long as an existing one meets your requirements Good luck :)

Im using the AutoPersistenceModel in Fluent NHIbernate to map all my entities and that all works fine :D However, several of my objects have In the database there is a single comments table, and each entity with the above code, has its own link table to comments. At the moment what im doing is: for every entity. Is there some way i can set a convention where by all mappings to IList<Comment> are wired up automatically as manytomany with the above table name convention? Thanks Andrew
You made an excellent point in a comment below, @RailsSon: you want to print Â£s to display a specific currency, but employ that display using a Japanese expression for financial numbers. I find it strange that your request hasn't been implemented in the language by decoupling the `locale` module's use of currency value and that currency's display properties.
Wow! Yeah, I did'nt know that! Great new feature.

An excellent resource I've found for CI recently is by Martin Fowler, author of the famous "Enterprise Application Architecture" book. URL:
Very direct question, i need to know if its possible and maybe where to start reading about that. Im a programmer with zero experience in windows servers and a client is asking if we can deliver in their windows boxes(and no they wont let us use any kind of virtualization in them). Thanks guys, i know its not 100% programming related but... hope you can help =) EDIT: Wow, fast reply! Thanks guys!!!
awesome explanation!! this is seriously awesome..
Does anyone know of a link to a reference on the web that contains a sample English dictionary word script, that can be used to populate a dictionary table in SQL Server? I can handle a .txt or .csv file, or something similar. Alternatively, I'm adding custom spellchecking functionality to my web apps...but I don't want to integrate the standard components. If there are good references (with samples) on building a dictionary word checker, I'd love that too!
I did a lot of VRML+Java work in college and loved it, but I feel like it's not really a marketable skill. Has anyone worked with a high level graphics API like open inventor, coin..etc that is actually in use to a degree that makes investing a lot of time in the API worthwhile for something more than a hobby?
There's for a sort that should work, but just wasn't included in the core. Referenced from , I think you just pass in a function that is used to sort, like so Hope it helps!
You didn't mention the language, but for Java we've loved . For C/C++, getopt.
This is an excellent question. I look forward to hearing an answer.
great question, wondering it myself!
Good luck with the browser project!
@Adrian - that article was brilliant :D thanks for sharing it!

Great thanks fung! It was especially the "Starting Our Debugging Session" section that helped.
I really liked which C++ however you can easily translate that to C# the author has a web site too.
Excellent. Thanks.
We could, but that'd mean installing wsdl2ruby and so on and so forth. Sometimes Dog Slow is fine :-)

My work just gave me a quad core computer, and WOW build times are fast! (What used to take 20+ minutes now takes 7 minutes). Anyway, Visual Studio builds project in parallel (great for build times), but scrambles the output: Is there a plugin that sorts the output when the build is complete?
i wonder if there is something similar to Sql Profiler for Sql Server Compact Edition? i use SqlCE as backend for a desktop application and it would be really great to have something like sql profiler for this embedded database. or at least something simliar to the NHibernate show_sql feature... any ideas? thanks j.

David Flanagan's excellent book on JavaScript has an example that shows how to perform XPath queries in IE. On page 518 of fifth edition, you can see the following code snippet taken from example 21-10: I found out the hard way that this code is absolutely necessary. It appears (although I cant understand why) that on IE XMLHttpRequest seems to to randomly return a reference to either the document corresponding to the received XML or the documentElement. Whats happening here?
The (NLTK) is an excellent resource if you're considering Python as a language. It incorporates lots of the stuff you'd expect in a text processing/NLP environment like parsers, stemmers and part-of-speech tagging. Documentation on it is pretty good too. As for datasets, NLTK comes with a variety of for experimenting with. Hope it helps, B.
I recently imported about 60k records into a table that relates data in one table to data in another table. However, my client has since requested that a sort order be added to all 60k records. My hope is there is a nice clean way to auto generate these sort orders in a SQL Update. The finished data should look something like this: Can this be done? Any suggestions would be hugely appreciated. --Anne

In my company, we are currently using Qt and are very happy with it. I personnally never had to move a MFC-app into using the Qt framework, but here is something which might be of some interest for you : It's part of Qt-Solutions, so this means you'll have to buy a Qt license along with a Qt-Solutions license. (edit: ) I hope this helps !

All the places I've worked have given me liberty with regard to development environment, although the production env. has always been some brand of Linux - usually RH or CentOS. I personally use Windows 7 for dev., and I wouldn't use anything else. You spend way less time debugging the OS, and more time coding. This makes management much happier! (PHP developer mostly)

I use ApexSQL Diff. It is an excellent tool for doing just what you're describing...compare schema, compare data, generate change scripts. It not free, but it works well. NOTE: ApexSQL Diff only works with SQL Server.
I'd really love this to work in IE. I'm not able to change the fact that tables should not be used here. IE is the only browser the project I'm working on is required to support. Here's the code: I've been using the Tryit Editor to play with this. Thanks in advance for your help!

Click the triangle and select "Flame Chart". Once you are in Flame Chart mode, you can zoom and pan to see the digest cycles, how long they take, and exactly what functions are being called. The Flame Chart is so incredibly useful for tracking down page load issues, ng-repeat performance problems, digest cycle problems! I really don't know how I was able to debug and profile before the Flame Chart. Here is an example:

I recently moved from a Mac + Textmate back to Visual Studio. The one thing I absolutely loved about textmate was it's find/search feature. It made navigating solution files so easy. Is there an equivalent shortcut/addon for Visual Studio?
I'm starting my first Drupal project, pretty excited :) I have a question the project is a hotel directory site. at sidebar I have locations list (London, Manchester, Liverpool, etc..) and filter the hotels related on location click. So, how should I create these cities? Should I put them manually and give links manually depending on location id? or is there any better way to create this location list and linking filtering dynamically (via cms, or custom module, etc...) Appreciate advices!!!!
Excellent! Look forward to hearing from you.
It's not a homework, and since there is nowhere on the internet how to solve this, I came up here. @pmr Excellent proposal! :)
Wow, great many thanks! File was Data!
Excellent questions! This particular project will need DS, WAYF, etc.
Excellent point! :)

I'm working with a console application (C#) at the moment. What it does is pulls files from a database and stores them in their relevant folders on the C drive on a local machine. At the moment, every time I run the console app, it pulls ALL the files from the database. What I would like to be able to do, is each time I run it, It only pulls the files that were submitted since I last ran the console application. Currently, this is the linq statement that pulls the files from the database. Ideally I'd like something like the following where the date and time of the last run of the application is stored somewhere: I'm unsure on how to go about achieving this. If anyone had any advice on it I'd be very greatful :)
Great work in finding that bug report ticket! I was able to see the issue in the [fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/5SCnJ/) that they provided. Notice also that the bug has been fixed! All you need to do is use a jQuery-ui >= version 1.10.3. I forked their fiddle and tried it with 1.10.3 and the issue goes away. Check it out [here](http://jsfiddle.net/mcoomey/JPC4J/1/). @user3496151: The fix that I demonstrated in the previous
There is another way... As the WPF application is coded with the .NET framework, it is compiled to MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language). This means you can use a decompiler such as ILSpy to decompile and view the code of BaronReplays. This will give you some idea of how BaronReplays works so you can implement the same ideas into your own code project...Hope this helped!Rodit
Would you happen to have another column in your table where you can group them as "1 2 3 4" , "1 2 3 4", etc?It would look something like this:1st column | second columnA | 1B | 1C | 1D | 1A | 2B | 2C | 2D | 2If you order it by 2nd column, it will return 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2. But since you have another column, you can do order by 1st column, 2nd column, and it will be 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2.This ia ofcourse assuming that you have a field like 1st column. But given that you're looking at having them order like 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4, there must be something in your other fields that can help you achieved that Hope this helps!
You would need to create a counter integer variable that can keep track of the line index for you. Hope it helps!

Is your test case exhibiting this behavior in jsfiddle? I have tried it in Firefox, Chrome and Safari and do not see the shrinking you're talking about, although Chrome and Safari force a left-margin indent while dragging. (???) &#xA;&#xA;
I want to programatically detect if my site is within the Facebook iFrame app so I can display certain features specifically for Facebook. Otherwise if someone goes site without Facebook. Preferably an FBML, C# or JS solution would be great :) Thx!
You're very welcome ! It would be nice though if you upvoted and accepted the answer. This way other users could refer to it if they pass to the same trouble you had =P
@SamDeHaan, you are correct! transposed them as i was writing.
It would be a good practice to have a separate button that will disable method since it is very easy to get confused when using your program if the code for disabling and enabling this method is all written in one method named so I suggest you separate them to make the program's design more precise.Next thing you can do is to execute a , whic you are going to mark as . After having done this you can use .Here's how: Be warned that it's sometimes dangerous to throw exceptions as it creates some other bugs, but this option won't hurt much if you're just trying to disable a function. By the way, this will really not remove the method as it will just replace it, it's now up to you to choose which method will receive this. Hope this was helpful!
huh...it will be very great if modal case working in my situation!!! I can't find any example in network of this realization!!!
Excellent! PHP really is an impressive language.
If you only need the count (like you express in your original question), you could do: Hope it helps!
There are two issues with your regex pattern: Firstly, you forgot to add the ^ at the beginning. this is why only the last characters were checked, or to say: you did not check the entire input. Secondly, your cyrill check did not seem to be correct. Still, I am not used to cyrillic letters and I should be careful before I judge ;) hope it helps!
Try this: If you are really finding yourself getting interested in SpriteKit, then I suggest you expand your knowledge with some excellent tutorials. This will make your experience a lot less frustrating and put you on the road to becoming the next Angry Birds creator! Take a look at the tutorials on this site http://www.raywenderlich.com
Cool, that was going to be my next suggestion! Good luck :)
You can use this Hope this helps!
that's great :)
Indeed your question is an easy one, so I answer your question with some additional points that I think help you more than the answer itself:First, this is the code: Notes: Please1 - don't a simple problem a real hard one! if it's a hw you can convince the tutor about defining the string delimited with something like "," (if he/she insists) or whatever, and if this is a real project convince the customer, you don't want to torture yourself! 2 - you said you want to split the string into a 4 x 4 matrix, what if you want a 5x5 matrix? So take advantage of constants, and the same for the delimiter Hope these help.
How do you train Neural Network for pattern recognition? For example a face recognition in a picture how would you define the output neurons? (eg. how to detect where is the face exactly, rather than just saying that there is a face in camera). Also, how about detecting multiple faces and different size of faces? If anyone could give me a pointer it would be really great Cheers!
I am learning ML. Can some one please help me out with basic input/output functions in ML?? I just want to read input from console and store it in a variable and use it in my ML program. Please help. If you can point me towards some example for this also it would be super great!!! Thank you.
the question just came to me from a different team. The question was "how to query the users in the exchange server's particular User group". Its said that the Exchange server user group is not linked to an Ad group. The examples i could get are all for querying based on AD group. I heard there are two ways either through SQL or through DirectoryServices. Either solution is fine, but through DirectoryServices will be super awesome! Thanks again!
@PeterGrantBue: I'm happy that my solution suits your needs. :-) Please, accept my answer if it really helped you out. Good luck with your game! ;-)

I'm trying to make a link inside the fancybox single image title. I want it to redirect me to another fancybox window (witch is inline)... I have a script that makes the whole single image a link, but this targets my document title instead of the anchor title...

Is there a shorthand for a new line character in Scala? In Java (on Windows) I usually just use "\n", but that doesn't seem to work in Scala - specifically outputs in Eclipse, (sic) from the command line, and from the REPL (GREAT SUCCESS!) works, but is there anything shorter?
I have a long scrolling page, and want to test if an element is 100px from the top, then apply a class elsewhere (until the next element in line is 100px from the top) If I could just get the basic statement I would be ecstatic, anything extra would be a bonus!
@Gabriele No worries! Glad to have helped :)
Excellent point! Thanks!! I did mean just the left side though.. (I should have specified that). Was glad to learn your insight though..
You can do as followed:When your app is not started/ running and you start from an notification, onCreate gets called. When your app is running (background or foreground), and you start a new intent from an notification this method gets called: (if you are using singleTop) To detect whether your app is running back- or foreground, you can simply set a boolean in onPause/onResume: Hope it helps!

In my WinForms app (C#) I have a circle (defined by a ) that I am presently filling with a solid color.

So through an incredibly awesome coding session I managed to extract all the variables on the first try. Well, all checked out except for array since the PDF I tested on didn't have one in the Aux Info. All the data from CGPDFDictionaryRef are now in an NSMutableDictionary, so its usable. Tomorrow I'll be making the second part to put it back into the other type that is needed, CFDictionaryRef. So if you wanted to wait I'll post it up.
I'm currently tuning a large app that uses L2S using the following process (to great success!) Start SQL Server Profiler and create a trace using the 'Tuning' template that gets saved to a file. Then interact with your app to exercise the slow spots. Stop the trace then start up the Database Engine Tuning Advisor. You can load up the trace file you just created and have it suggest all sort of optimizations. I've just created 5 non-clustered indexes based on its suggestions and my app is easily 90% faster that it was before.

Loved all 3 responses! I picked Gordon's because it allowed me to do an outer join and ignore rows that had an additional filtering parameter (I didn't ask for this but I was able to implement that later). JBrooks solution was great because it had a smaller footprint and allowed me to leverage functions, and shree's one was a little too verbose for my bigger project but still did exactly what I needed. Thank you all!
I figured out, way of calling the Hub was not correct. For the time being i have modified my code as in Global.asax :- Works absolutely fine now :) Still figuring out better alternatives !!!!

hi guys I am trying to create a program to allow a user to input a sequence of brackets (one at a time) and check to see whether there is a corresponding ending bracket.

Hey Piper, I saw you posting a lot of `git` questions tonight (which is completely fine!) but just wanted to make sure you were aware of http://gitready.com and the Git Community Book: http://book.git-scm.com/ which might help you with some of your questions. The community book even has some screencasts in it. Again, feel free to ask questions here... just wanted to pass that along to you.
@ajreal no worries, I think I managed to fix it!
The following will mirror your dev DB up to production on heroku: heroku rake db:push but what you probably really need(ed) to do was run the migration heroku rake db:migrate Good luck!
Excellent, thank you! i did not now that.

@BrodieG, but together, we are infinite bliss. Didn't you feel that already? :-)
As was noted in the comments the link is: He particularly piqued my interest with this quote: "... in certain cases, you are simply better off working on getting more data, then spending your time on improving the algorithm..." Excellent presentation and presenter ()! Highly recommended for anyone wanting to start down the path of machine learning.
I use following code for displaying three simple rollover images over one main background image. The code works absolutely fine with Chrome, but unluckily not with Mozilla! I hope, somebody might have an idea to improve my lines! Thank you already very much!
wow this is really awesome! thanks for that @petert
It seems to be working really fine for me , IE , not tested but FF / Chrome it works !
Excellent thank you guys!
I'd recommend python as a fantastic general-purpose scripting language which is fairly quick to pick up. You'll find it's more versatile for system-programming than something like php, which would be another option. You might look here as a starting point: Besides, if you learn python, you can then learn django, which is incredibly awesome!

Q6: Dynamic Memory allocation: Consider the following declaration for the multi-level array, names: Create an equivalent multi-level array: dynamic_names that has all its elements and the data pointed to by its elements on the heap.

@joe Yes, if I were to declare the property and synthesize it as above, but I don't explicitly declare an ivar myself, the compiler will still actually create the ivar. So I could do `int len = [self.stringProperty length]` as you'd expect inside the clas

I'm absolutely loving BreezeJS and was so surprised to see that my Enum values were being displayed as their text values and not their ordinal ones! What I would love to be able to do is, on the client side, open the MetadataStore, fetch the enumeration and modify it's textual properties for display purposes. Is this currently possible? From my research it would appear not, but I'm wondering if there is perhaps a simple workaround. Everything I've tried has involved a large number of hacks and server-side attributes, but to no avail, or the solution just seemed overly complex and not worth the benefits.
I'm selecting data from a table where one of 3 columns matches a given search string: But I need to order the results depending on where the match was found, based on a column weighting. I.e. if the match was found in the MODEL column then the row should appear higher in the results than if the match was found in the MANUFACTURER column. With the weighting being 1-MODEL 2-MANUFACTURER 3-DESCRIPTION. All help hugely appreciated, thanks!

Hi Derick - right now, I'm running from the command line, and very soon we'll have it hooked up to hudson. We've convinced people that hudson will be fine without a physical log file from the rake execution.

I can only repeat what others have said. Parametrized SQL is the way to go. Sure, it is a bit of a pain in the butt coding it - but once you have done it once, then it isn't difficult to cut and paste that code, and making the modifications you need. We have a lot of .Net applications that allow web site visitors specify a whole range of search criteria, and the code builds the SQL Select statement on the fly - but everything that could have been entered by a user goes into a parameter.
Does anyone know how to add an item to a list but do it so it's ordered alphabetically using jQuery?

Hi there, I was able to set the focus back on the selected item after some research on similar issue. All i needed to do was, call the BeginInvoke method on the Dispatcher property of the Listbox and do the focus setting on the selecteditem in the listbox in the delegate method call which is as below: box.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(DispatcherPriority.System.Idle, new focus(SetFocus),box); Where focus is the delegate and SetFocus is the delegate method where i get the selected item from the listbox and set focus on the corresponding listboxitem. Hope this helps!! Regards, Sowmi

I think the question is valid. I agree with the other responses, but it doesn't mean it's a terrible question. I've only ever had to use a Safari CSS hack once as a temporary solution and later got rid of it. I agree that you shouldn't have to target just Safari, but no harm in knowing how to do it. FYI, this hack only targets Safari 3, and also targets Opera 9.

great answer - this code works like a charm on Mac OSX! :-) doing a few settings up front removes code duplication when accessing settings from many places, see http://developer.qt.nokia.com/doc/qt-4.8/qsettings.html#basic-usage
that's the hope :)
Hi I have designed a query that returns a set of data such as: What I want to do in SQL Reporting Services is to display data in a grid fashion. Such as For the dataset I provide. I want it to auto page break when needed, etc. Is there anything built in that I can use? Any recommendations on how to do this is greatly appreicated! Thanks.
The named scopes already proposed are pretty fine. The clasic way to do it would be:
Then perhaps Might be of some help. If need be you could always do the registry editing yourself via API directly for the association... but up to you EDIT: Also read the comments there, some good points eg the use of quotes for paths with spaces: @"C:\SomePath\MyApp.exe ""%1""" Also permission issues for registry access esp with Vista... good luck :)
That is really, really, really smart! Thanks.
I just came across the following answer on another question: Hope that helps!
not for my company, so I don't have to worry ;-)
I just started using cdb and I love it! I've found and a few interesting articles I've found on using cdb, but I'd love to see other peoples resources. What sites do you use to extract the max usefulness from cdb (windbg)
There is a book called which details pen and paper drawing and what you can gain from it. I think it has a lot of benefits, particularly that you can, very early on (and easily), modify what the end result will be without much effort, and then start off on the right foot.
By creating datastore models that inherit from the Expando class I can make my model-entities/instances have dynamic properties. That is great! But what I want is the names of these dynamic properties to be determined at runtime. Is that possible? For example, Is this possible? If yes, how to do this? I have already tried some funny ways to do this but did not succeed :P Thanks in advance.
Wow! 3 lines of code instead of a page... I wish I could vote +5.
Came here to improve my home-grown image resizer and discovered The ImageResizer Library. It's EXCELLENT. +1 for Computer Linguist!
Great! I don't know why but accepted answer is not working. Do you know why?
The paper is an excellent discussion on branching patterns such as the "main line" pattern you mention - it lists the options in the form of patterns together with discussion of anti-patterns. One of the authors is Robert Orenstein of Perforce.
Good question. I noticed method entry breakpoints slow things down considerably when I'm debugging Java programs with Eclipse. I hope someone has the answer!
did you run out of variable names? ;-)
+1 excellent question. Personally I'm starting to think that externals should never have been allowed to track the HEAD of other repositories. Always specifying the exact revision of the external is much safer.
I am not familiar with the instance manager, but I have used on several systems (including a remotely hosted server) with great success. It supports MySQL 5.0 and 4.1.
None of the above is exactly what I was looking for, so I wrote one. super simple to use %B in the printf!
Good enough answer for me :) I get the same, lets hope they fix it soon because XBAP deployment I'm learning to love!
You can easily define a comparator for a one-level , so that lookup becomes way less cumbersome. There is no reason of being afraid of that. The comparator defines an ordering of the _Key template argument of the map. It can then also be used for the multimap and set collections. An example:
Yep, StackOverflow is written in C#/ .NET and is a very successful example of a high-scale site.

I just launched with a stack of new features, including the MP Spotlight you can see on the Homepage Every few seconds, the following code is run, which goes and fetches the next MP and fades the old one out and the new one in. Looks great! BUT If you scroll down to the bottom of the page, and wait till the MP spotlight refreshes, the browser scrolls back to #memberList Does anyone know what's causing this? How can I stop it from scrolling? Any help is greatly appreciated.
I used for a medium sized project, and loved it. It's incredibly feature-rich, has pretty good documentation, and an amazingly good support forum -- it's one of those ones where you ask a question, and a guy who works for the company that produces the software almost invariably answers it within a few hours. I used it with PHP and MySQL, but as far as I know it works with ASP.NET as well.
I am currently using the following jQuery script to highlight rows in my table, and it works great! This works great for tables of data where each row is truly a new record, however, I have run into an issue where I have records that take up two rows of data and would like to modify the jQuery so it renders something like: How would I accomplish this in jQuery where I want every 3rd row to have a class of 'alt1' and every 4th row to have a class of 'alt2'? Thanks in advance!
Wow - why would someone vote to close? This is a great debate!!

I've been programming Ruby pretty extensively for the past four years or so, and I'm extremely comfortable with the language. For no particular reason, I've decided to learn some Python this week. Is there a specific book, tutorial, or reference that would be well-suited to someone coming from a nearly-identical language, or should I just "Dive into Python"? Thanks!
If you package this code in a class library like I did, you'll have to change the access modifier from `internal` to `public`. Excellent code, saved me a lot of time.
Awesome! Thanks.

I'm trying to make our mySQL database run faster and I've analyzed our slow query log and the most common slow query is this: I'm trying to understand why this query keeps getting called because after the table is setup it should not keep happening.

Great question and great answers!!! Thanks guys!!
I'm trying to get multiple rails apps hosted under the same domain, but different directories. My configuration before attempting to host multiple apps (which works great), looks like this: I google'd around and found documentation suggesting I use the following configuration: That configuration, however, only causes my directory structure to be revealed, and no app appears to run. Any advice would be great!

I've been using a custom function for some time now to prevent clickjacking on certain sites. However, I've been surprised to find there's not a lot out there about how to do this 'idiomatically' using the various popular JavaScript frameworks. Are there users of jQuery, Dojo, YUI, and/or ExtJS that have used their framework to implement clickjacking protection? I'd love to see examples!
Jeo Clecko's SQL for smarties is excellent.
That would be really great if you share link to the example.
I'd say spike should be part of the iteration plan. not just in time. They should be accounted for the story they belong to. Even reading of parts of the manual should be estimated. And now for the hard part: don't be afraid to give high estimates. Realistic is ALWAYS better than too low. ;)

I really love the "one model in - one model out" idea of Fubu MVC. A controller would look something like this and the service locator would automagically fill in all the required dependencies in the constructor. This makes the controller very easy to test. So my question is: How would you go about tweaking asp.net mvc to allow this simplicity in the controllers ?
I love it when I find the answer to my question without having to ask - thanks for running into the same question I had and helping me work through my issues!

I know neither is true for now, but I really want these to be true. I heard that ruby-gnome2 and shoes are the top most used desktop libraries for ruby. since shoes and gtk depends on some common things, and shoes give a higher abstraction for UI, why not go a step further to merge them? make shoes totally on top of GTK. I respect different intent of shoes' creators, so, just a question to make me clear. Thanks very much for your great job!
Love this solution!
Found this on Gamasutra a while ago: Hope it helps!
Thanks Nat. The external data is large (external search results) so it's not possible to keep it as a new list. We're a SharePoint plugin so I can't guarantee that the BDC will be available at all installations. I guess I'm kind of out of luck with your suggestions but I appreciate the answer!
Somewhere on the web there is a blog post which is just a lot of scrum boards. It is really good to see how other people do it. Maybe someone can find it for us :) I think this looks like a pretty comprehensive way of doing things!
Excellent points, David. I think in Corey's case, he doesn't have an Access front end so our posts are for general knowledge that applies to most Access developers.
I have a product selection page where you choose a phone and a plan using radio buttons and I need jQuery to display the "current selection". For example I have 2 phones with two plans: Nokia N95 and Nokia N96, $35/month and $50/month Each of these 'options' has it's own radio button. When N95 and the $50/month plan are selected I need to display this information in a div: Your Current Order Phone: Nokia N95 Plan: $50/month Any help would be greatly appreciated! :)
Excellent, well thought out and worded question. +1, more if it were only possible!
Great question! :)
Wow! That was an astoundingly fast and informative response by all! I am very impressed. I will add a couple more comments below. Thanks all!
Pretty outstanding book: Gives you a good overview of the architecture of SSAS, as well as the query language MDX, and administrative/maintenance overview. A good primer for a developer OR a system administrator.
I have two tables which looks like this: Each news can only have one tag. What is the most effective way to handle inserts to the news table? The Tags table has like 50 000 rows. I'm only doing bulk inserts of approx. 300 news at a time, around 2 times per hour. I assume that i need some in-memory cache for the tags? If the tag is not in the tags table, i need to insert it and set TagID to the newly inserted id. Hope you'll get the idea!
Great answer! If I may update it to Rails 3, the json method now seems to be to_json. At least that's what worked for me... i.e. @contact.to_json

We've deployed 's Plot Pack in both ActiveX and .Net flavors with great success. Great API, incredibly flexible, provides a toolbar that lets users pan/zoom/customize. It's solid, has a long track record, relatively inexpensive, and is very fast. (I'm not affiliated, by the way.)

Marked up the question, while I don't think it's a great idea, I think its a good question to ask!
Not to take anything away from the answer already accepted, but I was able to get the duration of an audio file (several different formats, including AC3, which is what I needed at the time) using the namespace. This is part of . Adding a reference to that made my code as simple as this... And it's pretty fast, too! Here's a reference for the class.
old question, but if anyone finds this through google (as I did) and who does not want to use anchors or jquery; there's a builtin javascriptfunction to 'jump' to an element; and what's even better; according to the great compatibility-tables on quirksmode, this is !
You shouldn't worry about regular expression optimization. The call to os.system('uptime') you seem to use takes about 1000 times longer than the call to re.findall. http://hans.gerwitz.com/2004/08/12/premature-optimization-is-the-root-of-all-evil.html

I'm reading an excellent article by Paul White - ! and he uses this code: I'm trying to find out more about using dbo.Name to declare a variable, not having much luck with books online. Any ideas where I can find this? Thanks
I'm surprised nobody has encountered this issue before. It seems very painful for any medium sized project and must be horrible for larger projects.
that's the hope :)
@AlexK. excellent thought. Edited.
This works excellent, thank you very much! (Trim('0'||mycolumns))

What you can do here is hide the button that pushes the view that only instructors can see, if the user is logged in is of type student.In the view that has the button that pushes the view that only instructors can use do this:In the .h file create a property for the button that pushes the view like so: In the .m file:In the viewWillAppear method of the view do the following check: This way, when the view loads, the button that pushes the instructor view will only be accessible to the users of type "Instructor".Hope it helps!
I have a xml similar to this one: The thing is, Im able to get all the info tags, but I get the results from all dates. I dont know what the dates will be, since the are dynamic generated. What I know is that I may have a data tag with one or two date tags I wish I could show the first dateÂ´s info on a list box and the second dateÂ´s info on another listbox. How can I do that? Desirable Output: If thereÂ´s a second date then print it too: Thx!
I second trying to put the whole path instead. For relative paths, if you're doing compiling and running in command line/terminal, you need to have that studentrecords.txt in the same directory of your code files.If you're using an IDE, you need to put your studentrecords.txt under the src/ folder. This is assuming you're not in maven project setup; otherwise it should be put under /src/main/java/resources/ .Hope this helps!
You can use Mercurial on Google code now. I never tried git before but I'm loving Mercurial.

Per:https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213?hl=enYou need to be registered as a member of a Google + or Google Group that is designated for Beta or Alpha testing by the Developer. If you are not registered, you will only be able to download the production app from Google Play, NOT the Beta or Alpha version of the app from Google Play. Having the "link" won't be sufficient, you need to opt-in to the beta or alpha via Google + or Google Group. Please note that even if you properly opt-in via Google + or Google Groups as defined by the developer, you will need to wait several hours (perhaps 2-8 hours) for your status to propagate via Google Play. So, perhaps you need to wait 2-8 hours even if your Beta/Alpha status is proper?Hope this helps!

Per https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/ChangingAppStatus.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011225-CH30-SW1The "pending an Apple Release" means: Apple is holding your app version until the corresponding Apple iOS or OS version is released to the public. If you think an app should be released on existing iOS or OS versions, review the deployment target set in your app binary. If you rebuild your app binary with a different deployment target, reject the binary for this version and submit the new version.Sounds like you need to review the deployment target and if you change it, reject the binary and re-submit. If you need help with rejecting the binary, please let me know.Hope this helps!

@CodemonkeyKing, no worries! =D
My client sells jewellery in different materials such as gold, silver, oxidised, etc. When using the Layered Nav widget I would like to display the thumbnails corresponding to the selected filter. So if the users selects the 'gold' attribute in the widget, the gold thumbnails should display in the archive. Using ACF I added image fields to the main product for thumbnails and modified the action in my functions.php. I am trying to write a function that will retrieve the right thumbnail for the currently viewed filter but I cant find a way to check the active attribute for the page. I think it may be possible to use a query_var variable, but my knowledge is too limited. Any help will be hugely appreciated!

I have a table with a field that needs to store 512 characters. My question is this: can you limit the length of a TEXT field (VARCHAR stops at 255 - I can't use it) to 512 characters? If I do that, will MySQL run through the table quicker due to the fixed data length, or does it act a bit like VARCHAR in that the length can vary? I don't have a table (at all) yet, but I'm very conscious about speed and size for the future. I found this article: incredibly useful - maybe you will to! Thanks a lot, James
That's what I'm going for, I think. If you could help with the code, I'd be thrilled!

I have a few months of experience with Ruby on Rails and really loved it from the beginning on. Now, for work, I was asked to code in Grails and although I first had some objections, I now think it's a very decent framework. One thing that really impressed me in Grails are Taglibs because they make frontend modularity so much easier. I would really like to do something with Rails. Is there anything like Taglibs for Rails? If not, what are the best practices for accomplishing this kind of view modularity (and, in essence, making my life easier)?
I see. Everything makes sense now. Thanks a lot for the excellent answers!
Oh and keep up the great work Alex, I really love were you are going with EF4!
excellent - thanks guys!

@ecu - Excellent :) I added an answer so future googlers can find the answer a bit easier, it seems comments aren't looked at nearly as often when scanning for the reason.
I would go with omnithreadlibrary, it's very productive, btw. look at omnixml also, these libs are extremely helpful!
FWIW, I agree with your original method (Rails 2). Creating models just for testing them makes your tests way too slow to run in continuous testing, so another approach is needed. Loving Rails 3, but definitely missing the convenience of proxy_options!
Not sure if this is by design, but for now, from within Python causes a javascript exception to be raised and displayed (along with line and column numbers). Great success!
So this could be hard to explain but i want to do a for ... := 1 to 10 do statement but i want it to be for A to N do. The main purpose of this excersise is to load data into a string grid. So lets have it load the cells 0,1 0,2 0,3 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 with the Letter A, B, C, D, E all the way up to 14. If anyone knows how to do this i would be extremely thankful!
I've decided to use the FreeFileSync tool from There is some effort to configure it to ignore some files and folders, but the tool provides nice filter possibilities. Configuring these filters can be very time consuming but they're working fine :) Thank's for all your help!
I am relatively new to AngularJS and am loving every moment of it! I have an unordered list of products. When the user hovers over them, I need the list element to have an class set on them. I am currently doing it this way: And my showDetails is as follows: Now, everything is working just fine, however, I was wondering if it was possible to set the class without the ng-repeat and having no variable to bind to? How should I write my showDetails function to set the class this time? My first try is: But what do I do in the ng-class attribute?
oops, forgot abot that! But excellent stuff! Thanx for your time and patience nonnb!
malware from facebook?? could you explain that
No worries just making sure that you had solved it!
Excellent, now it's working! Thank you very much for your help with this.
I have a mobile web page with a table containing many rows. Each row has additional information. Ideally, when a user taps on each row, a new layer will display, covering the whole screen, that provides more information for each row. The layer can be closeable by tapping on the new layer itself. Is this something I can do with a to begin with? Or do these rows need to be divs instead? Please if someone could push me along, that would be excellent! Thanks.
In the following string, I'm trying to add an additional span around the but keep it inside the .

Result would look like Here's the full snippet if that helps: Any help would be hugely appreciated!
Thanks Scott for the excellent answer! This was very helpful. Here is a mod to the Application_BeginRequest() code that 1) uses ordinal string comparisons for speed, 2) accommodates localhost and 3) highlights an asymmetric side-effect.
@PaulMougel,Thanks Super Great! it works! I added it (res.end()) habitually and have never thought it might could be the reason. Happy New Year. Thank again you so much.
Check this thread on Joel of Software forum: Lots of excellent free icons packs!
My solution for at indexes and of any string would be: If this evaluates to True it means that the character at index x is enclosed by a set of parentheses. You can test for the index y respectively Hope that helped, Cheers! Alex
Oh! Excellent!! Worked like a charm!
@Brian - that is an excellent link!
The previous solution is really great! However, I'm looking for one more feature: is it possible to eager load last subordinate record before a specific date? This is needed so that my users can browse a history a song's votes (with links to previous and next days).

There are many ways to do this, one way is: Followed by: In general, the SQLite project has really fantastic documentation! I know we often reach for Google before the docs, but in SQLite's case, the docs really are technical writing at its best. It's clean, clear and concise.
Excellent suggestion!
Excellent solution! This is the way to do it.
hmm, not sure where to find an example.. Basically, If there could be a page in admin that I could have a text area for a user to edit that would replace text somewhere in my theme, that would be excellent!

This is amazing. Thanks so much for explaining. Excellent explanation!
I'm trying to make a page where the user can input data into four different values in four different text boxes, and the values can be stored by using local storage, and then when the user refreshes the page or opens it in a new tab, those previously entered values are still there. Any advice on how to do this would be really great! Here's the code that I have currently:
excellent, all working now, thanks !
that was from something else - that apparently the fragmentmanager holds on to fragments. But you're right - it doesn't make any difference one way or the other. Nice library by the way - extremely useful!
Short and to the point... excellent! +1
Wow excellent! Thanks so much rgeorge, that really helps.
Excellent code @ Peter, but not to be generating consecutive events, it might be better to use unbind (), like this: Thanks!

@Daniel Lee: That is an excellent video! I had downloaded Automapper, but wasn't sure how to use it on anything more than the simplest object mappings. I love how some of the concepts shown help keep the code DRY.
I'm pretty new to Angular but loving it! I am trying to create a modal dialog to display a partial view. ui.bootstap.modal has an option which takes the URL to the partial view to be displayed. I have a route configured on my application module that looks like this: I would like to show the partial template defined as from the above routes. So in my controller I'm attempting to open the modal dialog like so: The modal dialog opens but the contents are just . Do I need to define the route on the server side or can I use Angular routing to return the partial? Thanks!
I'm worndering how I can add 2 rows, of which 1 depends on another, in 1 transaction.

I have been trying to create a slider based on Nivo Slider that looks and functions similar to the Carousel found at I have viewed questions by and by , however I have been going round in circles for most of the weekend. Now back at square one and starting from the basics. Thus far I have managed to get the navigation working such that mouseenter on a particular nav item triggers nivo-controlNav to display the correct slide and pauses the slider: I also created a subsequent mouseleave function for the nav items (1,2,3 etc.) I'm now stuck at the part where non-mouse events come in. When the slider loads it should update the nav css to highlight the current nav item selected. Here is what I've got (not a lot I know, but I'm trying). Then the simple html nav menu: Any help/ideas/musings would be hugely appreciated!
Your implementation looks absolutely fine to me! A range-based away subscript is a type for performance reasons. It does not copy the indicated sub-array, instead it just points to the range defined by the you provide to the subscript.
@Rachel - Excellent! Good job they didn't use all lower case then - not sure if there would be any way round that.

I found an excellent tutorial on how to create site columns and content types - here : (THANKS AGAIN ROB!) Does anyone know of a written or video tutorial that will explain how to create a list and list instance in MOSS 2007. I use WSP Builder, and the build in templates from Microsoft aren't compatible (or up to the task). Preferably a method that focuses on the CAML (xml) , and explains in detail the theory, and demonstrates how it is done. Thank you.
So I need to get a quotient to 2 decimal places like 0.33, but do I need to use doubles all the way down or can I use integers for everything except the quotient and then just use double or decimal for the quotient? It is also breaking because of the quotient. If anyone could help me I would be extremely grateful :)

I need to do a strange task. I want to move whole android system to external SD card on Android Virtual Device. I need to do this, because android emulator, emulates SD commands, only for external card image. And I want to get SD commands trace, during Android Virtual Device usage. To be more precise: I want to move at least /system and /data folders to external storage. In such way, that system could still work fine =) Thank You!

is there anyway to have two TextView in one AutoCompleteTextView result? e.g. And so on... The ArrayAdapter only allows one binding for a view so how could I bind more views in the adapter? Like so: I've created a new xml layout for the layout parameter in the ArrayAdapter except when I bind the TextView to the string array, it only sets the text to the TextView with the given id. I've also searched through the other posts about this one and it did not suit my needs. If anyone could help that would be absolutely great :) Thank you.

I have two files. File 1: a FASTA file with gene sequences, formated like this example: File 2: A simple text file with JUST the accession identification of the gene. Like so. Every entry in File 2 is somewhere in File 1, but not every entry in File 1 is in File 2. I need to remove all the entries from File 1 that are not in File 2. I feel like there must be something in the biopython module that could help me, I just don't know what. For instance, I originally thought that I could extract just the accessions from my FASTA file using the function, but this really just lands me with two files of accession numbers. I don't know how to selectively extract the accessions that are in the other file. Maybe like reading all the entries from File 2 into a dictionary and then associated that entry with its matching entry in File 1 and use to extract the whole sequence...But I really don't know....Any help anyone could give me is extremely appreciated!

Great, excellent links. Thanks for the help!
I understand not liking XAML, as it really intimidated me at first, but I will quickly say that it is a powerful tool. I am not sure how to do it through the designer, but in C# let's say you name your DataGrid 'myDataGrid' and your List is named 'stringList'. It is as simple as the following: and the data grid is now bound to your string list.

I finally had success passing data through AJAX and returning it in JSON. However, now I don't know how to display it on my page. here is my JS: after my model runs, it echos the following as discovered in firebug: any advice on how to replace the div "board" with data from the returned JSON array would be incredibly helpful!
Excellent job including the Fiddle! I still can't quite understand the question though. Could you include the output?
Excellent news, good stuff!
Check out this though personally I recommend you the backbone - it's very agile and fast to learn + leaves you with a lot of freedom and happiness :) But imo the special thing about the backbone compared to others is the community - and no fancy feature can replace that!
Excellent suggestion Aleksey! This seems to be a common need, so perhaps the Scala gods might consider adding this to Map

I have some questions.. (See an image for more information here: .) 1.When the animation plays reverse, i want it to play faster.. Is there any way I can do this? By code maybe? 2.Also. When the animation played backwards, and then forewards again I want it to stop at 'mouseover'. How can I do this? If i put a trigger stop between them, it also stopt when it is playing backwards. I really hope someone knows how to do this! Thankyou, Kind regards, Ellen
Extremely good question! For *line 1*, it is because you cannot add anything to a list of unknown type except `null`.

Hey guys. I told my wife all options that you gave and she went for "As Required", says it sounded more formal to her, and although Unspecified matches the scenario too, she didn't like how it looked on the agreement.

Yes, as a number of the excellent responses spotted, it is (was) a homebrew fiber implementation - my first implementation of Flow-Based Programming on a PC. The 16-bit version was actually used for production work at a big US company. I didn't realize that Win32 has a fibers implementation - I'll read the article cited by Greg Hewgill. Thanks to all of you!

How can I check if I have listed all the dependencies correctly? The is an excellent tool for checking both build dependencies and dependencies by setting up a clean base system within a chroot environment. By compiling the package within pbuilder, you can easily check the build dependencies, and by testing it within a pbuilder environment, you can check the dependencies.
255 projects ! WOW ! well I can see that happening for what you do...
Thanks for the answers guys, all where to me really useful! :)
You should really check out . I evaluated it quite a bit last year and really liked it although in the end we deployed TFS2008 and so we're using TeamBuild to get a lot of the integration goodness. But really FinalBuilder had TONs of prebuilt build activities, great support for lots of environments and tools, and a nice IDE for designing it all.
We eventually dropped using Filestream. I believe we never could get it to work right with Nhibernate. Good luck!
I started wondering today if it would be possible to integrate Joomla+CB with Google apps. If that would be possible we could have one great product! The first thing that I would want to integrate is the logon-process, one login for Joomla+Google apps.

Like others I'm using larger fonts, since getting on the plus side of fifty. Most recently I started using the Consolas typeface and have really enjoyed it. Fixed width indents well. The clear differences between lowercase L and number 1 and the letter O and zeronumber 0 for example also makes this a really good programming font.
Good morning ! Is there any way to pre compile stored procedures in SQL Server? My requirement goes like this.. I have some stored procedures, which take more time in compiling than executing. So I want to precompile all the stored procedures. It would be nice to precompile them when the db server is started and running. Any ideas on this would be greatly helpful! Thanks & Regards, Pavan.

Just use Skype. It's free, it has excellent chatting capabilities, works over firewalls, supports lots of collaboration features out of box and plenty more as plugins. P.S. It is also supported natively on Windows Mobile and has good clients on other mobile platforms (like Fring on S60)
Would it be possible for you to post the code here? That would be awesome!
This is simple I hope :) When I create a new web application in WSS does it need to be on port 80 if I want to point an external domain name at it? Everything is standard in terms of IIS and ports that are open i.e. port 80 is the only one open. I am guessing if I let WSS assign a port number to the new web application surely this can never be accessed externally unless I open the assigned port? Cheers

Is there any drawback of using SqlBulkCopy?

Old question, I know, but I found it while searching for a similar answer. Unless the API has changed, the reason why harpo's answer isn't working is because is an instance method, not a static method.

I'm reading about the CallContext class (). The documentation says something about "logical threads" and "Thread Local Storage".

First: I like your approach of being concentrated on a clean and proper state handling of your application.Excellent! But, as you said: Android can kill activities and manage their lifecycle for itself. The OS may release memory allocated for your activity as soon as possible requiring you to allocate it again. This means your fragment may or may not get destroyed. As you can see in your stack trace, FragmentActivity.onCreate is called.This obviously inddicates your existing resources created within the context of the old activity are not access - able anymore. The only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context. For all other resources you should be aware and handle properly that created resources may be invalid at the time you are trying to access them.
Very annoying, but simply solved! Reason is that by writing you tell ruby: I'm giving a block to this method call... And that's obviously not what you want. Simple fix: just add parentheses to your method call:
I'm just getting my feet wet with multiprocessing(and its totally awesome!), but I was wondering if there was any guidelines to selecting number of processes? Is it just based on number of cores on the server? Is it somehow based on the application your running(number of loops, how much cpu it uses,etc)? etc...how do I decide how many processes to spawn? Right now, I'm just guessing and add/removing processes but it would be great if there was some kind of guideline or best practice. Another question, I know what happens if I add too few(program is slooow) but what if I add 'too many'? Thanks!

I just use following code right now. The table is MyISAM 90MB. terms has FULLTEXT INDEX and it is varchar(255). There are 1,000,000 rows on the table. I wonder if there is any solution which is more resource usage friendly than fulltext search on MySQL? Especially in terms of memory. By saying solution, I refer to any solution such as other types of databases, table structures etc. and if the solution would be adaptable to a standart VPS or hosting in general, it would be extremely super duper perfect! Thanks for your time!
that's great too! awesome. thank you!

If you are on 11g you are in Luck :-) you can Use SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED in the Cursor - then you are guaranteed that two threads will never get the same row on a fetch!The RIGHT WAY to do this in Oracle would be Advanced Queueing - since this will solve ALL YOUR PROBLEMS, provides synchronization und parallel execution and other benefits...Before Oracle 11 and without Advanced Queuing (if you really want to code it yourself...) You can do it like this:(The bits marked with autonomous transaction have to be called in a separate method as an autonomous transaction. If the Update returns 0 Rows it can either be because the table is empty, or because two threads accessed the same row. - So we need a separate ending condition counting available rows.

I have no clue if this approach would be feasible or not, but then there are two things you could try:1.Create a singleton class where you and the arraylist. The class might look like this: To access the list you could write: is the name of the getter method and before getting it set it. Else you might get .Also a receiver might start before the list is filled. So always check for null before you use it.2.The other option is you store the list in a cache object like Check for even in this case in the broadcast receiver before using it.Hope that helps!

If you would like to switch to different network operators - The answer is No, you are not able to do that programmatically. There is no API that supports that. If you want to switch to different wireless networks the answer is Yes, read post. If you would like to check for different kinds of connectivity states - Look . Good luck, hope this helped!
Excellent! Did you know that you can answer your own question and accept it as **the** answer. This is considered a good practice, because it helps people looking for answers see that there is an answer and it helps them find the answer. If the answer is only in comments, the question will appear unanswered.
I think that solution is now ready. Here's the code: David Wasser you are extremely helpful, thanks!
Excellent answer!! my vote is +
No worries, and +1 to your answer!
Here is an answer to a similar question: It's a complex workaround, but looks working pretty fine!
BTW - your article on "the Math behind Transforms" is an excellent read - very helpful indeed!
Excellent, thank you! I don't know when we are going to upgrade but that's a good reason to I guess.
Excellent explanation! +1 for you Sir
Excellent approach!
Excellent thanks!
@Kevin Oh, excellent! I see now that it's a fairly obvious answer, but that tool is perfect. Thanks!
No worries, main thing is your problem gets solved!
Have a look at . I've tried to get my "MSN Invite contacts" function working right now and that's what I've found this far. Works excellent!
Yeah... I'm not a huge fan. Their documentation, tutorials, and guides are pretty nice. Here's the guide: https://parse.com/docs/ios_guide#top/iOS Here's the documentation: https://parse.com/docs/ios/api/ Here's the video tutorial for PFQueryTableView: https://parse.com/tutorials/parse-query-table (A little dated but very nice) Hope this helps! :)
Please see: for an excellent fix! Much easier to implement and more versatile than the answer above.
I downloaded and read Rails As She Is Spoke, what an excellent book, thanks for the recommendation!
Is there a way to pattern match in F# so that it will check to see if both elements in a two element tuples are equal. I'm incredibly new to F#, and also new to the whole concept of Pattern Matching in general. I was thinking something along the lines of... But I guess that would be too easy hah. Any suggestions? Or is there even a way to do that? Thanks for your help, you guys are incredibly helpful!
This is incredibly useful, thank you!
+1 excellent ! I was searching it for hours...
David: +1. For a second I thought they may have been passing a `Furious Neanderthal`, or something, to Word!
I'm wondering how Boxcar works, anybody knows? I know how to do the push notification from server to iPhone, but I have no clue of how to create the server to get the @reply and dm from twitter in real time. Any suggestion on what I should look into to create the server? Should I use Twitter's streaming API or User Streams API? Any sample code, in PHP preferably, will be great :) Thanks!
thnx man, it works really good, awesome stuff !!!
Works awesome :) Thank You!
I personally use for my company and have had great luck with it! Edit oops, I didn't notice the SVN requirement, BaseCamp can help with the other stuff.
Have you looked into creating a plugin with waffle? From the waffle guys if should be possible to create a module using the servlet filter code. That would be a pretty awesome module for Play! I'll look into it when I get some spare time. https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/waffle-users/Q9aRPJitP6g
No upvotes? I'll give you the first one!! Excellent domain issue regarding these kind of apps!
Two excellent answers, thank you! I chose Andrew's primarily because I learned a bit more about knockout from it, but both are good options. I'd use RP's method to get something to use in a more generic "anything can be chosen" scenario, but I think making it a single object is probably a better fit for my uses.
Raymond Chen has a really excellent blog post on this:
So I have a facebook page and a username /llamafont so I obviously want to keep that url. I have had the like button on sub pages (you save phrases and can like/share them on FB) since before I made the page on FB. When I have added the like button to my homepage for my base url, it shows 62k likes - GREAT! However on my facebook page i only have 107 - I guess these are the people who liked the page directly on FB? How can I make the 62K likes show up on my page in facebook? Do I need to add in all the meta og: stuff? Right now I only have og:image in there. Have I screwed it up for good? Or can I make FB recognize the likes somehow? Thanks in advance!
Recently I've started Operating Systems course...now going through its contents I'm thinking about learning UNIX from its internals.Also I have completed a Computer Architecture course and really loved it.Can you suggest a good book on UNIX Internals from which I can learn the practical aspects of how the architecture designs work in a real life OS?
Excellent, thanks!

That looks like a really excellent article, thanks for linking it. :) Where are you getting stuck? Do your logfiles show attempts to access the mobile content? If you add some logging to your browser detection, can you tell when the Opera Mini emulator is connecting vs when a desktop browser connects?
+1 : as i was planning to answer but horribly slow typing speed!! :|
Excellent Answer, thank you!
aaaaawesome!!!! Thanks a lot
I have just read and I really loved to the question. Naturally, an interesting question popped in my head... How to add my own events (of my own applications) in the Control Panel -> Sounds and Audio Devices -> Sounds -> Program Events? And another related question, that I suppose should be answered here as well is... How do I play those sounds specified in the Control Panel, when the event in my application occurs?
I'd be interested to hear how this works out. You are very brave :)
wow, awesome! never knew this. Thanks again!
There's no such thing. Any such log would have to be programmed into the database, so no worries, you don't have to disable it since it doesn't exist by default!
excellent question, thanks!
+1 for actually *answering* the question.
Excellent! I got it working with your help.
Code Contracts are pretty cool, but they do have some limitations. They will only create compiler warnings, not errors. Also, this analysis is pretty slow on large projects. However, I'm hoping this technology will evolve and eventually be integrated into the language itself. It's incredibly promising!
Could you break this down for me? This looks scary :O
Thanks to your excellent instruction, I understood enough to figure out what was going on and also what was needed! Here's what I came up with. It's clunky but it does the job! Thanks again everyone.
No worries, his answer is much better!
Excellent, thanks! This was very useful to me.
Excellent, thanks for that!
I am using as templating engine and I am really loving it. However, now I have run in a situation which definitely mustbe accomplishable in a simpler way than I have found. What I have right now is this: What I am looking for is something more like this: Is there a way to accomplish this which I haven't seen yet? If I need to create my own extension, how can I access myVar within the test function? Thanks for your help!
Excellent! Just what i needed!
Excellent! Thank you so much for the thorough explanation, and for providing the demo. So `eval()` allows you to access the value stored in each variable. This is handy if you want the name of your variable to itself be stored in a variable. Handy! You did an excellent job explaining. Gold star for you. :)
I want to update two channels on Xively and I can not get my datastream to update both. I am seeing one channel being updated ("Temperature"), but the other "sensor1" is not being updated. This is my first crack at a datastream, so any advice/pointers/tutorials to look at would be much appreciated. I have looked all over and can not get this to work. I intially used the Feed API to set up one feed for one sensor, but now i want to add more sensors. Again, any help would be extremely appreciated!
Wow - excellent! How did you find this age old question? :)
This is excellent! :)
Excellent, thanks very much!
You should . It has a lot of good packages. I found these packages to help you with zip files for example: The NPM registry is really amazing :)
@Alex: Great :) Happy further coding!
Excellent! I'll make it as answer, that you can hopefully accept with a lovely big green tick :-)
after some tests i found a fast solution , you can add in top of your index page: it work very fine :)
Excellent question! I can't figure this out either. Please post the answer here if you figure it out.
John, Your solution is absolutely awesome! But, just to share, I have been using this method above until I see your ideia. So, it seems not to be the best solution for this, but for sure it is a way around.
Excellent workaround..!
No worries, just run some tests and see what fits better your usecase!
I am creating a small widget and I want to allow others to use it. The iFrame is loaded from HTTP - but I want to allow users to login via HTTPS i.e. that is - send a request for login via SSL Is this allowed within the same-origin policies or ? i.e. the scenario is that a user can integrate my javascript to their website, the widget opens and i want to allow them to login via https ?

I am designing a contact form which has a 'Thank you' message pop up on send, I need my thank you message to be positioned relative, other wise if the user happens to scroll while the animation is running the message remains stuck in place and ruins the animation. However positing the div relative keeps it in the position before it loads, what I need is a way to have the div display:none or opacity:0 BEFORE the send button is pressed, is that possible? Here is an to explain what I'm trying to achieve a little better And below is the Javascript I'm using Any help would be really appreciated :) Thanks guys!
I'm using some modifications to Glenn Berry's excellent DMV queries! However, I would like to add to the resultset the 'last server restart', or to be more specific, the date/time the statistics for (all, the specific) DMV was reset. Since it would be quite important to know last reset when looking at the statistics, I want to make absolutely sure the date/time is accurate and shown. Question: How can you get the most accurate date/time of when a/all DMV statistic was reset? Thanks! -D
We ended up rolling our own, similar to Figaro but with support for nested values, multiple files, and placeholders. It's pretty awesome: !
Just use RotateFlip: As @Dan-o has pointed out, this allows a rotation of any of the degree's in the enum. To rotate a Bitmap any angle without losing the size, you could do the following, but it's a bit convoluted! One - Add the library to your project Two - Add the XAML, WindowsBase and PresentationCore libraries to your project Three - Use the following to rotate your Bitmap any amount of degrees: Pain in the ass, but works!
I'll suppose that field() is a function that you've created to get a single field according to some conditions how about this code?: i'd be really amazed if this code is not working correctly Good Luck!

Is there a shorthand for a new line character in Scala? In Java (on Windows) I usually just use "\n", but that doesn't seem to work in Scala - specifically outputs in Eclipse, (sic) from the command line, and from the REPL (GREAT SUCCESS!) works, but is there anything shorter?
That's terrific, thank you!
No, definitely not return "object" ! WCF should make use of DataContracts and define full implementations of the request and possibly response objects for each call. See these two excellent articles on Datacontract basics: I have no idea why the developers of those services picked "object" as the return type - doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me! Marc

I know there is a lot of information out there on this but I've searched and searched and still have not found the help that I need. Essentially I'm trying to fill the entire browser window with a background image that scales itself and retains it's aspect ratio automatically at any size so that it can be viewed on any device. Here is an excellent example of what I am trying to achieve: The background image, when sized to 320x480 then stretched from 480 to 640 expands itself to the right! If anyone out there can shed some light on how this is achieved via css I would greatly appreciate it!
Drama-free and practical. +1.

Hi I just started playing with Mongoose. It seems pretty awesome! Now coming from a Django background, how would one implement a type of options field like: So that it can be set like status = Open or something like that. Or should this just be a normal String field and I set it accordingly in my app?
Loved this solution!
In my MySQL table, there is a row labeled "state". There are 3 values possible for this. How could I utilise PHP to echo "Unbanned" as apposed to "0" in state? And "Banned" as apposed to "1" and "Temp-Banned" as apposed to "3"? How would I use php to display "UnBanned" instead of 0 in the MySQL? I am using a table for this. All help is incredibly appreciated :)
Hopefully this will provide some ideas as to how to adapt a timer based approach for your needs: If your needs are more sophisticated then a TThread based approach may be more appropriate. But whatever you do, do NOT resort to Application.ProcessMessages it will only cause you grief !

I'm just working my way through Django, and really liking it so far, but I have an issue and I'm not sure what the typical way to solve it. Suppose I have a View which is supposed to be updated when some complex Python object is updated, but this object is not driven by the database, say it is driven by AJAX calls or directly by the user or something. Where does this code go? Should it still go in models.py????
THanks, I'll check them out. I'm loving that there's so many different answers to try out... if only I had the time to understand them all
I have just come across this great API: However, I would like to also retrieve the continent. Is this even possible as I can not find it. Maybe there is another API that is freely available that will offer city, country and continent? I have tried Googles AJAX API but they don't offer continent either. Maybe I going to have to just convert what I already have into continents, how?! I hope this isn't too subjective! Thanks all
I've been using the jQuery UI Calendar / Date Picker with great success over the last couple months.

Herb Sutter has a great treatment of this exact topic in Items 26, 27 and 28, "Minimizing Compile-time Dependencies, Parts 1, 2 and 3", in his excellent book Exceptional C++, ISBN: 0201615622. IMHO, this is one of the best C++ programming books available.

@Jonathan: I don't think it's the ONLY sane way to do it :p. Great answer though!

With what little I know, I'd recommend looking at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours (it uses Parsec etc.) but I'm not leaving it as an answer because it's quite possibly a terrible one. Hopefully someone who knows better will answer (and then I'll delete this comment).
How can I get an array of pointers pointing to objects (classes) ? I need to dynamically allocate space for them and the length of array isn't determined until run-time. Can any one explain and tell me how to define it? and possibly explain them how it works, would be really nice :)
Proxy (among many other meanings) is a **design pattern** -- see [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern) for excellent coverage (not intensely C++ specific, of course).

Thanks for that - I figured that was probably the best solution. Very good answer too!
In the absence of tuples, they're sometimes the cleanest way to do things. I generally hate them, though. F# has some nice syntactical sugar for dealing with them. Rather than making me deal with parameters, it treats them as methods that return tuples instead. The various methods end up returning two element tuples: It's quite handy, and doesn't make me feel dirty.
+1 excellent question
I really like Kate, and since it's a KPart, other KDE programs use it as the editor, so it's goodness everywhere! (why is everybody else assuming you use windows?)
Is there anyway to control the styling of the scrollbars of a div tag? I am experiencing some contrast issues between IE7 and FireFox 3.5.2. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Wow, it works! Thanks.
Great question! I also find myself a little lost in WPF because of the amount of flexibility it offers and have been looking for guidance in how to choose fonts, layout, spacing, colors, etc. I've had a hard time finding books or websites to improve my UI design skills, so I hope we find great answers here!
I really enjoy using Beanstalk too. I few days ago I realized an iPhone app to get access to your account info on your iPhone, this is the iTunes link: Best! Pablo
Fantastic work! You were correct to choose yours as the accepted answer. Really appreciate you sharing the script with us. :)
Agree that you should ensure that your data is properly indexed. Apart from that, if you are worried about table size, you can always implement some type of data archival strategy to later down the line. Don't worry too much about this until you see problems cropping up, and don't optimise prematurely.
Daniel Moth has a pretty good blog post about how to do this here: Best of all it is simple and free!
Excellent and simple.
ya, indeed very good thinking for a teenager!
Reviewing the MSDN docs for the functions listed , I see that the function checks with the SMBIOS table, which is referenced by a standard It appears that you indeed can find the information you seek through the BIOS. You may have to install a driver to get that information out to your program. Good luck!
Wow!! The question sounds like question for working in the kitchen. I am amazed the names used for the tools :)
I hope you were joking :) I want to collect general statistics on my typing and specifically not log everything since I'm sure to type passwords.
thanks for the great tip! I was really thinking of this because this is the only file that change per environment

I am writing a webPage using asp.net and c#. I want to divide my webpage into 2 columns such as in one I will have buttons that change the view in the other column, without "stepping on" the content of the first column. example: button 1 | :) a picture... button 2 | I tried to use divisions but I think I'm not using them properly. any help would be great! thanks!!!
i love those 8-space tabs you are using....very sexy.
+1 for the sarcasm!
I know I've mentioned this several times before but Scott Meyer's book [Effective STL](http://www.amazon.com/Effective-STL-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0201749629/ref=sr_11_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1220372978&sr=11-1) covers these gotchas in a clear way.
ROFL! Upvoted for the hilarious title! :D
(Great question!)
Use if-else inside scriplet based on the currently selected language and place appropriate "td" tags. Hope this is what you are looking for !
I answered the same question . Best of luck! As you will see, I like the tools.
Fantastic answers! Thanks a ton!
http://delta.tigris.org is an excellent tool for automated minimization of a test case.
Well, without any third-party tools, I'd say try using the clipboard ring, but roosteronacid's idea about the snippet is probably quicker. Hope that helps!
that's a really cool functionality of php i didn't know about! I'm not exactly sure how I'd actually _use_ it, but that's still cool!
I have a virtual machine running windows 2003 server running MOSS 2007. This virtual machine is not being run on my dev machine, but on a different machine on the network. I can ping both the host and guest OS from my dev machine. I just need to know, if it is possible, how to configure visual studio 2008 to deploy the web parts/projects/etc to the remote VM when I do this: Any input will be greatly appreciated! Thanks.
If you handle the RowDataBound event you can check the value of the data and modify the attributes of the cell or apply a different style in that event handler. That should give you what you are looking for. Let me know if you need it in VB rather than C#. Good Luck!
I've had great success with 's Auto-Suggest implementation. It includes PHP examples too.
Faststrings is leaps and bounds faster than the normal Delphi StringReplace function. I really hope Peter releases a new version for Delphi 2009.
You should look into the SDL library () as it supports multiple platforms and has bindings for a variety of programming languages. It also supports OpenGL. Good luck!
If you need portable Python audio library try . It certainly has a mac port. As for mp3 files: it's certainly doable in "raw" Python, only I'm afraid you'd have to code everything yourself :). If you can afford some external library I've found some here.
For all your keydown/keyup/keyboard needs, use the jQuery hotkeys plugin. Saw this a few months ago and it never fails to impress it. Follow the jump for the plugin demo ... It maps ALL keys on a keyboard including combos. Hope it helps!

Hey, I saw that you used asyncsocket to get the desired result. Any chance I could pick your brains about this sometime? I'm @suprfrends on twitter. It would be GREATLY appreciated!
goooooooooooooood!
I need some drawings in my tableview. How can i do this. Any help will be greatly appreciated!!
That's funny, this is exactly what I am attempting to figure out the best way to do at the moment. I had thought of using a ViewStack, but as I already have a lot of other nested ViewStacks being used, I was also looking into the State tag. If anyone knows "the right thing" to do I'll be very interested too!
ROFL!! I love the comparison to getting married...
If you're running on Windows, you could do something similar using PowerShell. This could be extended pretty easily to find all unversioned and ignored files and delete them. Hope that's helpful to someone!
An excellent `pushd`/`popd` installation appears [here](http://blogs.oracle.com/nico/entry/ksh_functions_galore) in one of Oracle's blogs - presumably relating to its use in Solaris.
Awesome drawing!
Wow, would have expected a quick answer on this! Well, found my own answer: you can't have more than one exception with except. See the here. Instead, they recommend creating a Filter. .
If I am using IIS 7.0 + Server 2008/Vista Enterprise, any ways from IIS 7.0 side to control the upload speed? For example, max upload speed at 1M bytes/second? Any configuration based easy solution is great! And any programming based solution is also appreciated. :-) thanks in advance, George
There's a discussion related to this and one . Essentially, you use Invoke to accomplish it. Best of luck!
Please do have a look at django-rest-framework, I just stepped over from tastypie to this new framework, works great! Especially the class based views and the browsable api! and many other advantages (e..g. to upload images)
Have you tried the and methods? There is a that mentions the approach. Also, in JDBC 4.0 Sun added the that allows you to get a unique handle on a row. The feature is supported by Oracle and DB2. For sql server you will probably need a third party driver such as . Good luck!
Great!.. works as advertised - Thanks aku. Voting you closer to the 5K mark :)
Just started testing as a CRM solution for our company. Someone asked for a Google map on the page showing our upcoming engagements. I know Zoho provides an API that allows accessing its data from the outside, but I actually need to integrate the map on the data-entry form. If anyone could provide a pointer to any mashup with Zoho CRM (be it Google MAps, Bing Maps, or any similar web service), I would be extremely grateful.
I have a string with some markup which looks like this: I'm trying to strip away everything except the anchor elements with "entry://id=" inside. Thus the desired output from the above example would be: Writing this match, the closest I've come so far is: But I can't figure out why this doesn't work. Any help (apart from the "why don't you use a parser" :) would be greatly appreciated!
+1. Brian, you saved me from hours and hours of research, great insight!
I have an application that is being built using Qt. It will be running on machines that will have two (or more) network cards. I need the ability for my application to select which ethernet interfaces for a TCP connection. Before anyone suggests it I cannot guarenteed that routing tables will be setup correctly. I know how to do this using the windows socket classes but have been unable to find anything about it for Qt. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Great link! Thanks. I might use this document if we move over to C++ in our robots.
Great descriptions of all the answers !
Thanks Greg, that looks to be an excellent document to read, I'm printing it now.
When using sIFR on the titles (.content h1.pagetitle) in my WP theme, it somehow messes up the spacing and pushes the title down. The actual flash video is the same size as the font, so I think it has something to do with CSS, though I've tried just about everything I could think of and can't get it lined up properly. Here's a link to the site: Any help would be absolutely appreciated :) Sean
Excellent method and exactly what I need right now. I wish I could upvote this twice.
Got it! Thank you all for helping me reach a great "Aha!" moment :-) ...hopefully after I spend some more time in WPF I'll understand why this works.
Amazingly useful - thanks a bunch, Aleksandar!
You may be looking for a solution similar to Josh Smith's "". In his article, he presents the following: And then uses the multi-value converters as follows: Hope this helps!
I don't think that you can... But if you can I'd love to see how!
I would like to strip everything in a string before a - and leave what's after that. For example: 15.11-101 I want to strip 15.11 and leave 101. I've tried a few different things, but can't seem to get it working, if anyone could help me out, that'd be fantastic :) Cheers Leanne
This is a great question.. my approach for solving this question would be to ask: Given a list of items, what is the popability of choosing two consecutive items from the list which are sorted. As the list becomes more sorted, the probability will approach 100%. To calculate this probability is relatively simple: I hope this helps!
I can't help, but good luck! What a great game that was. Will this be a commercial release?
Good luck!
Sweet :) Happy hacking!
I don't think that it is possible to compare a shelved version with a local version in Visual Studio, however I'll be very happily corrected on the matter.
And on that note, if there is a library out there that does, that will do fine :)
from a really geeky perspective, that is really cool!
Glad to see I'm not the only one who got that! The free book is actually really exciting; it will definitely motivate you to do peer code review.
I'm absolutely staggered by the amazing response I've received in the last 10 minutes! Thankyou all so much for your answers. Very, very helpful.
These are the tables: How would I do to list the last commented thread on top? This is currently how it looks: I can't figure this one out folks. So if someone could give me an hand that would be great! Cheers!
I found this about wrapping strings using parens extremely useful, but is there a way in Vim to make this happen automatically? I want to be within a string, typing away, and have Vim just put parens around my string and wrap it as necessary. For me, this would be a gigantic time saver as I spend so much time just wrapping long strings manually. Thanks in advance. Example: I type the following text: Vim automatically does this when I hit column 80 with the string:
Very interesting! The code it produces does not work for me but the code is definitely useful as an example. I'll mark this answer as accepted since it seems unlikely an actual reference that says more than MSDN even exists.
thank you so much as long you replace char(0) with 0 in the above this works great!
We use asp.net where I work and we are using c# as the language. Will c# 3.0 work with asp.net 2.0? Ive been trying to pick up some books on c#, but not sure which I should be buying, any help would be greatly appreciated!
I have a series of UIViews inside a UIScrollView, and the UIViewControllers for those views are not receiving the touch events. If I take the views out of the scroll view then it works. I have enabled userInteraction on the views but it's still not working! This must be possible and I'd be really grateful if someone could point me in the right direction! Thanks, Mike
I would recommend 2 things: - Calculate and combine polygons that are touching. This involves a LOT of processing and hard math, but I've done it so I know it's possible. - Create your own overlay instead of using KML in PNG format, while you combine them in the previous suggestion. You'll have to create a LOT of PNGs but it is blazing fast on the client. Good luck :)
It proved the point. They are very excited about SO now.
This project looks very promising - thanks!
Before you go that route, have you seen this: It's a series of articles about writing Effects (supported in .NET 3.5SP1) as fragment shaders that run on your GPU... Pretty neat stuff!
Ryan Oberoi makes an excellent suggestion, but it's a bit overkill for my small ASP.NET MVC web application. I like Lobstrosity's idea since it could apply to any class tag and its short and simple... just what I need. Both are good answers yet one solves the general question (involving a css framework) and the other one solves my specific need... I guess I should select Ryan's response as the solution as it would probably help others more... any suggestions?
Thank you for all the great answers! Sam & Talljoe's answers accomplished this most simply using Linq. Thx again!
Pretty much the conclusion I came up with also!
Great info! Thanks, Alex! :)
I've got a php array: I want to pass this array via jQuery AJAX, with this: And here's my jQuery: How can I pass the array, so that with the "replyMessage.php" page, I could take each ID from the Array, to do something like this: Any help is greatly appreciated!

I am running applications on my windows server that run on Java 1.4 In the bottom right hand corner, Java wants me to update. Is this going to update to Java 1.6, or do these auto-updates only put out non breaking patches and my system will still be Java 1.4 Any insight would be great! Thanks.
I loved the visualization of the race. Well done.
"Software developers are always optimists -- just look at their estimating skils!" - Love it!!
I have exactly the same issue and am extremely interested in whether you found any solution.
i am writing a flash app that receives its data over a XMLSocket. On the testmachine that worked really fine, but now the data will be ssl secured. Is there any XMLSSLSocket or something similar available? If not XMLSocket a normal SSLSocket would be a great help as well.
To convert raster images to vectorial images, I found (free) to do an excellent job (comparable to VectorMagic, which is not free anymore by the way). In Inkscape, import your image and use the Path/Trace Bitmap function. It has a lot of control. Once you converted to a vectorial image, save it as a SVG. Then, using , you can convert to XAML vector data. (Path & Canvas)
I'm trying to write a batch process that can take an MP3 file and mute certain parts of it, ideally in Python or Java. Take this example: Given a 2 minute MP3, I want to mute the time between 1:20 and 1:30. When saved back to a file, the rest of the MP3 will play normally -- only that portion will be silent. Any advice for setting this up in a way that's easy to automate/run on the command line would be fantastic!
I'm wondering if its possible to join together IEnumerable's. Basically I have a bunch of users and need to get their content from the database so I can search and page through it. I'm using LINQ to SQL, my code at the moment it: I hope that make some sense! Matt
SCSS is not __better__ than SASS, just different. It all depends on how you are used to writing code. If you are used to HAML-style terseness, then you could argue that SASS is better (less lines of code, less syntax like braces, etc). Just pick your flavor and enjoy!
Try <% if(ViewContext.ViewName == "Index"){%> Should work fine !!! EDIT : REMOVED IN BETA1 Removed the ViewName property from the ViewContext class.
This is better than mine. Didn't know you could do a string array for formats. Very nice!
The following scripting is a custom addition to this Hover Fade Button; in my version it keeps the text of the button while changing the background images through css classes only. I have able to everything except when you click on another button you get two active buttons and so on. I like the buttons to hover {span.hover class}, click {span.active class}, and remove any other buttons with the span.active class and put back to regular state. Greatly appreciate a solution!
+1 for the docbkx Maven plugin, it provides everything needed to work with DocBook in a platform independent manner. It's an excellent tool even if you are not working on Java projects. http://code.google.com/p/docbkx-tools
I agree with PW. OPAL is an excellent choice. It supports audio and video devices It compiles on windows, linux, and a few others Also - I recommend using the SIP protocol (as opposed to H323) - You don't need to use Ekiga. Ekiga is a front-end to OPAL. You can take a look at the OPAL samples, and build up from those.
Thanks all, for the quick and excellent answers. With this gentle initiation into SO, I am encouraged to use it more. Hopefully, I can help answer questions, not just ask 'em. Cheers.
Sounds like you are looking for a JSMin tool or similar. There are many tools which you can purchase, but there are also some online tools you can use: Good Luck!
Great question! There have already been a few questions that address A few:
Everytime I create a new IK handle in Maya via MEL, it creates an end effector named "effector1", or "effector2", depending on what is in my scene. I don't want to rely on the auto-name of the end effector, so I'm wondering if there is a way to either: a) name the effector at the create-time of the IK handle, or b) select the effector for a particular IK handle in MEL. Any help would be greatly appreciated -- thanks!
I am trying to construct a page layout, where the left column has a fixed width and a height of 100% (of whatever the right column is) and the right column has a fluid width.

leppie, those are great news! I am looking forward to try out IronScheme!
You could go with for free, or something like (which is EXCELLENT) if you are willing to pay. I hope I've understood your question.
personally, if you think you can do huge amounts of refactoring, why not get the other student to come and sit with you and as you go, he/she can ask questions and maybe he/she has some ideas of their own. Our industry moves fast, as I'm sure you know, so your partner won't encounter other devs as forgiving as you. I've added this as a comment because it doesn't actually answer your question about unit testing. Just wanted to give you something else to think about. Good luck!
God, that was terrible; I left the link to my library as the one I use for my own server. Should work now... : ) And, Pim, they're not entirely random; the library's for my own personal use, so I tend to just pick letters that make sense to me: [r]eturn, [s]teps, [g]radient, [f]ade count...
Hey, you guys are great, thanks a whole bunch! I will set up the environment in the cron script.
WPF is a fascinating platform to develop our next generation applications on! The ability to style just about anything, the databinding support and attached/dependency properties. Wow! But let's not throw caution to the wind because while WPF performance is great, it's not the best... yet. Definitely is a strong contender, but as developers we are still left with design principles for our front ends.
pr0n for sure :))))))) (kidding Jonathan)

I have two namespaces: 1) Foo.Bar 2) Another.Foo.Bar From a class in namespace 2, how do I reference a class in namespace 1? Using Foo.Bar leaves you in namespace 2 still... I hope this is reasonably clear! Thanks.
There is a plugin for Wordpress to help you with that. Hope that helps!
Excellent. This just saved me hours of work.
Your LogErrors method is great! Literally saved me today.
Regarding WCF/FTP/WS-Attachment/DIME: Excellent suggestions and some interesting reading. These are probably the types of long term solutions that I will end up using. However if there was some short term solution for changing the upload size in IIS7 that would be excellent. Thanks.
Thanks for the answers. I've found a great sitemap generator over at codeplex. If anyone is interested you can check it out here: Enjoy!
I have a small WPF application that hosts a RichTextBox: As shown the code snippet above, I set the font size to 14. If I copy text from this RichTextBox to Microsoft Word or Microsoft WordPad, the font size is reported to be 10.5. Similar oddities persist if I paste text from Word or WordPad. I have verified that the text being selected from my app is sized at 14. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Not only that, but as the software ages they feel the need to upgrade simply because they know, every time they reference it, that they're using Office 1997, for example. Great for upgrade encouragement! Although even better is a message on the splash screen, "Version 2008 is available now!"
Thanks to the two of you that answered. What I ended up doing (in case anyone else is interested!) was processing the openid login like normal, but NOT saving the new user to the database. Instead, I stored their information in a session var and asked them for the remaining information before adding them to the db and logging them in. Hope this helps!
Awesome sketch!
This is a great question! I would love to see some real world analysis on this.
completely agree, there are excellent answers provided here to this question
Jim did a great job!
I agree. Excellent update. +1.
I have the following code for searching multiple keywords within a document title which works fine. I want now to have a column that shows the number of keywords that are found in each title row and order in a descendent way. For example if I'm searching for "Maternity leave" I should get something like this: Name -- Keywords found Maternity Leave policy -- 2 Annual leave policy -- 1 Maternity advice for mothers-to-be -- 1 Hope it makes sense, Many thanks!
Dave, very nice!! I didn't know that was in there. Now that I know what to look for, I was able to find an article with a small code sample on how to use it: On a related note, I also found the that looks extremely easy to use.
Great! I'm glad you like it.
Awesome, that did it! Thanks David!
@StoneFree welcome to the future brave time traveller! :o)
This library is fantastic, made my app much faster, thanks !
Excellent resource:
Nick Rigby wrote an excellent article for A List Apart titled Uses fieldset, legend, label. Highly semantic.
+1 from me, I loved the leap from MFC to Qt ;)
Yes - that feature is extremely useful for writing upgrade scripts.
Works great! And you can add "desc" after the end to sort in other direction. In which case the strings will show first. I like how this solution doesnt actually pad the numbers in the result output.
Fortunately I'm doing *very* little with Office - really just trying to show the new features. Thanks very much for the link though - very helpful!
This should read: This survey tests the local metadata performance using the echo_client to drive the MDD layer to perform operations. It is run with multiple threads (to simulate MDT service threads) locally on the MDS node, and does not need Lustre clients in order to run.

"Add test(s) performing the static code analysis using CppCheck"
"apt-get" is distro specific... perhaps make it clear that this is an example and that other systems would be installed differently
"easy" is marketing; let the code speak for itself. :)
"system-provided version" or "version provided by the system"
"that all 4 projects are imported" or "that it imports all 4 projects"
"throws" should be indented an additional 4 spaces comapred to the begining of the function (private/protected/etc.)
"Toolkit" usually stands for "development tool". See e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_toolkits
"Types" is an overloaded term in programming. Is it an actual term in the source documents, or can we use a different term here? Is "type" the same as "MIB"??
"with the transition to ORM all we should care of is the real identifiers of this class, which is id" â€” that's considered to be not true. Since we(at least I don't) do not know (yet?), which operations will be performed on entities, we cannot tell, what we have to compare. Namely, we have to know first, whether these entities will be processed also with unset id when stored in collections, if so, then comparing just ids spells crazy results. Usually it's recommended to compare some unique business id instead of or along with db ID. See Hibernate recommendation related to id generation / object identity. Ok, I'll regenerate equals&hashcode using these two fields. Note: this syntax is Java7 syntax, with direct field access, allowing comparing classes with their descendants (the last thing is necessary due to hibernate design).
(btw. this field will occupy 7 bytes for our 64 bit builds no matter what due to alignment for the next variable)
(I think you could indent this line another four spaces if you want.)
(improvement) It should be possible to test this with only 2 OSTs. With a two-stripe file it would be missing stripe index 0.
(minor) could use: list_move_tail(&com->lc_link, &lfsck->li_list_idle); Don't delete the list_del_init(), which is on a different list...
(minor) I suspect these CLASSERT() lines were removed in an earlier version of the patch, but not restored when the padding was added back? Without these, it us likely that a defect will be added on big-endian machines when these fields are actually used.
(minor) Why out that in a comment instead of just using $((1024 * 2048)) below?
(style) cfs_list_add is deprecated, use list_add instead
(style) Do not use whitespace before Cc: (style) Use a single space after Cc: (style) Unrecognized email address: '$CC'

(style) convert in-between line to tabs. Maybe consider converting the whole function to tabs?
(style) I don't understand why this is in its own scope? It just causes all of the code to be indented further for no particular benefit.
(style) please add a comment here like: #include <libgen.h> /* for dirname() */

{"abbrev", "info", "line", "str"} would be consistent with the dwarf.New arg order. Ditto in pe/file.go.
+1 Also this method shows a lot of errors/hints in the code inspector (unused variables etc.) but I find it hard to refactor this atm
> Can we have 32-bit processes calling into a 64-bit BufferQueue or vice-versa? The 32-bit process would be calling in to a different BufferQueue, right?
> I think it's cleaner. We do not have to re-implement and maintain different versions start-needed-srv in each script. Just one "vdsm_init_common.sh --start-needed-srv" to rule them all. Here we disagree. But we repeat our-selves... and not progressing, so we can stop doing that... and progress... as whatever we have now is much better than whatever existed before. When a user/downstream maintainer opens the service/unit/script whatever he expects to actually understand what happens there and why, and not start to dig within application to find issues and modify downstream specific logic. At upstart of have the start/stop convention (yeah... you need something for legacy sysv, but simple if is doing the work), for systemd you need nothing as it handles the dependencies, for openrc you need nothing as it handles the dependencies. So the discussion is entirely around the sysv scripts... I do remember that debian does have dependency management based on the header of scripts[1] So we left with rhel only to handle... This is why I do not understand why we need any common application downstream specific logic. [1] https://wiki.debian.org/LSBInitScripts
> So at very least you should only check/parse patch set part, if ref starts with REFS_CHANGES, if at all. It already does this, startIndex checks for the prefix.
> The bug that I reported was actually on the change screen; I had not observed the same issue on the project page. Yep, the original fix was to fix the project page. It'd be great if we could fix both in one go.
> The flag package is ideally only imported in main. Where did this notion of "ideal" come from? The advice I usually hear (and give) is: don't register flags except from the main package, because you're mutating a global variable. This utility function doesn't touch any global variables. Isn't its purpose pretty obvious from the usage example above?
> Ugh, really? That's how I read http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/nss-mdns/ at least. > So do we need an mdns.allow parser too? Even nss-mdns discourages using the file ("Please note that usually mDNS is not used for anything but .local, hence you usually don't want to touch this file.") so you can probably just fall back to cgo if you detect its existence.
>OTOH we might grep in "$@" for "project:" and only add project:core if none was given. but then we could do the same with branch and status: default branch = master, default status = open => logerrit query would be translated to core/master/open. How about it?

1. This seems like a hack to work around a bug -- why are we reading from the pty after it is closed? 2. This hack also looks too broad -- if any error occurs we close the pipe and stop reading, while squelching the error. This seems bad. Same comments below.
A better way to do this is | awk '$2=="id" {print $4}' it suffers from less false positives on the 'id' string, and it's more efficient.
a bit weird that you have this error change in Populate but not in the constructor
A helper would be a good start :) dm-helper.c might be a useful place to tuck these :p
A side effect of the refactoring I used to create the hasWholeWorldKnowledge method. Fixed
a table of function pointers sounds good right about now...

About { on the same line? yeah it's probably on the one below.
absolute is still wrong.
according to [1] signature relevant files are META-INF/MANIFEST.MF META-INF/*.SF META-INF/*.DSA META-INF/*.RSA META-INF/SIG-* so depending on the signing algorithm used you may have to also exclude META-INF/*.DSA META-INF/SIG-* [1] http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html#Signed_JAR_File
According to https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering#Plug-ins_with_no_API, its bundle version should be evolved along with its host plug-in i.e. org.eclipse.jdt.ui, which will become 3.11.2 now. Hence, I updated the same for the test bundle. I will upload a new patch set with 3.10.101.
aChild is a ONDXPagePtr which is derived from SV_DECL_REF(ONDXPage) which has an "ONDXPage & operator*()" but the old code called operator<<(ONDXPagePtr&) which does something different than the ONDXPage& one!
Ack, yeah, that was my first way of fixing the original warning, but when I looked over the class more, I realised just removing the checks would be better... will fix.
action == 0 is Press and action==1 is SetFocus Do you plan to move this to QAccessibleWidget?? I guess that makes sense
actually I don't know why it is like this in the login but not in the logout.. I would assume it should be the same in both places, and that this one is the more robust one..
Actually it is just moved, disregard the comment on v1
Actually it seems to be line 21 that is indented wrong. The newly added lines are correctly indented inside the <ui:style> tag.
Actually I've changed this so that empty string "" will remove dependencies. It felt most intuitive.
Actually this is tricky to use an enum because this is going to be mostly dynamic based on the content of the images folder.
Actually, I realized late last night that it probably didn't make sense to specify the damage using frects, since the damage is defined on pixel boundaries (I was originally thinking frect because sourceCrop is a frect, but that's not exactly analagous). I think this should be hwc_rect_t. That probably implies that we should use hwc_region_t, except that size_t is way overkill and will eat another 8 bytes in 64-bit relative to this (since we're currently getting the uint32_t for free because of padding).
Actually, I think initLineModel() should be no-op too; the semantics of it are what happens when a different key is picked, but in this case nothing should change when a different key is picked, right? Both value boxes (constrained value and free text) are hidden all along. So I would hide them originally, say by extending the createNewLineModel() method, and implement this as no-op.
actually, if we get rid of nIndex, we would have to change a lot of code, because in this one, the Insert method returns the index of the inserted/already existing element.
Actually, in case of invalid argument the process gets started fine, it's just that it gets immediately exited afterwards (see line 95).
Actually, it seems my comment isn't quite correct. Windows has strerror(3), and it behaves like you would expect... for the C library. The Windows API calls essentially have their own errno that is retrieved by GetLastError(), and these error codes are not the same as those used by errno, and thus use the gross API (FormatMessage https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa908810.aspx) instead. I'm not actually sure what to do with the logging API here, given that Windows actually needs two PLOGs... I'll update the comment either way.
Add ": " after "successful" otherwise the detail message will be appended directly onto it without any space.
add a space after CMS so it read TYPO3 CMS 7 same for CMS8
add a whitespace before/after = when assigning $row
Add expert info if there is pad high and no pad low ? and also a generated hf with the padding length ?
Add here warning and link to the linking documentation of alternative OpenID provider and date: 05-20-2015, that Google shuts down OpenID service.
Add newline. #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add spaces inside parentheses throughout, i.e. (XYZ) -> ( XYZ )
Add spaces to relation name to match those in type definition
--add will add a value on top of another/others. The above line will replace any previous value with this one. Not sure which effect the author is looking for, but I personally don't understand why you'd want to have several download.scheme variables?
Add: When you copy a manifest object, the new object is a "normal" object -- not a copy of the manifest. Instead it is a concatenation of all the segment objects. This means that you cannot copy objects larger than 5GB in size. All metadata is preserved during the object copy. If you specify metadata on the request to copy the object (either the PUT or the COPY), the metadata overwrites any conflicting keys on the target (new) object.
Added tests for other resource type. I feel there should be a test that ensure the issue in the bug is resolved. It also verifies that the generated.xml can at least run through aapt.
Adding {{delete}} is because that was previously in this script: http://git.wikimedia.org/blobdiff/pywikibot%2Fcompat.git/d5a3b0349e0264a298d909d03455283f3f154fb2/casechecker.py
Adding to Megumi's nit: Consider initializing the value to true, and possibly collapsing these two methods down to one with an argument
Addressed by a separate change through https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/44706
After seeing this live on gerrit-review, I think this is noisy. Every change seems to have 10+ conflicting changes, which I think is just an artifact of there being lots of old, unlikely-to-merge but still open changes in the project. I would prefer something like including "-age:30d" and/or "limit:5" with a link to the full search without that restriction.
Again, no new abstract functions in the API classes, please.
Again, you must continue the original numbering and then update LAST_STR_HERE.
Agree displayable is not ideal. Looking for something that means "not internal". How about getNonInternalFieldModifiers()? Given they're hidden APIs / internal comments I suggest not wasting any time on this: my point is the comment is not as clear to me as I think it could be. Feel free to act on the suggestion or ignore. The later draft is clearer.
Agree, (it was not added as part of this patch, but I'll fix it). Hopefully we'll be able to completely get rid of these parameters...
Agreed, it would be better in a different tree. It does need more documentation and testing for other applications.
Agreed. Unfortunately board-specific modifications to agesawrapper.c files have leaked in, making this a long boring process..
Agreed. We will need to get this repo setup and populated before these changes are approved and applied on any hosts. Can anyone confirm if I have guessed an appropriate name for the repository?
Ah good point - I hadn't noticed that patch get merged. Have removed the field_exists and table_exists checks
Ah right I was in the "library" mindset, I tried to mimic what RuntimeException does. Yes if we look at what I use here, these would be useless at the moment.
ah! I had changed this routine to start from one less than the value passed but forgot to change br_init_children(). If you check fini(), it correctly passes priv->child_count. I'll fix this although it's OK not to change this as this routine is executed when the process in tearing down. So, it's probably doesn't matter much.
Ah, good catch. I didn't see the enclosing call to the Title class there. I was assuming the output of $request->getVal( 'title', '' ); was being passed to $request->getVal( 'returnto', .. ); Seems some really nasty logic going on with re-using variables and type-casting to strings etc.
Ah, ok. Let me explain a bit: The USBIP server/client is split into two parts. On the server side, there's an userspace daemon (usbipd) and a kernel module usbip-host.ko. The client has a userspace tool (usbip) and a virtual usb hcd vhci-hcd.ko. So, get_usbip_message_len is split in the same manner. The Device List, Import, .... Request/Response stuff (which has a protocl version 0x111) is the user space portion. The usbip-host.ko and vhci-hcd.ko part (aka URBs handling, version = 0x0000) is part of the kernel. You are right, I'll add comment which explains why the function got so convoluted.
Ah, the perils of copy-paste. Updated to "ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384".
Ahh that's funny! :D Good that you payed attention! Done
Ahh yes. OK. ROMCC and all that. I forgot about that jazz. On further thought w.r.t. the naming. It should really be pcidev_t, no? That would be typedef'd to unsigned int *and* used in struct pci_path? That name would be clearer. Or are we doing to try and encode all different types of devices into a simple_device_t?
Ahh, I see. :) I'm not seeing an isEmpty() method for the Cursor class. Should I check for moveToFirst == false instead? Also, while I'm on this, is there a reason we call the CursorLoader parameter CursorLoaderLoader and the Cursor parameter cursorLoader? Can I change them to just cursorLoader and cursor?
Ai, we missed a use-case here. I'm affraid that I know why this wasn't implemented yet. This doesn't check if the files inside the deleted folder have active references like is done above. See also https://review.typo3.org/#/c/33562/
all 3 log methods now do make use of the instance variables: accountCache, groupCache, groupBackend
All macros in southbridge.h are Vortex86EX PCI S/B config register offsets. They are all fixed for Vortex86EX CPU.
All the msgs above have significance that they are trying to modify PGFID. Create one message id say 'P_MSG_PGFID_OP' and log errors there.
All the names we've thought of for this suck, unfortunately. :(
Along the same vein of getting the class's METADATA_TYPE when deserializing the response, since you are checking if the METADATA_TYPE is located in the json_dict, you could reference the class's METADATA_TYPE directly. (I should have seen this in the last code review) if DriverInfo.METADATA_TYPE in json_dict: <body> The same applies for the properties keyword check in line 67.
already defined here: BasicFileUtility::$tempFN there is a @todo for this attribute to change it to "visible". as static?
Already sitting in $configdata, so no need to repeat this.
Also explain in this file why the compiler was failing, and dx's smart/dumb behavior.
Also guessing, but if multiple loops act on the same vector and that vector exceeds a cache level, then you can do slightly better by alternating the order of loop traversal, so that you do re-use what you do have in cache.
Also here, not MX/RX but instead {..., 4, 6, V, { VR }, ...} compare with "BETADIST" and "BETAINV".
Alternative? The ret pointer will be free'd outside of this function, therefore I need to return a pointer here. and *ret is assigned NULL above (instead of the g_new as before). If I'd return just NULL, it would add complexity to code outside.
am i confused, or will this get the above error "Invalid host name (docroot=" . $docRoot . "), can't determine language." ?does it need to be in an other "} else if {"?
And #include AGESA headers in a public coreboot header? Are you out of your mind?
And here, end with a single "},", and the next line becomes "}},".
And We dont have all functions available in cluster.rc (volinfo_filed, get_quotad_count, ... so on
another note for future patch: replace static references by the proper Dao getter.
any reason for not using constants from the enum? if you'll ever change the enum, this tests will produce useless noise.
Anything that needs to run in the UI thread needs to be wrapped this way, otherwise the IDE complains. It is in the UI testing doc I sent you: https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1UBVjIEYXoNVZeYT1NKjqPhCYSkU-X2lWVCrFHbXnPnM/edit?usp=sharing
Applied @NonNullByDefault everywhere it was possible
Are these data representative of the inputs that the function receives? AFAICT you're not storing individual collections in sub-pages.
Are these redundant copies of those in arch-agnostic lib/romstage.ld ?
Are we sure the the same set of changes are not required for other daemons as well?
Are you intending to add more artefact plugin settings?
are you sure about this loop, which does not run ;-)
as discussed, change it to if (ret && !mismatch) break;
As every callback is only interested at the part starting at the token, what about using frame + offset here and dropping the p - frame in the callbacks?
As far as I can tell from documentation, no exceptions are thrown. Reworking it slightly anyway (move chdir closer to _FindOrphans loop) and adding try/finally for safety against possibly careless maintenance programming.
as noted in patch set 2, message should be: CANNOT REMOVE STORAGE POOL WITH NON MASTER DOMAINS or something.
As of now, some caller assumes that the returned ref is not nil when the returned err is nil. When this assumption is not valid, as the original code shows, subsequent actions on the returned ref would cause NPE and lead to GOXDCR crashes, which caused the issue in MB-18266. Returning a metadataNotFound err here is more correct conceptually, since this code is called from query APIs for remote cluster refs, and not being able to find the ref is an error condition. It will result in more consistent and predictable behavior -- the aforementioned issue will no longer occur.
As per discussions on qt-development, it was proposed to have a 3-tier fallback. 1) Environment Variable 2) setConfigFile() 3) A generated default value based on QStandardPaths, org name, app name, binary name, etc. There was a +1 to this suggestion and no dissent.
As remember filtering name can be related to expert information - this give you more filtering options. For example "btle.crc.incorrect" and "Incorrect CRC"
as Shawn mentioned in another comment: s/wild project/AllProjects project/ more occurrences below
As things like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn are very popular right now I think we should have them in the list so that their proper icons are used. Maybe we could have an Admin -> Extensions -> configuration form for this so an admin can add new options when needed that records the name that will appear in the dropdown and where to find it's related icon. But maybe this will be a patch for a later time
As you noticed in your former review, my patch originally allowed this by the presence of a MSG_IS_ERROR flag that was passed to the callback. John suggested we leave llapi_printf() alone. Next patchset implements your suggestion with two distinct callbacks, which I find clean & flexible.
as you suggested (in person) that probably should go into a template
At least put // @todo something. Helps us keep track of what still needs to be looked at in the codebase.
bad define. This is the .h file. Please run KWStyle.
bad indent shouldn't it be SLERP instead of Slerp ? (can't change the cast of acronyms)
Be consequent with naming of method an var? isAVisible() { return aVisible; } or isVisibleA() { return visibleA; }
Be consistent about inner class references. Here you use Metadata but above you use SecureStoreLoadUtil.Metadata. In this case I am OK with either form in the class but want them to be consistent within the ~60 lines of code you have.
Be prepared that these logs won't show up. At least they don't on my Windows machine. Seems like logs outside the test itself do not appear.
Because it is used below in g_list_foreach, where gpointer is mandated.
Because it's racy. It should be guarded optimally with a lock that is not so global, but then you're talking about improvements that are in the nanosec granularity.
Because of presence of data-parsoid, this is not a new block level image. Title or test needs editing.
Because SQL migrations requires it for work on the ec2 credential table.
Because they need some more tweaking to supports booth modes: standalone and in tree?
Because total bytes of addrs should be greater than size.
Because we don't need anything that it provides (checking that the value is not None and encoding it) so there's not much point pulling it out of the loop below. Actually, we would have to leave it in the loop below as well since it uses the `env' outer variable.
Before the goto, you must update errcode. What happens now is that we fall to alloc_error label and then return a success status when actually an error happened and *dst was not populated.
Better to rephrase: If inode table limit has been reached, then better to increase the limit of ....
Better would be to have if (nGlobalError) { PushError( nGlobalError); return; } if (aInputString.isEmpty()) { if (GetGlobalConfig().mbEmptyStringAsZero) PushDouble(0); else PushNoValue(); return; }
Blah, I'm not saying to have XXHDPI passed in, I'm just saying that right here you could put the code that I put above. Like, "when computing the scaling factor, if we see ANYDPI use XXHDPI instead. This is a silly thing to go back and forth on, and it doesn't really matter much...
bodies of "if"s must be inside brackets, even if it is only one line.
Brian - We're not storing the user_token in the cache, we store the data after decrypting and JSON-decoding. If clients were passing in token hashes only we wouldn't know that it was originally PKI.
but cd() returns bool I don't think absolutePath() is a valid method call on bool
But not how it's currently implemented. Instead the interwikimap should be consulted to see whether a interwiki link is local, and as soon as a non-local interwiki link is happening throwing this exception (but as InvalidTitle of course). How is en:meatball:Foo an invalid link? I've added that to the link tests and it's fine. And en:meatball:en:Foo doesn't work as the meatball wiki appears to have no interwiki map.
but only replacing them in the copy of the string that gets written to fo? we're returning the original string? (i guess 'parse' is just misleading. we're copying to the 'tmp' file and rewriting one particular entry but returning the original of what we just overwrote.)
But that isn't true now is it, because only vendorcode/amd/pi/00730F01/Lib/amdlib.c and blob friends have: __attribute__((optimize("Os")))
But then there's no need to re-define the gwt-maven-plugin's dependencies. So either we use ${gwtVersion} as the gwt-maven-plugin version and we remove the plugin dependencies, or we keep it that way, with identical but "unrelated" versions for GWT and the gwt-maven-plugin. I'd happily go with the former (which would simplify the POM and aligns with what people should write unless they really need different versions of GWT and the plugin â€“ e.g. they use a patched GWT, or a patched plugin, or the plugin hasn't yet been released for the version of GWT they want to use, or the plugin has had a bugfix release), but it makes it a bit harder to test the WebAppCreator with a GWT RC (not yet pushed to Central), where the plugin hasn't yet been released (because it cannot update its GWT dependencies yet). WDYT?
But what we are using is oslo version. I think this should be fixed in oslo. I submitted a patch to oslo https://review.openstack.org/56211
But you are already the NAT gateway (in 1) so no one else should be using gateway address? Anyway I'm fine with -3 : please just add a comment to explain why it's -3 :)
but, that is supposed to be there. I think it's confusing having some functions being vbucket_* and some others being lcbvb_* -- so that's why the comment is there, so I can fix this up at a later commit. Let me do that right now actually.. http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/CCBC-431
By definition, nothing is required when we have macros telling whether it is present or not. To avoid having to update this file every time something in one of the implementation files changes, I would move that documentation there. This file is simply about SIMD and defining SIMD properties, not about what SIMD instructions are used in different kernels. Specific comments about verlet kernels belong in the verlet kernel code, not here.
By the way, why are you adding patches for specific platform w/o $(if $(filter blah?
c.patchSetId isn't automatically populated. You need to ensure its filled in yourself, unless you use the one that is already parsed and computed during validateChangeList() and stored inside of the commits map.
C++ style comments and I guess includ pcap.h *should* be garded with #ifdef HAVE_LIBPCAP
Call getResource() with false for the parameter loadOnDemand instead of true to be lazy ?
call the function, pass the device also into the function
Can do, will have to swap the mechanisms of how it works (from false to true), and set the default to true (ie device detection enabled)
Can I call GetMatrix w/out having called SetDataFrameObject? Add a bried usage description here.
Can the selection of the common part be moved one level higher until a Fintek chip comes along which is different? No idea if that is possible in Kconfig.
Can this actually happen? Wouldn't revision have to have _number 0, so the previous comparison would be false?
Can we get this from CPUID instead of hard coding it?
Can we not use CONFIG_MMCONF_BASE_ADDRESS for these constants?
Can we write a test for this? It seems to be an important semantic aspect of the interface, worth recording.
can you add a bit of documentation in the docstring?
Can you clarify what is meant by "ListBox => PreNotify() ..."? That doesn't make things any clearer...
can you combine the declaration of ctstr above with this assignment ?
can you move on top of the file (like other dissector file)
Can you please update the same in cli-cmd-snapshot.c
Can you wrap arguments like this (containing search pattern) in double quotes please? Fish shell (and probably zsh and alike) fails to execute it without it.
Can't we club these two cases something like : case GF_SNAP_OPTION_TYPE_ACTIVATE: GF_SNAP_OPTION_TYPE_DEACTIVATE:
cbk->mask will only contain bricks where the request has been sent. A read will never have a bit corresponding to a brick being healed on cbk->mask set, so the & is not needed. However, for writes (that also send the requests to bricks being healed), doing the & will cause that bricks that were unhealthy at the start of the operation will be marked again as bad after completing the operation, even if the operation succeeded. I think this is not correct.
Change looks fine, but please fix up this bad rebase.
change the error message to reflect that key size is big.
change this to /srv/deployment/mathoid/mathoid the duplicate mathoid is so if you have any other repos (eventually) or a temp dir, or an output dir, it can all be in the same place
Change this to throw CompileException instead. Elsewhere on failure you throw IOException or CompileException.
Change to: $string['pendingsince'] = 'pending since %s';
Changed from heap to stack based allocation, will now only allocate enough to hold idmap header.
Changed to check ahead and simply log the fact that we will not overwrite files.
changed to prefix operator++ (and further down in the code, too) I had it mostly coded with date serial numbers, but had to make functions that are available for class Date. I could only find appropiate date serial number functions in the sc/addin/analysis module, a module that I would rather move entirely to the 'normal' calc function module once the Excel-analysis-addin can be considered obsolete. IMHO that would reduce the complexity of the calc-function code. I will peg Date to date serial number conversion as a toDo item on my lo-task stack.
Check if the number of neighbors integer type can be obtained as a trait from the KdTree class. Move body to .hxx use this->m_NumberOfNeighbors
Combine both the if statements into one single if statement.
Comment is inaccurate (the code assumes stripe offset is set). /* Make sure stripe offset is in OST list. */
Comment should have a space and uppercase the first letter like in the other comments.
comment why -1, confusing otherwise to first time readers.
commit.hashCode() should be sufficient. A commit can only have one author.
compareTo on strings! Need to use version comparator, I just added comment so it will get fixed
Concatenate the calls to append: StringBuilder msg = new StringBuilder() .append("\n") .append("Can not find the %s at this location: %s\n") .append("Please provide alternative URL");
Consider merging these uncommon write barrier forms in to one function that takes flags. I think there's a bug in the later atomic function fixes that this would help address.
consider using 0.0 instead of another variable called zero.
Consider using expert_add_info and use the proto_item* returned from proto_tree_add_item(ath_tree, hf_ath_hlen, ...) so that the hlen field that is bad is highlighted)
CONTROLLARE. forse Ã¨ download, forse Ã¨ scaricamenti
Conversion was done for binary files to be stored in earlier formats. Encountering such versions isn't the case anymore with copy&paste and conversion would never be executed, so that code could be removed along with the check. If you want you can remove that code in a follow-up patch, getting rid of unused code is always good :-) Probably the reason why you had to add the check if a version is set at all is related to that, actually the stream should have the version SOFFICE_FILEFORMAT_CURRENT set so all parts involved elsewhere that do check the version get that correct. Would be nice if you could spot the place where that should be done. Anyhow, I'll push the current patch as is.
Copied from sys_openbsd_386s.s and missed - fixed :)
Copy the password hash from $oldCentral to $newCentral? You should probably run that idea past Chris first.
Correct, I mentioned in the commit message that it's undocumented.
Cosmetic: According to last changes related to tvb_captured_length and tvb_reported_length it is good point to start thinking about "reported" case (btsnoop format provide both frame length). In "reported" case we can have only part of frame: for example first 2 bytes. This dissector will fail at this line, so nothing will be dissected, but if you move lines 131-140,(169)171-181 directly before place when it will be use then we can dissect some fields. "context" can be filled somewhere about line current 202, "rf_channel" can be put between lines 144-145, "aa_offenses" can be fetch after 170 or where "context" is filled, the problem is "flags", but after moved it after line 147 you are able to decode "btle_rf_channel" field etc.
Could be if (!isset($colPos) || $cRow['colPos'] !== $colPos) { since colPos is set using $cRow['colPos'], thus the type must be the same. Just have to remove $colPos = '' a few lines before.
could this moved to config.h instead of having it on the command line?
Could we have a single definition of such constants? :-) Perhaps some org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.StringConstants class?
Could you add a quick comment, something like "Return any uncommitted resources"? It took me 2 minutes to figure this out even though I know most of this code already.
Could you add another test which uses line breaks after "${" and before "}"?
Could you also update RELEASE_NOTES.markdown in the project root. You are adding interfaces, it would be great to document them there.
could you explain why we need wrap this code in GuiActionRunner?
Could you factor the whole function out into reboot_service_impl so we don't need to gotos?
Couldn't this be simplified inline to rebalance_completed () ? Please note rebalance_completed has a bug, you should only check for 'completed' status instead of inversing for 'in progress'.
cpu_allocation_ratio is a global config option fro the core filter - not a per hypervisor setting ?
Create static BugzillaRestCreateTaskSchema.getFieldNameFromAttributeName() and add an ImmutableMap
cscope is again not showing me external callers in this series of patches. :( Who is using this?
ctr is not something that we would want to call out in UI as users may not understand what it is about. Please use the expanded form in all cases.
Currently the array is always allocated with new if own_arrays_ is true. Also delete nullptr is defined to be a NOP.
Currently, bucket name cannot contain symbols from html. That is why I remove escaping.
Damn it, that wasn't supposed to be there. I'll remove it.
Dan (and me) like "Vdsm" - we already discussed this few month ago.
debug print but not errant, and commented out. i got tired of putting back every time i came to this routine.
declaration of "tv" can put in this block, but it's not kernel code so it's not a big deal.
#NAME?
dev_find_slot() explicitly returns a 0 (yeah, it's the same as a NULL). Maybe that should be changed to return a NULL, but at this point, I think checking for 0 is reasonable. yes, if it's 0, we still reach the code. I've changed it to not dereference it before checking it though.
DHT_MSG_INODE_LK_ERROR sounds similar. Can that be used instead? If you add a new msgid, GLFS_DHT_NUM_MESSAGES needs to be updated.
dict_ref (src->ctx) would ensure that ctx is not destroyed with the destruction of the @src event.
did you checked that this change is not breaks other tests?
did you want to save the three characters "urn"? not worth it IMO ;)
divider/spacer not needed any more - spaces should be created by t3skin itself
Do not remove the entire statement, SeekGroup() has side effects.
Do people really type all that junk? ;-) Anyway I added it together with how to avoid typing all that junk. :-)
Do we any chance to detect whether the call was made from outside the TYPO3 Namespace? Otherwise we'll get lots of deprecations if we call a public method from another class in Core, which is public but not part of the API.
Do we have a working solution if one still need the Gerrit-Module?
Do we need to enforce the same type for all elements in the array, or do we not care as long it's one of the string/numeric/numeric string primitives?
Do we really need a separate header for two trivial definitions?
Do you mean "will be removed from the group"? If so, I'd add the "From the group" to avoid confusion. Some might think that the user is going to be removed from the system, i.e. deleted. There are a couple of minor white spaces here (shown in red).
Do you need to check $result['edit']['result'] === 'Success'?
Do you plan to address the runtime problem with N calls to cinder, where N is the number of hosts?
Doc string needs to be changed. This does not return anything. it can be something like- This function verify detail of referenced datastore.
docstrings please and thank you :D
does that make sense? why not just leave the reservation?
Does this change apply to all uses of this rule? I suggest making this plural form optional so people can transition to using it over time rather than flooding them with warnings.
Does time_sec_to_str "format" the field better than an FT_UINT16? Or does it just add an "s" to the value (which you may want to keep for consistency).
Doesn't much matter, either way. Let's omit __vectorcall from the list of tested attributes with all clang except on Windows.
Doesn't seem like we need a loop here. We can use local->pending[rb_index][idx] = hton32(1);
Doing a blind re.replace on an XML is a bug waiting to happen. The XML has structure and it is safer to use it. Please parse the XML and replace only the element you expect. Unless, of course, you have a particular intention here.
Done (gerrit tells me off if the commit subject is too long: (W) 873ed2c: commit subject >65 characters; use shorter first paragraph but does the go project really care?)
Done (hopefully the text is also otherwise a bit clearer).
Done in https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/38303
Done it looks like Gerrit missing a feature: remove comments, that don't make any sense, like these below ;-) Thanks for the hint with java_library and resource.
Done P.S: I was confused between EBADF and EBADFD. Then I tried to be consistent as I see libgfapi returning EBADFD in several other glfs_* methods when glfs_resolve_fd() fails.
Done, added QT_DEPRECATED_SINCE check, and changed to QT_DEPRECATED
Done, although this filter is specialized for 3D only.
Done. While writing the function I've also unpacked it from the current one-line version into a lengthier but more easily read equivalent using if-else.
Done. Wonder why checkstyle did not complain here this time.
don't confuse algorithm with implementation. env is not supposed to be used this way as it's touched from different places. it was said many times that using env to pass data between different codepaths is a bad idea.
Don't encode the value right away. Instead we should lazily encode the value only when the serialization stream needs it. Thus the constructor is just: this.object = object; this.codec = codec; this.hash = object.hashCode();
Don't introduce new types unless you truly need them; they are supposed to be equivalence classes, and the more you define, the larger the policy will grow (GS4 policy has significant bloat due to unnecessary types that get _exactly_ the same allow rules as existing types).
don't remove this comment here! the require once is obsolete only
Don't set the `idx_type` for now, as it may also contain internal errors (I would leave the code path in couchdb for dealing with it though, so that I can add it later.
Don't think this is really needed. See comments in PartialStateSystem. Also, protected fields, no no!
Don't use exceptions for control flow. Use Ints.tryParse instead.
don't use hard coded type names: link.isOfType(CoreRelationTypes.Default_Hierarchical__Child)
Don't you need to unlink all the socket files as well?
ec_combine_statfs is updates the avail size to max, with this we are not getting the correct value. In the below output, avail size should be 99.7G. root@rh1:~/workspace/git/glusterfs # df -h /mnt Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on rh1:/vol1 100G 290M 100G 1% /mnt
Either we have MetaDataUpdate that is batch-oriented or we don't. It doesn't make any sense to change the batch behavior for the same instance after it was created. Ever. So, drop that setter and add second assisted inject constructor that accepts BatchRefUpdate parameter instead (and make the batch field final as pointed out above).
Either you don't need these brackets, or you need brackets above where you do: if(icmp->type != ICMP_ECHO && icmp->type != ICMP_ECHOREPLY) { Can you make the two consistent?
Element. This one stuck out. I think the only ones to try to capitalize are "Allocation, Type, Element", since that trio is the dominant set of APIs for interacting with any sort of data from Java.
Empty space should be removed per previous comment.
Enable the deprecation log here is not finally discussed. I'm 60/40 for not logging, because the deprecation log will get extremely flooded. When enabling, only the first setting (and not all three) should be logged to minimize the flood. The logging could be enabled in the next version, and till then it should be documented very well.
Entering an invalid object size limit results in displaying an 'Internal Server Error'. If possible it should display a proper error message, saying that the limit is invalid.
ERROR: TRUE, FALSE and NULL must be uppercase; expected "FALSE" but found "false"
every bucket needs to have its own gen to avoid sharing updates/deletes with other buckets.
ewwww. Longer term, why are we not just using monotonic timers on x86? Still, this is known good, we can take it as an action item, as there might be a reason.
except doesn't this failure mean "i couldn't read the command file"? for which "no command" doesn't seem like a bad error.
Fair enough. But still deleting registry entries is wrong - you won't be able to run that program again without them. You can disable service from inside your program too http://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/winsvc/mgr.
False is the default, so I suggest we remove it. I've never seen it used before and it just made me scratch my head as to what it was for.
features.quota-deem-statfs should be allowed to reset When resetting features.quota-deem-statfs, it should be cleared when quota is disabled. It should be set to on when quota is enabled
Feedback from Michael (Pergament) (Author of this code) : It should be && according to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7432 (7, 7.4). If it is smaller than neither IPv4 not IPv6 address is provided.
Field length expected here is 2, but field below is FT_INT32. Is this an unsigned short (FT_UINT16) ?
Find a way to create the logger elsewhere, because we cannot specify in this configuration file a path where the user is allowed to write. By default, the file will be in the current eclipse install folder, but as Max pointed out, many users ahve eclipse installed in a folder where they're not allowed to write...
FindBugs is complaining about these parameters being null.
First, we'd need to fix grompp, since it wrote this file ;-)
FIXME! As mentioned elsewhere, the polling wait is likely unnecessary in the OpenCL implementation.
flan I don't think we used such rules for comments though. Maybe NOTE(flan) or XXX(flan) ?
Flow control keywords must be followed by a single space
Flow control keywords must be followed by a single space
follow up? hate all this stuff getting bikeshed for weeks for that sort of thing. can you also check out 6465, 6463.
For a collection to be searchable, there has to be explicit Backend support (it's not generic, you don't get it 'for free'). So unless *you* implemented search for Gluster Volumes in the Backend, the user will not be able to search. So, unless you did indeed implement this in Backend - please remove this url parameter
For consistency, this could be named "storeInHttpSession".
For coreboot, maybe you could insert: assert(OpFlag == AccessWidth8); before the "if" to ensure that coreboot users aren't tripped up. I'm the first guy to discourage unnecessary changes to vendorcode, but this code is broken and we should somehow warn users about it. It would be even better if we could make the code fail by static analysis instead of a runtime assert.
For readability I prefer an inverted condition as guard clause.
For some reason I thought that the overflow behavior was unnecessary, now I see that it is used in case of multiple dexes. I reverted the change.
For the current situation: core plugins are developed by core team, experimental - developed by PI and Mos-Engineering teams. In the future: core plugins - certified by Mirantis, experimental - verified by Mirantis, and thirdparty - other plugins.
For the final commit remove "[part 2of 2]" and join the "ODFF function FDIST" to the first summary line.
For those tracking trunk, we cannot delete this migration. Just need to make a new migration that migrates the data and then drops this table.
fragmentDescriptors probably the most appropriate name here.
frame := getcallersp(unsafe.Pointer(&siz)) Delete next three lines. Also, given that now it's just the callersp, s/frame/sp/ everywhere, including in the defer struct field name.
From what I can gather, AsciiDoc should be camel-case http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc
Function call for single line that removes from dict?
Function is returning a guint. What's the intent of value -1? Are there cases where we cannot find the DNP header immediately?
functional changes?? I just flipped the ifs. But I just see that there's still the skipSystemDependencyCheck stuff in it.
FWIW: After the first Mod, a >= 0. b is already > 0 by definition. So the rest of this code is all done using natural numbers and thus could probably be (slightly) more efficient by using nat's directly. Perhaps next CL.
FYI this probably doesn't always work. Booleans are stored as CHAR(1) with value Y for true and N for false. Not every JDBC driver out is going to grok this as a boolean value. It would be safer to use "Y".equals(rs.getString()) in code such as this. Can't this statement also be written as an UPDATE: UPDATE accounts SET reverse_patch_set_order = 'Y' WHERE display_patch_sets_in_reverse_order = 'Y'; UPDATE accounts SET show_username_in_review_category = 'Y' WHERE display_person_name_in_review_category = 'Y'; This should be much faster to process, and every SQL server we support will grok those two small statements. And it avoids the problem with boolean conversion.
GetDate() does not return a date serial number, it returns a "formatted" number with YYYYMMDD, see include/tools/date.hxx how nDate is stored in init(), which is returned by GetDate().
'git commit --amend' and everything up until the last Change-Id line can be removed.
Given that this is a basic snapshot feature test, we would like to keep the deactivate and activate snapshots to see that it doesn't bring things down, and can happen in parallel. The code that was removed was more of glusterd handshaking than volume snapshot feature.
Good call! New code uses work_git.rev_parse('HEAD'). PTAL.
Good catch, my bad (it differs in master, see Iadfa1fb78e101e67ed47a6f3b5ea88ff12c90ca6)
Good catch. Debugging needs to be removed. Will remove in next patch set.
good catch... I should blame autocomplete :P
Good idea. Although I could now just have a single stat and remove scrubber:status? If we have a stat called scrubber:runs we can infer the status. Is there a policy though of maintaining stats? any external tools reliant upon them that would be unhappy with removal of a stat?
Good point, I missed that. Determinism is a key feature. Fixed.
Good point. I'll move to the other block of ITKDeprecatedTestDriver.
Good point. I think it is related to the change as the new message is introduced here.
Good point. We need to make sure that we use jsonrpc.
Good to know, I'd specify this in the doc -- i.e. don't touch *any* QObject
gpu_info is still available when this gets called, so it can be safely passed to free_gpu(). The only inconvenience is that if mdrun crashes or gets killed, the driver won't set the clocks back to the original values. I guess this could be an RFE - nvml could distinguish between admin and user access and tell the driver to set the clocks back after the application terminates.
Have you measured the performance difference with RegionOfInterestImageFilter?
Having nightmares about empty lines kidnapping you in an alien ship and performing colonoscopy?
here as well: if ($value === NULL || strpos()...) { continue; }
here the indentation is wrong ;-) However, the main question is if the assignments should be aligned in a line or if a single space would be enough indentation...
Here too, you can access maBaseCell.mfValue directly, since we know ahead of time that both cells are of value type.
here we are changing the default to 0666 but in open it is 0777, we should have only one. I think 0777 was chosen based on what python os module does, but could be wrong...
Here we can assume that because the if statement above checks to see what extensions are enabled. If the config option has a single entry in the list, 'all', that means all extensions are supposed to be enabled on nova. I just chose Hosts here because I wanted an extension that problem wasn't ever going to be removed. (also one that wasn't many characters)
Here, we are making a bunch of datastore calls in a loop, which could fail (or time out) and drop half of the updates. Since this is derived data and an async update is probably okay, a more robust approach would be to put tasks on the App Engine task queue to refresh each graph. Failed tasks automatically get retried. The most robust way to do the update: given a graph id, regenerate the graph from a query of all its dependencies, sort of like a makefile. Then, since it's idempotent, it doesn't matter if it fails sometimes, and we can ignore concurrency as well since multiple writes don't matter. (Incremental updates would be more efficient but trickier to get right, so I typically put that off until it seems necessary.)
heuristics should check tvb_captured_length first to make sure there is enough data to run the heuristic, otherwise it might throw an exception just checking, and prevent subsequent heuristics from claiming the packet appropriately
Hi Bob, I think the setting of screen resolution is not important as it makes no different when I changed it to smaller or larger size therefore I chose the medium size (1024x768). It's hard to figure out what date of rendering the map and it does not really affect to the embed code I will remove it from the code.
Hi Edwin thank you to have a look. I removed them, because current version of ProjectsTable already has these 2 lines content . I test this feature and find 'k', 'j', 'o' can work. with or without this feature, 'Enter' hot key can not work. we can test by https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com. I ever try to only add { keysNavigation.add(new OpenKeyCommand(0, KeyCodes.KEY_ENTER, Util.C.projectListOpen())); } but Gerrit feels not happy and give a running time error http://i.imgur.com/4pL2N.png. I guess its a bug at some corner of Gerrit. /Bruce
Hi Gregor, Continuing on from the mandatory system fields, the below code will save the socialprofile data: elseif ($field == 'socialprofile') { // For new social profiles. $classname = generate_artefact_class_name($field); $profile = new $classname(0, array('owner' => $userid)); $profile->set('title', $value['socialprofile_profileurl']); $profile->set('description', $value['socialprofile_service']); $profile->set('note', $value['socialprofile_profiletype']); $profile->commit(); } Thanks, Ghada
Hi Gregor, Need to make this accessible by adding "class='accessible-hidden'" with relevant details to labels; also add spans for hidden text; anchors with spans; buttons need to have "alt" text; etc. Please refer to: https://wiki.mahara.org/index.php/Accessibility for more details. Thanks, Ghada
Hi Mehdi, you are right. I am very sorry - I have misinterpreted the deviceRuntimeVersion as the version of DeviceRuntimeOnHostMachine.
Hi Miklos, I have mentioned the relevant comments for this impacted UT in the commit message as well. Kindly have a look. Thanks.
Hi Nigel, Is it better to use "nbsp;" instead of "."? In case other screens want to use this in the future - it's more generic. But, it's up to you. It actually works quite well the way it is. Thanks, Ghada
Hi Nigel, To expand on what Tobias said, when you change the content of a language string you also need to change its name. Otherwise the Launchpad translation site isn't smart enough to tell translators that they need to update it. See https://wiki.mahara.org/index.php/Developer_Area/Language_strings#Let_translators_know_when_lang_strings_change So please change the string name to "editaccesspagedescription4". You'll also need to change the name of the string in the PHP files and templates where it is used. Sorry about that! Cheers, Aaron
Hi Robert, Don't really need these global variables here. They're not used within the function. Thanks, Ghada
Hi Robert, I think this should be $newviewid not $viewid (as it's not defined at this point). Thanks, Ghada

Hi Tobias, Can you please fix the spaces here? i.e. for ($i = 0; $i < count($record->userids); $i++) { Thanks, Ghada
Hi Tobias, You've got a typo (lenght -> length): i.e. if (firstChildSel.length < 1) { Thanks, Ghada
Hi, so should we keep this as "local" or change to "mergeStrategies"?
Hi, Correct me if i'm wrong - but, we have 2 instances of commands in the flow you described. This means they do not share state. The change done by Arik adds messages on the canDoActionMessages() collection of each one of the commands. Not sure how you're going to have this mix.
Hint: Possible incorrect use of Apple-related terminology
Hm, alright, fair enough. Most of the code I've seen uses mw.msg(), though.
Hmm I see what you mean. Yeah it might be possible to do what you describe.
Hmm notification sounds like a QObject::signals, I'd say that's somewhat misleading. So I'd name that with something indicating the progress Bar.
Hmm, after all it wouldn't fail the test, because this thread will still do the put(lastElement) below, which is the only thing that is checked. A bit flaky imo. But it should work in the meantime.
Hmm, I still don't like these ternery operators used as statements, I would prefer using an if statement
hmm, I'm concerned about the lock contention in this function. As multiple threads will likely invoke this function, this can affect the CRUD performance. Can we simply use an atomic variable for each latency stat?
Hmm, what is this misterious newly to be created LangID value? I've put 452 but I'm not sure...
hmm, why this should be a problem? attr is a local (to this thread) storage, nobody else will see that?
hmm.. GetPosition doesn't handle errors but Seek does. :(
hmmm... this is strange... ok, we succeeded in authn, but have not yet authz, so we cannot report it here. we should report only after we have all information... where do we do authz in this case?
Ho yes, perhaps I should change the commit message ? It's because the policy was set to NEW, so it will do nothing anyway, as we are already using cmake > 2.6.0
Hook parameter. I need to print it, I think it holds the CentralAuth "Logging you in to the following wikis"
How about just moving it to RequestFactoryTestBase instead of a top-level class?
How about making MapAnonymous return null so that we only need the single check that table_mem_map_.get() != nullptr.
How about that one? Is it because you won't be able to automatically change call sites?
How about to change above line like below? trun(t, gt.client, "git", "checkout", "-b", "newbranch", "origin/master")
how about use default wikitext namespace (see getDefaultWikitextNS below) or allow specifying namespace as an argument?
How about: while (next != null && next->asPhi()->GetRegNumber() == reg_number) { if (next->GetType() == GetType()) return next; next = next->GetNext(); } return nullptr;
How are these two arguments joined together into the target string? Or maybe these should be passed as-is and let the XML RPC server join them together?
how are we guaranteeing that when we invoke this clean up there are no threads consuming these RPCs?
How come there is change for IO resources with config option of 64BIT_PREF_MEM ?
How is 'bbox' supposed to be encoded for transmission over http? Currently its encoded as a Javascript array, which is probably why its not behaving as expected.
How is determined which of the opcodes is actually taken during import of _xlfn.CEILING.MATH ? I think that's missing. Note that now that we use RID_STRLIST_FUNCTION_NAMES_ENGLISH_OOXML with the formula compiler, the tables in sc/source/filter/oox/formulabase.cxx are only provided for API support (of which we actually don't know if anyone is using it at all). Our internal OOXML import/export doesn't use them anymore, so any "only for import / only for export" usage needs to be implemented differently.
Hrm, I'm not sure how best to handle this. StackOverflow has a 'Display Name' attribute, does anything similar exist for LDAP & OpenID? I'd prefer to just show the firstname to save on space. If we end up showing the full name, I wonder if we could put the name to the left of the search bar and have the search bar expand over it when active, to save on horizontal space.

huh? namedtuple() is a new-style class (otherwise __getattribute__ won't fly for it!). Note that namedtuple(verbose=True) shows that it uses __slot__=() by default, so I'm all for the removal of this redundant line. However the commit message is confusing.
I actually fear that PHP accepts this due to some easteregg or so :)
I actually misguided you here. typeName was already fully qualified and looks enough to figure out what the message was saying and find culprits. (for some reason I thought this was the member name and not qualified). Anyway sorry about that. You may consider reverting the related change to keep it consistent and make the code slightly simpler by getting rid of maps. Anyway I will leave it up to you how to proceed.
I agree if the file exist we should skip the conversion and print a information message
I agree that a trailing "or" is missing here (though defining a function is_configured and putting the grep's in it would have been better than any commenting. I cannot say that I like duplicating bash logic in English)
I agree that we should follow master for this and projects like CTK, but it is better explicitly update sha with commits. Otherwise, upstream can update at any point and builds or tests will mysteriously start failing. Also, when checking out branches or tags, we will get the versions of CTK, etc that are known to work with that branch/tag of TubeTK.
I agree this can be discovered without the text. Deleted the comment. Same in OpenKey.
I agree with Erik the message is an non-issue and can stay as is. I was just curious about the plan to merge the other two commits. But even that doesn't really matter.
I agree with Markus - if only for code-consistency purposes, add the =array() - it is bad karma anyway to have arguments with default values preceding ones without a default value.
I agree with the above comment ... the above logic change should be in a separate patch than the channel handling
I agree with Thomas. We should benchmark if it doesn't make a measurable difference, we should get rid of the customization if that's the only reason for us to have this file. I expect by now more time has been spent optimizing the JDK's HashMap than has been spent on com.google.gwt.dev.util.collect.HashMap. :)
I already have another use case. If an app needs per package log configuration (as in JDK), this is good way to support that. So I prefer to keep it as it doesn't complicate the code.
I am sorry. I just missed it before. errno should already be set to ENOENT if resolve/lookup fails. We shouldn't map any other genuine errors to ENOENT.
i assume that the reason that the copyright is updated now is because the file was updated in 2011, but the copyright wasn't.
I assume this is not a memmap version of 16550/8250?
I assume this is something that's required if signature is not provided? If so; throw an exception here; or remove it completely from code.
I assumed you didn't care about modifying the caller's array because "resources += srcs" modifies resources in-place as well. Yay Python. So you should fix that below. Also typically in Python we strongly discourage mutable default arugments.
I believe Greg thinks there may be a performance difference depending on SSL termination in the pipeline - but I think he's wrong for our APIs and clients - we could test, or we can review after we get something working and revisit it later if there is problems.
I believe you can only have one appender configured. The file based one is more useful to me, but maybe not to others.
I can do that in an extra commit, here I only wanted to add the possibility to access the created proto_item. But if you want me to, I can add the change to this commit also.
I can't parse the part between this comma and the next one.
I checked other __construct comments and there where no such annotation.
I checked, and git does not clear the environment to run hooks. I also can't find subversion's reasoning around clearing it, so barring finding out that there's a good reason to, I think I'll just remove this line.
I could directly call processBufferedMessages here, but I did it this way to avoid duplicate code (for the logging) here and in the instance below.
I could put the finalizeForCommandLine after processExceptionAtExit. Then it doesn't change anything for LIB_MPI and that wouldn't work anyhow as you point out.
I did not get your point, please fix it as you think appropriate.
I did not make comments on all of these before because it was the same comment every time. Unless there is a good documented reason, these should all be set to ignore.
I did not suggest that the acquire/release functions would be called globally for all NI. I said "each time an interface that needs the acceptor". If the interface doesn't use the acceptor don't call acquire at startup, and don't call release at shutdown. I don't much care about the length of the list or the time involved. I am looking for code that is more easy to read and maintain.
i did some refactoring and missed changing this name. thanks for catching it
I disagree. I don't think that would shorten the code by much.
I do have KWStyle but somehow I think it only complains if I have end-of-line whitespace. I'll remove the tabs.
I do not like (long) very much, but that is something in the inode_ctx API :-/ Maybe I find the courage one day to make it a (void*) instead.
I do not like the lower part here, but if I set "launchGitK" function to be only one like this: void GitClient::launchGitK(const QString &workingDirectory, const QString &fileName = QString()) ... I get error in gitPlugin.cpp file, on line 424: createRepositoryAction(gitContainer, tr("Launch gitk"), Core::Id("Git.LaunchGitK"), globalcontext, true, &GitClient::launchGitK); he can not recognize "&GitClient::launchGitK" part any more if there is no function prototype with only one parameter.
I do not understand... I am not trying to fix the world now... all I need is to ask vdsm what is its id without having to deal with handling the /etc/vdsm/vdsm.id are the above valid to this task? the new code of vdsm-reg will call vdsm-tool vdsm-id --force and get id no matter if it is uuid or generated from anywhere else, this id is required for registration. if you then want to improve how it is 'generated' you are welcome to do so, it will not break the interface.
I don`t think that this could really happened. Because ptlrpc has single thread for rq_set, that means only one ptlrpc_check_set() could happened for a request. And ptl_send_rpc could not race with after_reply.
I don't always agree with Paul, but when I do, I'm either drunk or I have a very good reason.
I don't believe so. I was using it, but because we have messages that can be one byte long (such as a keepalive) and some messages that require as much as 32 bytes to determine others I needed something more flexible.
I don't believe that typename is needed here since there is a template present.
I don't care about the number of instances of ReferenceIndex. I want to have this cache inside BackendUtility::explodeSoftRefParserList() which is static.
I don't get it - you do not have the same keys here and in the rpm-based part. We'd like this to be a portability layer, so that Engine should not care if it's RPM or DEB. Maybe the mapping is impossible - but it does not seem that there's an attempt here.
I don't get it. How are those unused locks got rid of?
I don't know that this will actually do what you want.
I don't like either style. Don't like c here. I can change it if it helps to get this pulled.
I don't line inline styles, can this be done in CSS?
I don't see this as needing more prominence here, so much as the increase in docs is *an entire second proposal* wedged into this one. I'd vote for merging as is, and making the docs process a standalone follow-up.
I don't see where we append the rewinded header to the database file. Otherwise, when we open the db file next time, it will still give us the latest header that is not rollbacked.
I don't see why we should reject a number entry that we can "understand", just to adhere strictly to the locale, but I'll ask an expert what LibreOffice does in other areas, and we should just "do the same". My assumption is that we should definitely accept native digits, but why reject ASCII digits?
I don't think config can be null. So now you can drop the method. :-)
I don't think it needs to be set, which means it doesn't need to be in the input.
I don't think most of these are necessary. The dissector is (and should be) organized to just define functions before they are used.
I don't think so. I am not familiar with where they make a difference, but it looks like an intentional special Mac case (See MacMessages and canShowMacSheetPanel). I suspect this works fine after the general UI is up and running - and that the problem here is a side effect of being the first frame.
I don't think the comparison with the SshCommands (or RestViews) is fair. For SSH commands we have a simple lookup by command name and it is all that matters. For project rename tasks it may be (and probably is) critical in which order the steps are executed. It is not just a set of tasks that can be done in any order. For a critical command as project rename the order of tasks execution should be explicit. At least it has to be documented. Right now, one has to look in the TaskModule, then in the DynamicSet and find out that, internally, it stores its items in a list which means that the iterator() will iterate in the order of the elements as they are in this list. And this is not even documented/guaranteed behavior of the DynamicSet.
I don't think there is an easy way to do this, but it feels like these error messages should be shared with the ones from the WUI (ApprovalTable).
i don't think this is ever defined on Android. it's a BSD thing.
I don't think this is the way we should do it. The routine execute_x86cpuid is obviously *x86*-specific, and that is why it is only defined on certain x86 platforms. For other platforms we should never call this routine, but then we should add proper #ifdefs around that call. We will gradually get more detection routines, so it does not make sense to have all routines available on all architectures, but usually non-functional.
I don't think we need to have these messages in our repository of messages for GSS analysis.
I don't think we should let people modify a branch that they don't have access to, even if it is for a commit that they are replacing that used to be in another branch. Locked down is locked down, right? I see how it might be annoying to have to redo a change if you used the wrong branch the first time, though... Perhaps there is some Git magic that can let you do that painlessly?
I don't understand the problem. Without the explicit assign, and copy operator, and without the AnalysisNeighborhoodSearch(const ImplPointer &) (not needed if the setMode is done easier), I don't see why it wouldn't just work by itself correctly with gmx_unique_ptr. Sorry if I'm miss something obvious.
I don't understand why you need the boolean. This should be new_rti.SetTop(); new_rti.SetInexact().
I don't want to change the actual messages in this change for reasons stated above.
I far prefer the load/store naming since anybody who has ever worked with SIMD will know exactly what we're doing. The point is to maybe make the SIMD code slightly less cluttered, and _maybe_ make it possible to for some simple routines to be templated, not to design a new language.
I feel like these explanatory comments belong in the code, not just the code review.
I generally prefer not to be credited in source files.
I got the idea for adding such a message from your change (only you had it even more verbose adding a message per approval that was copied). I can try to incorporate this into the patch set created message, but not sure if this is easily possible.
I guess above versioning should be updated since API changed
I guess I don't need to understand why one is better than the other :)
I guess it can be interpreted that its just being pointed out that this is a dependency, not necessarily that its a new dependency. And its good to have this documented.
I guess it's because hasRole only returns boolean, and the array key is needed as well..
I guess jcuken is an alternate keyboard. How will we test it? Narayam does not support non-qwerty keyboards
I guess the big question is whether it is sufficient to test the functionality by mocking out getaddrinfo() or if we need to actually make the call. If the former, I think it could go in UT. Lets see what others' say.
I guess this change (New) will be handled in a separate patch...
I guess this must be an unsigned integer because of the way we shift bits in the next file. However, in that case the width too is likely important, and I would suggest using gmx_uint32_t for clarity.
I guess this specifies whether the file is an xvg file? Then I would suggest introducing an enumerated type instead, both because we might have more file types to test in the future, and because it's is much more explicit with FileType_Xvg than true as the last parameter in calls to this function. Alternatively, isn't it possible to decipher the filetype from the extension?
I have added the modulo because if int is actually 64 bits then the snprintf would mangle the string for values >= 2^32. OTOH it is quite unlikely that we ever see such high numbers(?), but you are right it is not really a good solution. I'll push a version that will work with 64 bits ints and the refined error message. Thanks a lot for taking the time to write the review!
I have been told in the past some compilers don't initialize all elements to 0 with 'foo[n]={0};' - I've never found such a compiler, so maybe it's an urban legend. :) memset() yup shoulda done that. Ironically I looked for a memset equivalent in glib, so I don't know why I didn't use it.
I have no idea what this means, but this is probably not the place to fix it!
I have no idea what to write here other than copying the dictionary definition of the word virtual.... At the moment it basically means entities that are not backed by a file, but defining things by what they are not is bad, and also might not be true in the future.
I have reused some cmake code I had... It should be some left over from the copy-paste :/
I have tested it with this change everything works as expected. I have nothing to say in addition to your words. Give me one day, I will try to figure out tomorrow
I have tested this race using gdb (as result I commented below code), here we are just stopping new threads, we are not destroying rpc structure/any resource. There might be already running threads which may be try to request rpc/uds calls(submit and reply) after rpc and uds stop, in this scenario i was getting error from rpc layer. I dint see any seg fault. I will try to do some more tests in this race condition.
I have the feeling that we should perhaps split the functionality here and use a separate enum for OpenCL which would indicate the forking point if a future OCL device needs different cluster size. Perhaps an overkill now, but it would not hurt.
I just noticed this: please change god_mode to override_state as in this change: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/156203/8/nailgun/nailgun/test/integration/test_capacity_handler.py
I just used take_snapshot of the patched upstream repo, but the commit message could be clearer about this.
I keep finding myself wanting to click on the link that says "Click image to edit". Can we make that part of the link?
I like calling *somewhere* rather than inline policy-conditional code. I don't like that I have still exposed policy-specific's in line 528 :/ newest_file = durable_file or data_file or ts_file I nearly changed this to pass the ondisk file set to is_obsolete() and let that method take care of (a) determining the policy-specific newest file and then (b) determining if the file under test is obsolete. But backed off because there would be a slight loss of optimisation because as it stands, the loop is never executed if there is *no* newest file. I guess a call to a policy.get_newest(file_set) would do it. But what I'd really like to do is have a policy.get_ondisk_files() method return the wanted set and optionally the unwanted set as result of a single iteration over the dir listing.
I like this test case because it is more realistic than the expression above. But then, I'd prefer that we remove the other one.
I mainly tried declaring all variables in the local-most scope.
I meant the NodeName of the element (so that the path would become, e.g., ArrayId/Real[2]). Can be postponed for later.
I meant these, but we actually print the bypassLocal value with it so it doesn't matter much. Nevermind.
I must I disagree, but it's a matter of style. Consider though documenting the fact that the other method's days are numbered.
I now believe that all paths have already done a finishsweep by this point so removing this as you did is correct.
I personally hate this! commands should not go to a redirected file. I think your redirect options should be off, on, verbose - and only verbose should add commands
I prefer the Alcatel-lucent.xylan (i will update the dicto after...)
I prefer the increased type safety of enum classes.
I put it here because i think it belongs to the Apache site more than other places
I really dislike modifying unrelated code. (All around.) All this is going to give us is merge conflicts. You're not even consistent, you left "$(this)" unchanged.
I remember seeing error like "Lproc: Attempting to register osc more than once" when trying to mount lustre file system on server node. Looks like we have this logic to avoid re-creating osc proc entry in osp_mod_init but its counterpart is missing in osc_setup(). So if we have osp loaded before osc, we get the failure inserting osc module. The error now gets hidden with this patch because lprocfs_seq_register() only warns about it and creates duplicated entry in parent's subdir link. Then subsequent lookup only finds the newly created entry and it can cause random failures.
I remember 'Url' was the suggested one but URL class itself was all upper case so I was in between. I'm changing it to fromUrl.
I removed this in patch set 2 - my use case should be handled in the (abstract) controller
I see you are calling the same $user->get('institutions') twice. It looks like this can be simplified to: $institutions = $user->get('institutions'); if ( !$USER->get('admin') ) { // for institution admins $admin_institutions = array_filter($institutions, "is_institute_admin");
I see your point, there is place for improving my original suggestion. The problem with your current code and new suggestion is: you don't respect visibility during the whole loop. But the outcome of the loop is entirely useless when current change is say a draft or when the user doesn't have ACL to submit a change for a project. Example: if this code is merged as is or with your new suggestion, and you (you don't have +2 ACL on gerrit-review, right?) would open a change that belongs to a topic, that is shared by 1 million of changes, then you would iterate through all 1 mil. of changes, just to say visible = false, right?
I see, so I'll leave it to go to /dev/null. But is it enough if our websocket proxy writes to syslog? About ">= 0.6": I monkeypatched the methods that are used by old websockify to use logger. (What I'm worried about is the fact I see duplicate lines in syslog - one line comes from "journal", the other one from "ovirt-websocket-proxy" and they are identical. I need to investigate this further.)
I see. I can probably help you with that. I would like to assert that if HAVE_USBDEBUG is available the chipset and/or mainboard does the setup in bootblock to get things at least halfway working. That or so early in romstage it is before console. I think that is a good goal to have.
I started replacing C0 with c[0] because I didn't see a significant advantage of having C0 available. But then I saw this and realized this AI naming is used in some other places. And it might be helpful to have the I..M index. I thought about creating an enum to define I to M (to use as a[I]) but of course I to M would be by itself bad names which conflict easily with other things. And I thought it would be nice to have C and A by consistent. So I also created CO..C2 not just AI..AM. I think consistency with the previous name is more important than consistency to the variable name. But it doesn't really matter to me.
I started with standard ReentrantLocks here, but when adding the lookFor...() method, I realized that that is a read-only operation, so concurrent queries didn't need to block each other.
I still can't decide whether this belongs here or in superio/winbond/w83627hf/w83627hf.h ... This applies to every romstage.c in this changeset.
I still think you also need to check that the $bi->get('blocktype') is allowed for $artefacttype->name. For example if I alter an internal media block to have the artefactid point to an image artefact I get this match: $artefacttype->name = image $a->get('artefacttype') = image $artefacttype->plugin = file $blocktype->artefactplugin = file So they are not seen as mismatched, but $bi->get('blocktype') = internalmedia so they should be mismatched as an internalmedia block can't have an image as its artefact. So we need to check not just if the plugin is correct (eg = 'file') but that the artefacttype is of the correct subset for the block (eg 'audio, video') for the block instance (eg 'internalmedia')
I suggest adding the enabled parameter (see above), so this gets enabled/disabled as well when someone calls ceph::repo: ensure => absent?
I suggest to add a wrapper class like \F3\FLOW3\Persistence\ObjectStorage and keep the API attach() and detach() stable.
I suggested to add aliases = {"-#tag"} in this comment: https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/60106/8/gerrit-server/ src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/server/git/ReceiveCommits.java@1155
I suppose this is readable, but it's a lot of boilerplate compared to having a single callback each for comments/drafts with the if in the body.
I swear I read somewhere on Smashing magazine along time ago that all pseudo selectors are less performant but I can't find such an article. I can only find these 2 references (not sure of there credibility): * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4082077/first-child-is-too-slow-alternatives/4082105#4082105 * http://www.onextrapixel.com/2012/05/03/css-tricks-how-to-speed-up-css-rendering/ I think the main thing I would say is whilst integrating with VE we should avoid them where possible. Use of first-child might invite us to use last-child and other selectors based on the idea. I do think we should be avoid nth-of-type and nth-child at all costs but I'd expect first-child and last-child to be less evil! That said browsers are getting better and better these days and we could just make the decision that we will use them and wait for browsers and VE to catch up. As tech lead, let me know what approach you want us to take. Happy either way. Please can we get the outcome documented on the coding guidelines page?
I think *both* initramfs and kernel image should be downloaded even if one of these files already exists. Otherwise we might end up with a version of a kernel different from that of the modules (in initramfs).
I think columnName is a property that indicates a column's name. I'm going more for "which column should we extract from the file". I thought about maybe columnToUse. I'm not sure because this configuration is going on a wiki page. I'll change it for clarity, we can think about it more when we do the mediawiki change.
I think he's looking for the exact string "h", the 2 is to count the terminating 0 at the end.
I think I have addressed this in the updated version too.
I think I was playing too safe here. We can probably just bound it to stackMode == native regardless of SDM.
I think I'll cherry-pick, rebase and add the bootblock.elf and coreboot.ram fixes in #750.. makefile half-baked output.
I think it is better to pass AccessScanner reference to the constructor instead of checking NULL here.
I think it is, if you read the documentation of what's happening when there's already a conversion registered, the new conversion function is getting deleted, i.e. nothing will happen. One could of course remove the old converter, but that would be bad if a conversion is happening at the same time in another thread. Therefore it's the same kind of warning as in QObject::connect, e.g.
I think it might be worth a comment up here what this class is intended to do and how it does it.
I think it should be optimizerCtx.getLastStepFor(NAME)+1, since the methods which are last modified by DeadCodeElimination are deadcode-free. Another concern is that when it is called by MethodInliner, actually we want to traverse the methods that modified by MethodInliner, not all the modified methods since last DeadCodeElimination. The result would be the same, but it may do unnecessary work in MethodInliner.
i think it's more common in Java to treat abbreviations as words when in an identifier name, so "BenchmarkResultJson" please apply throughout
I think should this be translated(m_xOffset, m_yOffset) instead, because adjusted(x1,y1,x2,y2) will make the rectangle grow
I think somebody just chose to put the AllTests class in a separate package from the other test classes. I don't know why. But they aren't integration-style tests; they seem to be closer to unit-style.
I think that this class makes more sense than the Branch class because there are several places in Gerrit where refs strings are manipulated without using Branch objects. Jgit does define some of those constants, but we cannot use jgit everywhere, particularly in GWT, which I suspect is why this class is here in the first place. We need a good place in Gerrit for these constants, and the Branch object itself is a much higher level object than this simple class (it isn't only about refs, but rather refs and projects). These constants feel more appropriate here to me than in the Branch class. I have some more changes, which I will push, which move them out of the Branch class completely. I am willing to update the comment here if need be, but this class feels appropriate to me (based on its name and location) and I don't think that "naive" comment should get in the way of that.
I think that this should be removed, and phdr->len and phdr->caplen needs to be incremented by 1 + 16 instead (see other comments below).
I think that's just a mistake in make.bash. It's better to fail fast and minimize distractions to stderr when you know you've already lost. I'd say add an exit failure here and then submit. If you feel strongly about keeping it as-is, you can submit this too and we can fix them both later if we decide to.
I think the bytes.Buffer version was more readable.
I think the cleanest style here would be to make this: class_linker->IsCompiledImageMethod(m) and then embed MayBe... into ClassLinker as IsCompiledImageMethod. It'd be nice to avoid exposing the debugger to inner notions of oat files.
I think the copyright is "Eike Stepper (Berlin, Germany) and others."
I think the expert info should point to the end_marker field itself (replace "message_tree" with "tiem").
I think the per stream flow control won't be implemented. Please double check with Mike and remove this code in case it won't be implemented (and update/get the spec updated).
I think there should be a maximum size, and scrolling should start from there. with 53 options, there would be a good case for implementing a tab-structure in the dialog.
i think there was a problem with d'tors as well. not too relevant, as we don't support unloading anyway.
I think there's a function for doing this. Maybe display_name()? I think you pass it a whole "usr" record and viewer and it figures out how to display it.
I think they are trying to match with the access control section data, which uses local because it used to also have the inherited rules from parent projects, and the local rules were in their own collection so the UI could tell them apart.
I think this $userid parameter is unnecessary, because having a User object instance implies that you're checking things for that one particular user account. Plus it doesn't really seem to be used.
I think this can be refactored (with the RTU "duplication") into the Modbus dissector.
I think this fits better as an overload in UnloggedFailure?
I think this needs to stay here? The idea is to have valid NotificationProperties We need a notification method (currently smtp and later smtp/snmp) So it cant ba validates inside smtp?
I think this should say Alias for 'gerrit remove plugin' (see line 150)?
I think this switch statement is getting big enough that this dissector should create a dissector table and have these dissectors register with it, not the other way around.
I think we only support mysql, sqlite, and postgresql in the migrations. (Mysql doesn't need this step because it stores indexes in a namespace per table. This step is only necessary in postgres and sql because index names are in a db-global namespace.)
I think we should hardcode the status since the user can only subscribe.
I think we should make it very clear that this is an asynchronous process: "Enqueues a clean up of old cache files..."
I think we use spaces instead of tabs after variable name (all @foo above).
i think we're better off just taking the auto-generated stub like we did in the original patch. it doesn't hurt anyone that there's dead code at the end because the syscall never returns, and it's arguably more confusing to be insisting on supplying our own stub.
I think you also need to add -.7em to this 24px. That number comes from the .fulltext-search left and right margins. Otherwise there is a horizontal scroll on the page.
i think you can use here getAndSetVdsStatic() to get the vds name, so we will have it in the log, i think it is called anyway for the logging infrastructure ("FINISH")
I think you could use a better method name, something like network_id_cmp for example
I think you miss the (complicated) case of a conflmict between a move in a branch vs a uncontrolling in another branch => In which case there is a deletion compared to origin on one side, and a rename on the other side.
i think you really want a pthread_once_t here instead, unless i'm misunderstanding what you're trying to do.
I think you're right that this seems only natural. I will leave the code for this commented out by a flag for now, and figure out a way to add a 'lint' mode to JSORestrictionsChecker later to warn when turned on.
I think, we should replace this by getBySeverity() to avoid juggling with message types in userland
i thinks that's the wrong one, the one that should be FROM is the "pl" library
I thought a little about this. Basically it should work like this: ImageName is null: there's no friendly name for the image, use the ImageId to list/display the image. ImageName is not null: there's a friendly name specified for the image but since it can be duplicated (it's not guaranteed to be unique), then we should also give an hint about which image it is (at the moment that's done reporting the initial part of ImageId, just as git does with short hashes). Now considering this last case if we set ImageName = ImageId, then the displayed name would be something like "myisoimagename.iso (myisoim)". Please let me know if you have a better idea on how to handle this all. Anyway (beside the image name displaying) I think that the safest way to address this now is not to set an ImageName since in fact there's not an additional friendly name to set.
i thought i was already using the guava Files class in the same file. but i guess that was only true in the test file. done
I thought of making it public bcoz, I had thought of making a itextpdf library wrapper, that can be used to export any reports in future.Like this class doesn't dictate any specific layout and provides methods to create the layout elements of choice although, it currently provides only a small number of layout elements like list,table.
I thought that handle->last_hdr_bid represents the last header that was written into the file. Is this incorrect?
I thought the point of the platform file is to make it easier by requiring only one option. Of course the user can also simply use "CC=icc CXX=icpc CFLAGS=-mmic CXXFLAGS=-mmic". If I don't specify the compiler then what's the point of having a platform file at all? I'm pretty sure gcc will never support the MIC vector instructions (compiling with gcc works but is of course useless without the vector instructions). And it seems also very unlikely that clang will ever support it.
I took out the cast. That was causing the warning I think.
I understand that right not only root is supported by engine, but I prefer that the API layer will pass to the engine all the information that the user provided. Engine may choose to ignore, for now, all users aside for 'root'. The way it's written here, is just a bug waiting to happen - tomorrow engine will support other users, and suddenly we will have a bug in the API: some users are not passed on to the engine, for some reason.
I understand you do this so that GF_FREE() under the out: label does not free the acl_xattr. The dict_unref() will call GF_FREE() already. Is there a need for GF_FREE() in out: at all? I think that only is useful for the error case when dict_set_bin() failed. It would be cleaner, and easier to understand if you do the GF_FREE(acl_xattr) above in the 'if (ret)' statements. There is no need for this 'acl_xattr = NULL' then anymore. If you do not like that approach (or if I missed something that makes it impractical), this 'acl_xattr = NULL' stetment desperately needs a comment.
I want the next item to be dequeued when the previously dequeued item has been consumed by the caller (as there is no facility to enqueue an item again). So I am using the unbuffered channel for this synchronization.
I want to keep it for now - there might be new architectures/optimizations where we suddenly realize it would be useful. Having them in config.h.cmakein is a reasonable compromise to remember we can use them, although they aren't selectable directly in Cmake for the moment.
I was being consistent with the hybrid pdf tooltip which used 'makes'.
I was mentioning the blank line. Please don't remove tk.WithExtra.
I will add a general error value and use it in this case.
I will do this for all remaining get_top_of_ram() in one go, separate from this fam10 patch.
I will remove all of the debug and most of the other messages after the VectorImage is working. Main reason to use the Logger is to print interleaved messages from multiple threads legibly. Other reason I'm avoiding debugMacro until VectorImage is working is so that I can continue to see debug messages even when compiled in Release mode for speed.
I will take my share of the blame here. We don't need equals or hashCode at all, they come for free from StringKey, and I added them for no reason way back in I5df6f0c5. And nothing personal, Sven, you know how it is when you've spent all afternoon debugging such a mysterious bug in production.
I will then await your next patch set before continuing review of this (and follow-up) changes.
I will update the currently commented font.family in another change. I will need to add the font first.
I wonder if eventually we should put these in the file table as well :) Not in this change, though.
i wonder where you see that - i don't. maybe it's not explicit enough for your taste in telling you that you are an idiot if you try? make the setup script simply refuse such qt versions.
I wonder why jetbrains repeats this code in all their bundles.
i would add a new variable with the tag name, this will make it so you can show which tags don't have any results
I would go for 2 template arguments InputIndexType (which could be by default IndexValueType or unsigned int) and Dimension
I would have put all this in a separate config file like we do in the other plugins.
I would like to rewrite in C++, but that requires all the calling programs to be C++ too. Will do that in a separate patch.
I would like to see http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/6041/ fixed up and then these headers fixed up either as a dependency for this or as a patch on immediately on top of this. #include <superio/ite/common/ite.h> #include <superio/ite/it8772f/it8772f.h>
I would love to do this. The problem is that all SSH information is only available inside of the SSH project and the server project which implements the REST endpoints doesn't have a dependency on it. Since we don't want this dependency I don't know how to implement it. On the other hand, if you have SSH enabled and you are interested in the SSH summary and connections you can retrieve this information via SSH. The REST endpoints are mainly important for installations where SSH is not available, but in this case there is also no SSH summary and no SSH connections. This is why I'm okay with the current solution of ignoring the SSH stuff in the REST endpoint.
I would prefer the previous formatting of line breaks.
I would remove the setter, and have a public getter you could always spy.
I would replace this line by $noteids = array_keys($data); as $data is associate array with key = 'id'
I would suggest changing the name of this, we actually use Neutron Drivers for spec reviews (confusing I know, given line 61 below). Since each of these has it's own review team, perhaps we can somehow indicate that here?
i would suggest LG_MSG_INVALID_ARG instead in all the places
I would very much appreciate a better name/doc/higher-level-interface. Which are the keys and the values of this map?
I wouldn't bother with bufio.NewReader, just read 100 bytes or something rather than bothering with ReadString.
I wouldn't recommend to use a percentage here.. With "This change is backwards-compatible most of the time" or "This does not change the public API..." we should be on the safe side
I'd add a guard to prevent surprises if (db.isBare()) { return null; }
I'd expect that to autounbox. Autounboxing *might* be less efficient, but it's more readable and won't matter much for a test.
I'd have to dig a bit deeper into the blame history of this file to find out. As we can see at line 154 it's being deliberately kept open, rather than as an oversight. If it needs fixing it can be done in a follow-up change.
I'd move ModelAdapterSource into the d pointer, and hide all the IPC API from the user-facing API here. That would reduce this to take a QAIM to remote, and a name for it, everything else can be internal.
I'd prefer if sizeof(x) was used throughout, instead of sizeof(op_t). As a bonus, op_t would only occur once (in the variable declaration) and then the typedef could easily be removed.
I'd probably make this _parseMemInfo. If we see that we need it outside this module we can always drop the leading underscore.
I'd rather do the logging fix separately, and not in 2.9.2 To avoid the potential to miss any warnings, we can add a warning in the 2.9.2 release note to not run the upgrade in batch mode.
I'd say yes. I mean, why not have hex for your file sizes internally? :)
if a comment is behind the field it describes, doxygen needs "///<" (with a symbolized left arrow) to realize it correctly
If a user term isn't returned I believe you'll get NPEs when displaying lists of changes. That's why I wrote https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/35201 so that this error is discovered early and is properly reported. I was a while since I looked at it, and the code might've changed since then, so don't take my word for it.
If AddSdrObject() method, test goes into infinite loop. Because there is already AddSdrObject() function with same parameter which is mandatory in both cases. So should I add new method in parent class?
If all you are doing here is testing that the object returned by Network.get_by_id is passed to the allocated_fixed_ip() method properly along with some other arguments, the more clean and canonical way of doing that would be this: @mock.patch('nova.objects.Network.get_by_id', return_value=mock.sentinel.network) def test_add_fixed_ip_instance_using_id_without_vpn(self, get_by_id_mock): net_id = networks[0]['id'] with mock.patch.object(self.network, 'allocated_fixed_ip') as allocate_mock: self.network.add_fixed_ip_to_instance(self.context, FAKEUUID, HOST, net_id) get_id_mock.assert_called_once_with(self.context, net_id, project_only='allow_none') allocate_mock.assert_called_once_with(self.context, FAKEUUID, mock.sentinel.network, address=None)

If I understand this right the buildr process is able to load Java classes dynamically and invoke them with reflection? That does it make it slightly easier to do some complex steps.
if in some places function returns something then it should return always something
If it sounds funny, I should fix it. Your explanation is a good approximation of what's happening. We are limiting traffic... Any suggestion for how to improve? Hmm, I think I see what you mean. We are not changing the amount of traffic, just the proportion of that traffic which is "going" to the campaign. What about, "Throttle impressions"?
If it's not set, there's no way to get FSP failure data out. I agree that it's not an absolute requirement, but without it, if there's a failure, you're going to be pretty lost. We could move it from here and put this below, surrounding the #if statements and not actually fail, but my opinion was this was the best option...
If no version can be parsed "0.0.0" â€” "0.0.0" is the result
If non-empty, go into reverse mode where the buildlet dials the coordinator instead of listening for connections. The value is a comma-separated list of modes, e.g. ....
if so there will be some problems here - i mean, to authorise we need password/token - token is really not supported in that version of nova_client. dunno what password to use here - where we're using ctx from trust. Using service user creds here is not really a good idea.
if that's a uintptr_t, then you again don't need this double cast.
If the methods of this class are only called from the request handler (worker) thread, then I think locking is not necessary. A comment describing which member variables the mutex is protecting would be helpful. See the comment in the header file.
If the string is boxed (ie. if the string is created in javascript new String("...")), it is no longer acts like java.lang.String in GWT lang. For example (aBoxedJsString instanceof String) will return false.
If there is only one developer path, do not append '0' to the Xcode name. It looks weird.
If this is considered a development tool and not a production tool, it should have LOCAL_MODULE_TAGS := eng
If this is never called - then we need to remove the method, it's signature in the header, and all call-sites for it (right?).
If this line is removed the rDescription parameter name (and only the name) needs to be commented out because otherwise in an --enable-werror build the build breaks with "unused variable".
If this need to be public, can we have a short doc comment?
If this place is fixed to contain fd->flags, should the other places(anon fd) also be fixed to use fd->flags?
if this was copied from another IT (?) and the GAV was not changed, it will conflict with the other IT when 'mvn install' installs it into the local repo. It's a good idea to make all GAVs used in test projects specific to the IT that is being run to avoid unwanted crosstalk/side-effects between unrelated ITs, esp. when they are being run in parallel. (and I know some ITs we have are not good examples for this...) I.e. same comment applies to all pom.xmls used here for test projects.
If we agree to always treat a single number as JSON even if the client doesn't enable datatype support, then we can always set its datatype to JSON regardless of that.
If we converted helper code to Groovy, we would have the Elvis operator. And closures to handle the try+finally+close idiom. Just sayin' ;)
If we're trying to make this documentation more consistent with other module pages, then I assume this page is meant to be similar to http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtcore/qtcore-index.html in terms of listing the types provided by the module, so we should add a list here that link to the following types: * Component * QtObject * Binding * Connections * Timer as these are the types provided by the QtQml module.
if we've got this, do we still need the flag? this field should probably be called something more like "allocated_stack_size".
If you are currently on 0.10,+ you won't see the message. This only appears only when coming from 0.8 or earlier.
If you dig into the code, at some point you will reach a very strange statement (a couple of calls from setCacheSize), qMax(qMin(.....), 25). The size reported by that might differ from the size specified by the caller, in which case the caller should be informed of that. If you query cacheSize() you will get the value of the variable, not the value that was adjusted after the qMax(qMin...) calls.
If you instead put this into the gerrit-server directory, you can then refactor the AdminSetParent SSHD command to also use this implementation. That would reduce the amount of code needed to add this feature, since its mostly just extracting the existing code from AdminSetParent.
If you look at the previous version of the code we returned true if the new one didn't contain "engine" I just noticed that I need to nuke out the engine params from setting :D
if you put editable, no need for editableOnTemplate, its good for both
if your job is parse the service_profile to then pass it to the driver, just let the driver take care of this directly. Less cross-talk and better separation.
If your users often link their books or publications to one online catalogue, then you can set the URL prefix here, and they will only have to paste the book or publication ID at the end of the URL. You must make sure that your URL ends with a "/". For example: If your users need to link to publications in WorldCat frequently, set the URL prefix to <pre>http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/</pre>, the the users only need to enter the publication ID at the end of the URL.
I'll add a comment. I don't think #ifdef is a good idea. It makes bugs more likely because you have more code and that code is less tested (because only one version is only compiled and run on any one system). But I will include the non-workaround version in the comment.
I'll let peter decide what he wants to email; but changed the subject to include the host name.
I'll remove it here, but so you know - there's a problem - if someone sets it to null (for example from REST), it fails with NPE in StorageComandBase. but that can be fixed in a different patch.
i'm confused why this changes the string you fputs but not the 'fn'?
I'm not clear if "${workspace_loc:gitiles-parent}" mean "$WORKSPACE/gitiles-parent" or if it means "Path to the project named "gitiles-parent". When I changed the on-disk location (via the rename above) of my gitiles checkout (under my /src/workspaces directory) to /src/workspaces/gitiles-parent then I got to the next error. :)
I'm not entirely sure this will work - I'll have to give this a test.
I'm not really liking this name, maybe just 'Resources'?
I'm not sure I understand your point here. Do you mean I should talk about things like field alignment and so on? I think that mentioning Java would make this more confusing.
I'm not sure if I understand why it should not pick ":/extras/custom3/test" as first.
I'm not sure we would ever remove this. When running the Super Dev Mode from a static html page instead of a server, people link directly to .nocache.js, so it should always exist.
I'm removing those checks in the other modules too. This is the new way.
I'm sorry :D Order these
I'm still trying to understand what this new logic brings to the table...after all of this effort, we are still just enforcing that the project/tenant-id that created an entity (secret/order) is the same one that can perform operations on that entity. However, the database relationships used in the entity queries enforce this, so what does all of this do that is different? If we were doing attribute-level access control, it might make more sense to me, but entity level for tenant-id RBAC is redundant to the db queries to me.
i'm very concerned that this is done at non-obvious place. it will be hard to observe that RPCs are found "replied" late in our context. we don't have any tests for this. if something is changed, then when we'll notice?
IMHO the probe*XML functions should simply take xmlTextReaderPtr. shared_ptr is only used to manage the lifetime of the reader, so it is impl. detail. I would even remove the typedef.
IMHO this two functions are unnecessary. There are only validates (oh my...) Better if will be done in the level using the parameters.
IMHO, we should explicitely add coverage for the method you're adding so we could isolate any problem later on
In code this will read "mgr.Mgr". If move to svc package, it would read "svc.Mgr". Also, Let's just name in Manager so: "svc.Manager".
In my company, this is a rule to put the constant before a variable for comparison. This rule avoid also to forget a '=' in '==' operator and to create a bug. You can retrieve this rule in ESF project(TIPS-38, https://polarsys.org/wiki/ESF_coding_rules). We think that the same work could be interesting with Papyrus.
In my opinion a distinction needs to be drawn between IPv6 header bogus length and extension header bogus length. Whether all the different extension header should use the same expert_field or not for length is another issue, it's debatable but my current opinion is that they should be separate, i.e, ei_ipv6_routing_invalid_length, ei_ipv6_dstopts_invalid_length, etc. but if someone thinks differently please share.
In my opinion this function is not required. ArrayIndexItems function can return one more array called counts (count for each entry). NewSecondaryIndexEntry() method can be added with one more arg count. During index inser, you just need to iterate through itms, counts := ArrayIndexItems() and encode as NewSecondaryIndexEntry(itm,count)
In the follow-up change [1] this method is renamed to 'canEditChangeLabels' [2]. I would propose to name it already here 'canEditChangeLabels' so that it doesn't need to be renamed in the next change. [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/24661 [2] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/24661/4/gerrit-server/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/server/project/ChangeControl.java
In the latest patch, you switched from glib memory to wmem memory. So you do not want to call g_free but you still want to destroy the hash table itself, otherwise you are leaking memory. So switch to g_hash_table_new instead of g_hash_table_new_full and put back the call to g_hash_table_destroy.
In this case, we only need to set it (item->old_offset) to zero, because _wal_flush_cmp() function compares 'item->offset' instead when 'it->old_offset' is zero. Thanks.
In which case, shouldn't the code just say that all other open projects should already have their SDK's pointing to the SDK used by the IDE? i.e., now that we do this, we shouldn't have to modify other projects, only this project since all others should already be in sync. The fishy part here is just that choosing something in a project import dialog affects other projects which doesn't make sense. If you want that experience, then the dialog should be more of a global IDE preference.
increment out is extra here, you can use num_rebalance everywhere
indeed! Sorry, I assumed that this function was tested and it seems trivial to me since in Oracle/Sybase this works like a charm would you mind sending a patch fixing the fn_db_delete_config_values as well and put me as a reviewer ? thanks
Indeed, annoying even more as -i in POSTROUTING is already used in external_gateway_nat_rules (L1468)
Indeed, thanks. I discovered this myself early last week, and addressed it in I82ff6602af3bf5 so that we use gcc 4.9.3 on slaves where that matters. Love these commercial-grade compilers!
indent is not right: Use space and not TAB
indent. But how about defining skipontest() { if [ -z "${TESTING_ENV}" ] ; then "$@" else: echo skipping "$@" } It should be added to ovirt_store_config (in case the test happens to be run on ovirt-node).
inefficient. instead of using contains() above and section() here, one can use indexOf() above and mid() here.
Instead of having "%s" of "%s" I'm thinking it should be "%s" belonging to "%s" I feel that both "Page 1 belonging to Group 1" and "Page A belonging to Robert Lyon" make more sense than "Page 1 of Group 1" and "Page A of Robert Lyon"
Instead of malloc() maybe you can use stack: gchar tmpname[41]; 41 is enough? Cannot be greater?
Instead of putting everything in the collector and then looping through later when outputFormat==JSON why not switch here on outputFormat and thus allow results to be printed immediately for JSON and collected only for JSON_SINGLE?
instead of this simply add "creation_date_time=creation_date_time" to __init__ method bellow
int or long (underlying ssize_t types) should be OK to return this?
Intentionally made this INFO, as restore being a not so common operation this log wouldn't be quite frequent, and also it's good to know why and who stopped bricks in these cases for debugging later, coz most customer setups don't run in debug mode
ip6_addr.bytes is no more initialized with this change.
Is it confirmed with UI team to use this distinction?
is it margin, or padding? see e.g. http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp
Is it possible to put this init function inside the nehalem romstage ? Or are there any problems
Is omitting other kinds of completion proposals on a specific purpose, or just a way to keep the patch small (and you currently don't need more)? This kinda contradicts the use of the general type Binding (rather than MethodBinding) - looks like you couldn't make up your mind ....
Is sqlite the only DB option to use Ganesha? What about mysql? sqlite is usually not used in production. I'm just wondering why there's such limitation here.
Is the model about logs (as the class name suggests) or about log rows (as the parameter name suggests)? At least one of them needs to be changed.
Is there a function for this query already? or should we make one for future? It is just that this is quite a big block of code, and would be more readable factored out
Is there a reason we are not doing stuff like the below, which seems to me would better across a wider range of machines: // lockFocusFlipped not available before OSX 10.6 if ([pimage respondsToSelector:@selector(lockFocusFlipped:)]) { [pImage lockFocusFlipped:YES]; } else { [pImage setFlipped: YES]; [pImage lockFocus]; }
Is there a selector you can use with $.closest so this doesn't look so godawfully clumsy?
Is there a way to edit the commenteditabletime? I haven't spotted one.
Is there any practical reason to skip class literals in JsInterface chains other than code size? Please add an explanation here.
is there some missing code here that should go along with these Name objects? Persimmon has some methods that go along with these. Might be worth looking in to.
is this an optional call or clients should always call it at the end? when is it a good idea to call unmount? Can we add this info to some form of documentation?
is this equivalent to: lmm->lmm_pattern &= ~cpu_to_le32(LOV_PATTERN_F_HOLE)
Is this just a bad formatting here (or is clang-format to blame)? I would prefer to put the name and type on a single line in that case. Separating the * seems wrong in a lot of ways.
Is this marked 'latest' in the other place it's defined?
Is this necessary though? Would anything bad happen if we encode to utf-8? Also, it looks like this exists to make sure that we aren't using utf-16 or something else, in which case we would definitely want to keep this even in python3.
Is this only relevant for new Js interop or was it also a bug with regular JSOs? If it was a bug with JSOs, we should add the relevant regression test.
Is this the right API? An alternative is: func If(s RuneSet, tTrue, tFalse Transformer) Transformer type RuneSet interface { Contains(rune) bool } and have unicode.RangeTable implement this interface. If performance is a concern, the If function could do a type assertion to see if s is a *unicode.RangeTable, and switch to an optimized implementation, the same way that the image/draw package does in the stdlib. But I'm not sure if we even want a Ranges or If. The point of the Transformer interface is to transform things in bulk. If you're going to be chopping between two separate transformers depending on the input runes, then it seems like you're not getting the benefit of transforming in bulk. Instead, I'd just loop over the input and append to a []byte. It's not like you have some input that contains both Code Page 437 and Shift-JIS and you want to switch between them. Your phone number Ranges example seems a bit contrived, and again, I'd just for/range over the string for that particular task. As for title-casing latin but not greek, is that something that people really want to do?? I wonder what Rob thinks. Can you start a separate e-mail thread just for API design?
Is this the same thing as CRAMTMP? can we use that to make it more obvious it's a tmp directory?
isn't the client always linux? hmmm... client is a terrible name. i've no idea what i'm looking at here. i was planning on moving those files that currently have "client" in the name. there it seems to mean "device". usb_linux_client is the device-side code, usb_linux is the host-side code. likewise adb_auth. adb_client.cpp doesn't fit this pattern though --- it's a mixture? and for file_sync, client is the *host* and 'service' is the device.
Isn't the Config callback sufficient? It sounds tricky that a returned Config is valid only until the Config callback is called. If possible I prefer limiting the Config's life inside the Config callback and letting users maintain a copy of some info based on need.
Isn't this a dict_get failed rather than a dict_set?
It adds more things to go wrong than just downloading everything again to do a reinstall. I understand the desire, downloads are a pain, but downloading again is a much more predictable zero state than some set of possibly-correct archives on local disk checked against some possibly-correct set of hashes. All of which is a lot of extra moving parts to work around a problem (slow connections). Is it worth it? Maybe. But it is a lot more to go wrong.
It appears the requisite form is "elseif," so I left this one as-is. "...TYPO3 code must not use the else if construct."(http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/CodingGuidelinesReference/PhpFileFormatting/PhpSyntaxFormatting/Index.html)
It better to have a log here rather than having GF_VALIDATE_OR_GOTO. The log can be gf_msg (this->name, GF_LOG_ERROR, 0, Q_QUOTA_INODE_MISSING, "Missing inode, can't adjust for quota"); Just add a enum with appropriate number associated to it, there is no diagnosis for this.
It does not appear that you need this treeColorSet.
it doesn't leave them; it always removes them. "use specified directory for temporary files"
It feels wrong to be doing this sort of checking in this class, it is huge already. I suspect that passing in the appropriate merge strategy via the factory would be cleaner.
It fills the functionname <-> opcode mapping from a list of text resources in RID_STRLIST_FUNCTION_NAMES in formula/source/core/resource/core_resource.src
It is a core class, why should it be independent from core usage? "If you just assign an end date you have to jump in the source code to become an idea how the start date is resolved." This can be written into the function comment, so if we may change $GLOBALS['EXEC_TIME'] we do not need to change so much calls.
It is a logical change, but it is correct! $configuration['vendorName'] !== NULL triggers a PHP notice, when $configuration['vendorName'] is not set
It is a matter not related with this commit, but shouldn't be an optimization if we replace '\n" with ";" instead of "\\n" so as we save some bytes in final JS? We should consider edge cases like ',\n' in js objects, etc, though
It is my update of this help page: https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/XML_File_Formats It should also link to Expert Config page, but it does not exist yet.
It is possible to kept alcatel-lucent.xylan (and remove the other) Xylan has buy by Alcatel in 1999... (if i remember..)
It is pretty inconsitent. Some have very short descriptions (like this one) others only point to the jdk doc (which is what I will do). Big TODO update all url pointers.
It is the same argument, that we want positive constants for time constants.
It isn't :( https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/119847/
it looks like createMergeConflictInfo() always shows the warning, then adding the warning should be an implementation detail of createMergeConflictInfor() and the mergeResult needs to be passed to it as a parameter
It looks like this allows a user who cannot see all branches to probe which branches exist. By looking at the error message "it doesn't exist" vs. "user does not have rights to delete it." a user can detect if a branch that is not visible to him exists.
It makes sense that this is for the IOMMU since family 15 model xxx are the only parts that support it.
It probably is, but what happens when somebody upgrades the libvirt? Do we require vdsm restart as well? Or will it suddenly start working?
It seems clearer to return Future<?> here and let the caller set the variable. A better name would be something like startAddingEntryToCache since the postcondition is that when it returns, the task is scheduled. (Assuming the persistent unit cache is running at all.)
It seems like calling Window.Location.replace() would reload the page? If it doesn't in this case, is that portable?
It seems that you changed the behavior when there is an overflow. The data of ConstantManager are not longer corrected, thus, it is not possible trying to merge a smaller dex file which does not overflow. Could you upload a separate CL that remove only this feature with figures to see if there is benefits. ? Perhaps, you had some problems with it for parallel dex merging or you think that it was not useful ?
It seems to me that the above helpers would be better suited in a different file to keep this file a purely generator one. Does that make sense? is there any good reason to keep it here?
it seems to me that this operation is not optimal as it would try to find a number in a list, while you only need to check it against 0, 4095 boundaries.
It seems to me that we have a more serious issue here.
It seems to me to be the case. There is a bug: https://b.corp.google.com/issues/17586779 shertz probably knows more about it.
it should be if( this->m_UsePhysicalSpace && !this->m_PhysicalSpacesMatch )
It was intended to be Modes from the start, but could not be fixed before without braking BC. Should probably go as a separate commit.
It was only referenced from the description text in rest-api-accounts.txt which is deleted by this change. Since the JSON entities of the REST endpoints are described directly in the REST API documentation I've moved the description of the QueryLimit over to rest-api-accounts.txt.
it will be used by the UI from a query: when suggesting auto-completion of all existing labels
It will change the style of link that gitweb creates when it outputs HTML to the client. If a site wants the non path-info style, leaving this enabled would defeat that setting.
It works pretty well and provides status information for impatient users. Note that nrms is a shared variable among the threads and that the line is overprint with the carriage return character in a fifo manner.
It would be helpful if the returned structure were described more fully, just for clarity.
it would be nice to use a DTO for the options. this would make it possible to extend it later (which I am pretty sure we will do) without breaking extensions using the interface
It would be useful to add a short comment here with the kernel version in which this API changed, so that it is easier to clean up later.
It would be would to expand into '... main stats view in rt server' or similar.
It would help to have a DHT_MSG_DISK_LAYOUT_MISSING msgid here
It would require to change diskImageGuid member to static as well.
It'd be nice to coalesce such case lists into a single line, up to some line length.
ITK 4.7 is out :-) This required could be still added in the version specification to the find_package call for this example, though.
itkGetInputMacro and itkSetInputMacro are ITK wrappers for this->ProcessObject::GetInput(#name) and this->ProcessObject::SetInput(#name) I'm not sure what you think is wrong here, please elaborate.
It's a format with the ovirt engine format template, will recover the format.
It's a nice feature; does it cause a particular problem?
It's an excellent day when there's more documentation than the core developers can remember having!
It's either useless or not. If it's useless, remove. (Note that we do not like transitive includes, though.)
It's feeling funky and not particularly DRY in here. Do you think we should have a more consolidated response handler, then have these functions simply access already processed data?
It's in the debug code below, but I'd add a comment here saying something like // n = (p - base) / s.elemsize, using division by modular multiplication
it's just not correct to skip ./.. in OSP because it doesn't know whether this is a stripe or just regular directory which we can access via OSP.
It's left intentionally like that, so that a patch that actually enables one LFP looks cleaner.
It's not clear to me what this really does. Given: Dir("a", "b", "c") Does this create c as a file or an empty directory? The name 'Dir' suggests the latter, but the comment seems to suggest the former.
It's now streaming the progress to the client. Done
It's one less file to update for anyone adding an extcap executable. I was hoping to migrate the Windows buildbots to CMake this week, which would make this less critical.
Its probably better to include this line in a {} block to avoid inadvertent errors while making any changes around this code block as well as to make the code clearer to understand.
It's still an executable file. As opposed to, say, a Linux application that you build on Windows and which has a file with an extension .msi - that would most likely not be an executable.
I've double checked the (REST) command i used to delete emails. It wasn't a typo because I used the exact same command with an admin user and it worked just fine. It was only when I used the user with canModifyAccount permission that it didn't work. Could the 'not found' message be from the Email.parse() in Email.java requiring Administrator permission?
I've shortened to isIPv4, but I don't think preferIPv4 is correct. first(preferIPv4) seems reasonable, but partition(preferIPv4) doesn't actually prefer IPv4.
I've uploaded an alternative in patch set 5, which you might dislike less :-)
Ja, if there were a clean way to have the old name mean a new -q version that'd be fine, but I think this is the best we can do.
Josh, my proposal is to see boot as a helper for deploy driver (or to any other interface or anyone else) rather than to see it as a separate interface. Boot should just take care of getting the bare metal booted to the required environment - whether for ironic to perform an operation OR to boot the user-requested image. Thinking in these lines, I would think boot interface should refrain from participating in cleaning. Boot interface should participate in cleaning only if it had something to clean up on the bare metal node that would take a lot of time - in my mind there isn't anything. We can discuss in the IRC.
Just a pre-emptive note, I put these TODO's in the code, because they are separate refactoring issues, which would be better handled in a separate bug.
Just a question: Does ant use ; as a path separator on all platforms, or should you use File.pathSeparator (which will be : on Windows) ?
Just a quick question, if we are not creating the volfile, what's the outcome?
Just a suggestion: May be we can pass both channels as arguments ?
Just cleaning, this regex remove empty string concatenation: + ("") This can happen when we start a new group of concatenation (see appendConcatOperation()) and there is nothing to print afterwards. In this case the string ends with a concatenation of an empty string
Just curious, how come you use a RandomAccessFile here? It might be simpler to just Guava (which lint already depends on): String firstLine = Files.readFirstLine(file, Charsets.US_ASCII); (that's com.google.common.io.Files)
Just delete this line, have one empty line in between the background and the scenario.
Just put "Sync groups in these contexts only" as field text. And put the rest in a note beneath the text field: "Note: Leaving this field blank, the user authentication contexts will be used." Help needed to let admins know how they need to enter the context.
Just use 10px. I also rebased on latest master and adjusted look and feel of buttons here to match the changes made in context of [1]. [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/62460.
Just wondering if _nl_addr_cache and _nl_link cache can be factored somehow with a common helper.
k. Just thought because I removed not supported stuff, tested it and improve code quality qulifies me. I'll remove it.
leave it defined here, just declare it extern in the header, otherwise each file that includes packet-usb.h will get its own copy
Let's avoid having commented out code. Delete the DCHECK (which looks wrong to me anyway - you certainly could have a const index, but backends are under no obligation to take advantage of that information.
LG_MSG_INSERT_FAILED => LG_MSG_RBTHASH_INSERT_FAILED
limit the results as well as -> the "wel" needs to get a second "l" ;-)
line length. You can also use qPrintable(m_keyPressBuffer) here.
Line lengths, seems like most of these would be easier to read if they were placed on the preceding line before the variables.
line wrap before throws so the line isn't over 80 columns
Logging on allocation failures is discouraged. So remove this.
Long line. Either break into multiple lines or add a static import.
Looking at all *Listener.java files in our source tree I see the following two cases: * a listener is just notified that an event happened but cannot do anything to prevent/block that event. In that case the listener doesn't throw any checked exception(s). Examples: GitReferenceUpdatedListener, HeadUpdatedListener, AuditListener, ... * a listener can block the event. In this case the listener throws a checked exception which is on the same level of abstraction as the listener interface. Examples: CommitValidationListener throws CommitValidationException, MergeValidationListener throws MergeValidationException, ... Since this listener is not intended to validate/block a group membership change(s) it belongs to the first category and shouldn't throw any exception.
Looks like here it's too late to set the response status. When I'm reaching this code I'm getting: WARN org.eclipse.jetty.server.HttpChannel : /oauth?code=7eefeb8697212b7c62c2&state=wjm3XI24hnUc7A2fbZ0JaLOjmVkrEQxOMidLRy50Zfg%2C%2Flogin java.lang.IllegalStateException: Committed at org.eclipse.jetty.server.Response.resetBuffer(Response.java:1253) at org.eclipse.jetty.server.Response.sendError(Response.java:567) at org.eclipse.jetty.server.Response.sendError(Response.java:544) at com.google.gerrit.httpd.auth.github.GitHubLogin.login(GitHubLogin.java:68) at com.google.gerrit.httpd.auth.github.OAuthWebFilter.doFilter(OAuthWebFilter.java:78) at com.google.gerrit.httpd.RunAsFilter.doFilter(RunAsFilter.java:117) at com.google.gerrit.httpd.AllRequestFilter$FilterProxy$1.doFilter(AllRequestFilter.java:64) at com.google.gerrit.httpd.AllRequestFilter$FilterProxy.doFilter(AllRequestFilter.java:57) at com.google.gerrit.httpd.RequestContextFilter.doFilter(RequestContextFilter.java:75)
Looks like the null should be dropped. Previously it was null for the attributes, then Evonne added {'class': 'title'}
Looks like the order of the parameters are reversed. It should be expected, actual. self.assertEqual('available', volume['status'])
m->total_size is untrusted input, whereas c and microcode end are trusted. There's no risk of overflow.
machine_emergency_restart is a good place for the cache flush in the sense that it is already machine-specific. But yes it's fine to take this approach. LGTM
magnus, to write something along the lines of this is the number of sets of the most frequently written output type per frame set. the best default will need some experimentation. ideally this would be a user-configurable option, but it is not clear whether a (hidden) command-line option would be best (or env var), and not clear whether anybody would really use it in practice. Disk is cheaper than user and/or compression time, for the most part. So we'll add a TODO to reconsider for 5.1(?) and not before.
Make sure the smbus code is compiled and linked in.
Make these transient and lets just handle the serialization entirely ourselves. That way we don't have to actually hold onto buf when we have the object form already on hand.
Make this something like 'You have no posts tagged %s'; and put in the changed in the tpl file
May be you could add a comment where these constants are coming from?
Maybe "findSubClasses" would be a better name for these methods?
Maybe include a warning if the assumption is not met?
Maybe move this to getStringMethod and rename getStringMethod to getStringMethodOverload?
Maybe name this installToDispatcher() or something like that? I had a hard time understanding all the different classes.
Maybe pick a different name to avoid a collision with the field of the same name in Main?
Maybe some info about the purpose (selecting node position?)
Maybe TestChanges? *I prefer FooBar over BarForFoo *"Util" is redundant with the package name *TestFoo says "implementation (e.g. fake) of Foo for tests" while TestFoos says "static methods for dealing with Foos" It's not super compelling, but hey, at least it's shorter.
Maybe this comment: // The old CSS resource has no support for many at-rules, like animations. There is no way for us to parse them using the old CSS parser, so we will just output them as a string to the GSS stylesheet and hope that the GSS parser is okay with the rule
Maybe this could be outputWriter instead of writer2.
maybe this runnable needs to run after the previous one's onSuccess?
maybe update this comment to give an example of the unparseable credentials.
Maybe you could add a real description - yes it's just something really minor :)
mdrun -nstlist > 0 is not affected by this change, it will still change nstlist. Or do you mean to add a note even with nstlist=0? nstlist=0 is explained as guess and 1 with 1 seems ok to me.
Me neither, i am just writing functional tests for this ... gimme a sec.
Method descriptions in VTK must always start with this: // Description: If this line is missing, then the automatic document generation will not work.
mh yeah will be removed with next push...
might as well drop the conditional and just assign it
Might be better to move this test to right after the docio_read_doc_key_meta call, since it's doing the error handling for it. If there was an error, there's no point in populating 'doc' and '*doc_offset', right?
Mind putting text documenting what's happening here? We shuould start documenting non-obvious stuff
Minor and optional cleanup: I think we can drop support for mw:WikiLink/* at this point both here and in magLinkRe.
Minor code style thing: please remove the extraneous parentheses around (empty($USER->accountprefs) && empty($i->theme)).
missing a comma here, can you help adding it back? ;)
mmm there are two __init__ functions here. Please check and re-upload the patch for review..

More or less the same steps as described in the comment Sep 13 11:50 AM change: https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/46171/16/gerrit-pgm/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/pgm/init/InitModule.java Can you try it with non existing H2 Database: <Resource name="jdbc/ReviewDb" type="javax.sql.DataSource" username="" driverClassName="org.h2.Driver" password="" url="jdbc:h2:file:/home/davido/projects/test_site_auto/db/ReviewDB" maxActive="100" maxIdle="20"/>
Most of the spring stuff looks like it can be found in the default m2 repo. Why do we need this? Also, milestone is wrong here.
Move up with other "just set reserved = 7" case statements?
Moving this logic to ProcjectControl will also require additional modifications in ReceiveCommits. My approach fixes both issues in one place. Also this approach protect us from making same error in future. Personally I wouldn't move this logic to upper level. Signature of this method can be changed to canCreate(Map<Stirng, Ref>, RevWalk, RevObject) instead of using Repository. But IMO will keep this logic here to prevent from this issue in future.
mw-mf-overlay-header seems like a rather meaningless class name. I wonder if we should move away from it to something more meaningful?
My bad, I did add one but then removed it again and forgot to change that line back
My change provides two options for clobber. So, the client can pass its own new rev id to couchdb or ask couchdb to generate a new rev id. This code path corresponds to the second case. So, the flag and expiration values here will be overwritten by couchdb, and you won't get them through your changes in mc_tap.
My idea was just to drop the parent class and move the methods down to the only inheriting class. But I can modify the __str__ in one shot.
My Nit Pref: eliminate if, just return the boolean evaluation.
My only worry here is that future c or assembly versions of memcmp16 might use x14, x15. I have used a more conservative approach in my tree: 1852 .Ldo_memcmp16: 1853 /* save lr, and return value if comparison equal */ 1854 stp x0, x30, [sp, #-16]! 1855 1856 /* set-up args for __memcmp16 */ 1857 mov x0, x2 1858 uxtw x2, w3 1859 1860 bl __memcmp16 1861 1862 /* restore lr, and return value if comparison equal */ 1863 ldp x1, x30, [sp], #16 1864 1865 /* if the strings are equal (i.e. x0 == 0) then return length comparison */ 1866 cmp x0, #0 1867 csel x0, x1, x0, eq 1868 1869 ret 1870 END art_quick_string_compareto
My point is that div_fsys1 is probably a fixed size as defined by the data sheet, and an unsigned int is not. So if it's a 32 bit value, as suggested by the fact that you're reading it with readl below, you should use uint32_t to ensure it's the right size. That struct might need to be fixed up too.
My point is that let's maintain our own configs even fi they are the same as the default ones, and change them soon by considering various factors including perf results.
My theory of this test: count goes to zero because the delegates go far enough out of bounds to be destroyed. But because of the easing formula, you have to flick harder to make them go that far out of bounds now.
Namespacing is weird here too... "imageId" is a Property but "provider" is a top-level attribute of a resource. It's also being used here with a different meaning to what has been understood to date (see above).
need to check for values <0 and use 1 (second) in that case.
need to guard this with a static bool so it's only executed once, assuming the above "her_dissector_delete()" is removed.
need to unify the translation of â€œDetails", to me "è¯¦ç»†è®¯æ�¯â€œ sounds better.
Need to use: with self.assertRaises(ex.NotSingleNameNodeException): validator.validate(cluster)
need to assumeTrue(cygProfile.exists()); when the trace is not present
needs to be space around the => eg $postid => $post
never mind. found it in "notification_internal_activity" :) will see what I can do
New messages don't have description in MessagesQqq.php or maintenance/language/messages.inc
Next few paragraphs look more like they should be code comments than change description. If there isn't a good place to put them in the code, maybe we should start an engine-internals.qdoc file (which is one big /*! \internal */ block)
next time, describe to which repository they're going.
nit: this import is not needed anymore and can be removed
nit: this sentence has six commas and two separate alternations ('or's). Maybe it could be split up?
Nit: While assimulating is a word that seem to exist, my only association was that it was a misspelling of assimilate. This leads me to believe that it's a word that non-native English readers might have trouble interpreting the right nuance of. This is the commit message however, so in this case it isn't the end of the world, not many will read it compared to the actual guide. :)
nit: wording. the sentence doesn't make sense. perhaps: Support creating a request for authentication of a remote...
nitpick: "$reset = $cfglang = $CFG->lang = null;" would have been even clearer here
nitpick: add a space between "if" and its opening pare
nitpick: if you move this line below, then you don't have to comment out the line below...
Nitpick: The pointer is only set in the ctor, so it should be const. Similarly in KEY2StyleContext.
no ? And would it actually be "Process nested group objects"? Help needed
no chance vds is null? lets say vds moved to error, then user remove it from system, will this timer still trigger?
No globals please if at all possible. But more generally, this is a base class - please stick specific functionality into derived classes. You already did that in SlideFragmentHandler for parts of it - for PPT_TOKEN( text ), when it comes in the SlideFragmentHandler context, just generate a new child context - e.g. like new SlideTimingContext( *this, mpSlidePersistPtr->getTimeNodeList() ) in that file. With that, you will get rid of that global state anyway.
no hsc in exceptions please. the exception handler does take care of proper encoding
No it doesn't "explode", I am not changing a sebool, I am changing the file context. Yes a restorecon would un-do the change. We'll need to file a request for that but for now this is good enough.
No it doesn't. We just have to parse repo-hooks childNodes after the project childNodes. Which you already do above. :-)
No it's not - leaving the dob blank means you just choose not to fill it in as the field itself is not compulsory.
No need for indentation on the last line, or even the preceding newline for that matter.
No need for indirection here. Merge benchmarkTCPConcurrentReadWrite into this function, and use the addr "127.0.0.1:0" directly.
No need for Provider here, inject FlushCashe directly. Both PostCaches & FlushCache are singletons. So the Provider hurts more than it helps here. E. g. on line 105 it get called in a loop and returns allways the same singleton instance.
No need for the above... The commit log & diff & etc provides info about the change.
no need for this change this, you are not using the "e"
no need to be redundant "described in the report". but this is bogus anyway - commit message are expected to be self-contained, and the bug links are merely "for more info, see ..." style.
No need to check for NULL because g_strdup will do this. And if value == NULL then tv->value will be uninitialised.
No!! More sleeps!! I think we're up to 22 seconds now!
No, /index.php/Foo is an Apache-mod_php-ism, not a guaranteed feature. Standard PHP anywhere else does not include that handling. You're going to have to explain how you expect 'redirected from' from a HTTP redirect would be handled. Because so far everyone who's attempted to turn redirect pages into HTTP redirects while preserving 'redirected from' properly has failed.
No, because this file and this macro is also used from plain C code, which only accepts this form of casting. Adding #ifdefs just for this purpose does not seem useful.
No, but its impact is pretty minimal so I wouldn't worry about it.
no, I'd like to keep the API of this class close to ObjectId
No, this is here by purpose to document that this is a static method, as that is not otherwise evident without looking at the header.
No, this is not sufficient. You also need to call checkXvgFile() using this second data instance. And please create a separate scope for this, so that the previous TestReferenceData object is destructed before this one is created; otherwise, it's difficult to reason that things work as expected , since there is (a bit unfortunately) a lot of logic in the destructor.
No. Note that what I write is not real and reciprocal space. Below the cut-off we have both the real space and reciprocal space contribution.
No. The exception is needed so it is rethrown if the user decides to cancel. User can only see exception stack trace in the log.
Non-standard ports (And other more exotic configs) now have their own section that I've added in this commit
Nope, forgot to cherry-pick that one. Thanks for noticing, fixed.
not a big thing but sequence number should have been bumped
Not a fan of createpopupmenu, it's huge and hard to read. reset columns I will do. I can be convinced of using cpm too.
Not all build tools use -j. Thus the simpler approach of directly setting build_cmd="make -j2"/"jom -j4" might be better.
Not currently. It's somewhat different from what the current reference data approach uses, as I guess that you would want to generate that state using some code that is not part of the test (since if you can generate the state with code that runs anywhere, you do not really benefit from serialization). Generic serialization is also a significant amount of code, even if straightforward (and with C++, it requires some careful thinking on what kind of constraints it enforces on the serializable types, unless you make the object itself responsible for the serialization).
Not having doxygen documentation for the defines will generate warnings when merged to master.
not if you want to compare from a raw byte array used to serialize object IDs
Not needed (in this case) since a 'set' is being done immediately following
Not really a fan of making it an error, as it is perfectly legitimate policy. Maybe a warning.
Not related, but may be better to move to constructPorperty(String suffix) or something like that.
Not sure about this method. It seems to make sense to me the way Dan explained it but I'm not comfortable giving this change a +2 since I didn't write any of the original code and may not be aware of all of the issues.
not sure how important this is, but other lines seem to have a tab at the beginning of the line and the added lines uses spaces. :D
Not sure what our own script has to do with the annotation. The export pragma could all be moved into the imp file if you prefer that. This would leave us with only the keep for where we misusing the preprocessor as template language (pme.c). I think we should replace this anynow. Right now if one runs it on any of the c++ files, IWYU makes changes we don't want. See the issues in the commit message. But I don't see how that could be fixed by using a script to read the output. It seems it would be easier to patch IWYU than replicating the header-analysis in a post-processing script.
Not sure where these param are from args or kwargs? Suggest to doc them clearly: :param args: ... :param kwargs: A dict of keyword arguments to be passed to the method, which should contain: â€˜usernameâ€™, â€˜passwordâ€™, â€˜auth_urlâ€™, â€˜api_versionâ€™ parameters.
Not sure why all these if statements are necessary... see the definition for optional_str() on line 579
Not sure why this one is confusing. It returns the list of files, so it has to be immediate, and it returns the files in that directory, not ones in sub directories.
not sure why we need this since it's a read.
not worth including the regular version number too?
Note that the rtl:: prefix removal is planned to be done by a scripted change somewhen in the near future, so while this change is ok, it should be less work for both you and the review if you do not specifically aim for these changes.
Note that these can be usually written simpler as just "" instead of OUString().
Note that this means envp is empty, while you fill in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PATH, and TMPDIR in the gomobile code. I'm not sure how to get the environment or if it's even necessary. (All the Go environment functions in runtime assume that Go has already been somewhat initialized.)
Now that I'm really looking at the code, would not the right fix be to change toknext to be signed instead of unsigned (so that the for loop stops immediately), or to check that it is > 0? if tokens = NULL, then parser->toknext will always be set to 0. That said, your change is somehow equivalent so we could keep it as-is.
now the test doesn't install SG at all. it will fall on the first run if SG is already installed on vm.
Now we have a copy of fiemap and a pointer fiemap. Which one is the "right" one?
Oh I'm all for small tests ;) But here we need data in the queue to flush it, and data to be present to take() it. So they kind of need to be done in sequence.
Oh right the $ to global is a nicer idea. I have just removed jquery statement and did not add the global. That is just a few errors and they do need fixing.
oh, good catch! funny this slipped in ... btw: ArrayUtility from extbase should be reviewed and at first glance it seems most of it could be merged to core ArrayUtility.
OH, I forgot your that CL :-) However STLPORT_WHITELIST isn't defined yet at this point. In config.mk it loads envsetup.mk (which eventually loads the product makefiles) before it defines STLPORT_WHITELIST. On the other hand, we can remove libstlport from this file, and add it to specific device's makefile, such as device/asus/flo/device-common.mk. I'd really like to keep the device names out of the build project.
Oh, thanx! I actually did not know that it was possible ... like Code Review for team learning :-) Will fix in the next patch-set.
Oh, you want it really obvious what type the variable is :)
Ohhh. I have a white background, so I didn't catch the yellow highlight. Thanks!
OK will work on the object containing tolerances for both precisions, with the helper functions intended to be the main way to construct them.
ok, but then i suggest you turn that thing into a macro which you can document centrally (QT_SEGMENTED_STRING_LITERAL or so). also, a warning in the QStringLiteral doc would be in order if it's not there yet.
Ok, I found an abandoned change in Gerrit from KyÃ¶sti [2], where Stefan commented this. Â»On ich7 / i945 pmbase is already set in romstage... Please drop #if 0 code...Â« Guess that justifies a comment so it is clear when comparing `lpc.c` from different PCHs. [2] http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/302/8/src/southbridge/intel/i82801gx/lpc.c
Ok, I've changed the method name to 'validate'. Not sure though if it's worth the effort to change the already existing listeners.
OK, thanks. The approach here and in my patch work fine if the user controls everything they way they want. When auto-detecting everything, this patch is better on non-AVX hardware that happens to have RDTSCP. Otherwise, they effectively work the same. When compiling on a new build host for old compute nodes, this patch will sometimes require the user to make two active settings to make a functional mdrun. That might mean they go hunting for docs twice, unless they find the new install guide section. At least we don't fail mysteriously any more! When compiling on an old build host for new compute nodes, both patches will sometimes make an mdrun that could be better in up to two ways. We could add a nag message for the double negation of the new code in gmx_detect_hardware.c "You, too, could be using RDTSCP!". AFAIK the proposition that using RDTSCP is good in user space is just educated guesswork, though. I was slightly concerned about one of the latter cases (build host is old, user knows they have AVX on the compute nodes, so they know to set SIMD and don't know RDTSCP exists / is relevant), but if we add the new nag then this case is solved well enough. So I'm happy to adopt this solution. Thanks! Shall I abandon my patch, send reviewers here, and one of us work on Erik's feedback and/or the new nag? If we add the nag, commit message needs updating.
OK, will change it - there was a debate about whether we should also check for 'false', 'False' etc., which is why it was a list. I left it like that in case we changed our minds! Provided we don't, I'll just make it a simple equality check!
OK. I'll check if [1] still works with asiidoctor before pursuing it any further then. [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/49451/
OK. I agree there's a sense that the state of the machine is not const.
Okay, I understand what you're trying to do here. My concern is that we change the state from BACKFILL to IN_MEMORY even if there are backfill items in the queue or unAcked items in the ACK queue that we will implement soon. This will cause some confusions in debugging, showing stats in UI, etc. Let's add this to the to-do list and address it as a separate commit.
Omit the err at the end. Its the result of the last possible test making it probably meaningless and possibly misleading.

On HTTP /abandon and /restore accept no body. This results in null being passed to the apply() method, which handles it gracefully by creating an empty input. I think its common to call /abandon and /restore with no input. Your tests are certainly showing that. Perhaps we should overload abandon() and restore() methods to also have a no-arg form that passes null to apply the same way the HTTP interface does when the client doesn't supply a body.
On second sought: actually you don't need this file (endpoint) at all. We have already POST /changes that creates a change and what are you doing here is to delegate to its apply() method, after translating your own Input to ChangeInfo. The only reason to have this class is to get the UiAction for granted (Guice DynamicItem binding and discovery). But you could solve this in different way: just construct UiAction on you own in ProjectJson and add it to actions map manually. See an example how it's done in InlineEdit series: [1]. Now, on the client side, from your custom UiAction you can invoke the original REST endpoint: POST /changes. The only difference to current solution: you would need to pass project name too, obviously. This also raises the question do we want to have this button on project info screen at all? We could add it to main page (or may be just add a keyboard shortcut), in wich case we are not in project context any more and the dialog must be extended to provide project name (with suggestion oracle for project, like it already does for branches). I don't have strong preference for one of these solutions. So, you can let it as is for now and wait for opinion of other reveiwers.

Only the find_package call actually needs to be in the itk-module-init.cmake file to make the imported targets visible globally. Everything else should be able to go inside the module CMakeLists.txt file.
Only the PatchSet.Id is required here. So cd.change(db).currentPatchSetId() is a better approach.
Oops, I guess I forgot to type 'make' after fixing that. Anyway, I finished my commits review in the meantime too.
Optional nit: this could go on the same line as excludes
or ask the maintainer to commit the change on the author's behalf.
Or, if the check is needed, do you mind adding a comment about when this can be false?
Other parts rely on non-null values, perhaps this should be critical. Anyway, let's not expand preconditions beyond JRE for now and submit the patchset that I already +2'd.
Our convention here is to have URL like this: /node/controller/reloadCertificate
OUString::replaceAll does not modify the OUString but returns a new OUString instead. this means that when converting an existing String *Replace* call you need to assign the returned value to the original string. you should get a warning about an "unused result" here but strangely i'm not seeing a warning with gcc 4.7, no idea why... at least the Clang tinderbox caught the problem. fixed in commit 03a381eaa58d77cf26dfa8d916d1ecda865c1937
P.S. - now that this is an attribute of the campaign, not an action, we need to change the i18n string to "Archived"
packet-s7comm.c:2550:23: error: unused parameter 'data' [-Werror,-Wunused-parameter] void *data) (use _U_ to set unused parameter)
pass errno as the third param and remove the "errno=%d" component.
Passing a whole volfile path this way seems a bit fragile. Would it be possible to pass the flag and a *relative* path, so that the receiver constructs the final path instead of the sender?
Patch Set 1: Fails (1 inline comment) I just tried this change on tot gavd on my waluigi and it didn't detect headphone insertion. I went back to just tot, the change renaming udev_listen -> udev_sound, and it does work. I know the commands for alsa were not flushed out yet in the max98095 codec, is that the problem right now?
Patch Set 1: Fails @Aske, really nice UI changes and the image GUI has improved a lot. One thins thou when trying to hide and element on a page which not has been published. An exception is thrown, maybe something that should be handled inside the PHP code instead.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this (1 inline comment) LGTM after a small bug fix.
Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this Hi ananth, I agree with Markus that I'm in favor of not merging this. What xml parser ate you using that is not capable of empty, closing tags? Esp. if you set the HTML tendering mode to XHTML, the output is a subset of XML. If you need to have empty closing tags replaced by q dedicated closing tag for a special use case, you could ask on http://forum.typo3.org to figure out a solution for you. I'm confident that it's possible, however I would not change TYPO3's default behavior. Thanks for your understanding. Yours Steffen
Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this I agree with the first reviewer, turning the condition around will make it better readable. Besides that, great idea and solution!
Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this Seems like you commited some too much ;)
Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved LGTM; and yes please do upstream.
Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve (2 inline comments) LGTM with a couple of small optional suggestions. I agree that using more realistic sites to consume memory would be nice, but I think getting something up and running soon would be valuable as well.
Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve Looks fine though agree with Chris's comment that exported strings should be defined in a header file that can be shared.
Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve Would wonder about chattr during runtime, but yeah you're likely right (assuming this has been image tested too).
Patch Set 1: Alon, Regardless of discussion we have in the bug #996021 calling .disconnect() when sdk instance is no longer needed is a good change, i think it can confidently go in.
Patch Set 1: Sorry, the news be module is completely broken for me ... sql error, then namespace errors ... but the news be module with 4-7 suffers from the exact error my patch has fixed which would be reintroduced with this "fix". On top of that, there is no point to check for the object we just created, thus we either remove the check, then we are back to the state before my patch which creates a warning. Please tell me the exact error that happens, otherwise I can not reproduce the regression.
Patch Set 1: Thanks for your reviews. To be honest, it would be nice, if you could be a bit more friendly to - not first time in case of Thomas, but occasional - contributors. IMHO one or two -1 are enough for the beginning. Bjrn and Philipp, you're really helpful contributors, thanks for that. We were discussing the "patch for a patch rule" over the last days, which we enjoined on ourselves as core team members some time ago (and it works in at least most of the cases I think). Please don't treat this as harsh words, I just want to make you aware of the fact that motivating every new contributor is very important for us, and hopefully also for you as an essential part of the TYPO3 community. Thanks for your support! Steffen P.S: The reason, why Jenkins fails is probably, because of the parent commit is very old and the patch has to be rebased. Will try to get this done now (if network connection allows)
Patch Set 12: Code-Review+2 currently our enums reflect the super-set of the devices which are supported. yeah - we are not allow flexibility at this stage.
Patch Set 13: Fails well, looks much better, you fixed the alerts, but in iscsi, block master domain, i get attribute error on missing (dom): MainThread::WARNING::2011-12-08 18:32:40,319::hsm::2578::Storage.HSM::(prepareForShutdown) Failed to stop RepoStats thread Traceback (most recent call last): File "/usr/share/vdsm/storage/hsm.py", line 2576, in prepareForShutdown self.pools[spUUID].stopRepoStats(dom) AttributeError: 'setMaxHostID' object has no attribute 'stopRepoStats'
Patch Set 2: (2 inline comments) the split string constants make me sad, but i'm not sure upstream u-boot has signed onto that sanity yet like the linux kernel.
Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this This bug is a duplicate 841534 of and will be handled in http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/6593. After discussing, the correct behavior is to allow diskless templates, so this patch is no longer relevant. Please abandon it. Sorry for the hassle.
Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved I concur with jrbarnette@. It sounds like we can do a separate issue/CL for removing the pragma. To that end, I think a TODO() referring to that issue could be useful if added to this CL.
Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve (3 inline comments) reading the code it looks okay to me. just minor things (can be done upon commit imho)
Patch Set 2: Verified by team member; Looks good to me, approved I could not reproduce the errors - however the changes look straight-forward.
Patch Set 2: Greg, Thanks for the info. I agree with your assessment on caching as well.
Patch Set 2: Liron, so lets think: Reconstruct flow: Go throught all vds refresh and on case of some exception connect. Recovery flow: Go through all vds connect and after that refresh, no need for exception handling on case of exception at refresh. especially additional refresh. No need for additional method that u introduced. Where it is 99% percent common. You already introduced a method that at some flow should return only true and complicated a very simple code. "right now there is no need to copy the method in my opinion - 99%" - your change at connectAndRefreshAllUpHosts in order to solve bug at reconstruct flow caused to regression in recovery flow. I don't think that these means 99% common.
Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1 @Sebastian: Yeah we already discussed that, but since we don't have time to implement promises or similar for 1.0 it's still better than before. So for now we make sure to fetch the stuff early, but I agree we should add a TODO in there
Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this (2 inline comments) I don't see the need for this change. If you built with the ebuild unmodified, you'd get an image.bin which would be what you want. As far as I could tell looking at the new function, it's identical to the old one except that you're leaving out the original image.bin. The difference between image.bin and image.rw.bin is that cros_bundle_firmware is being passed the --force-rw option in one case and not in the other. What that does is it changes the way parts of the image are put together so that vboot doesn't allow the RO only optimization even if the RO firmware claims it supports it. The RO only optimization is where you run the whole firmware out of RO instead of jumping into an RW copy partway through. If you really don't want to enable that optimization, you can not pass that flag to vboot when running VbInit. Even if you do want to split things out like this, it would be better to take the existing depthcharge function and to selectively build the RO image based on a use flag. Independent of whether splitting things up is a good idea, if Mike (who knows bash much better than I do, I think) likes the style of the new function you've made, it would be nice to incorporate the style changes back into the original function.
Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2 Now it looks good, yeah it worked in the first patch set but the rebase missed the comma
Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this Please fix the indent pep8 errors in gluster_cli_tests.py at least.
Patch Set 4: Although already merged, I don't think this is the right solution. Currently the behavior of the permissions system (TCEmain and thus also all other components) is to use "checkLanguageAccess" only if the TCA for the table has a "languageField". "pages" is not such a table, because there is "pages_language_overlay". So the current integrators solution to restrict a user not to be able to edit the "Original Language" is to remove the permissions for editing table "pages" and only allow "pages_language_overlay". See also http://forge.typo3.org/issues/27794 This is not what is being done in the patch, but instead you simply check for checkLanguageAccess. Similar problem we have in the "List view", as the context menu provides more options (i.e. for content elements) than really permitted. Permission check in TCEmain is more "aggressive" than in the GUI. Correct solution for this particular fix would be to check if user has "edit permissions" on the "pages" table - just like TCEmain also does. As this is confusing for integrators in general, I would rather propose that someone thinks about a better approach on "language restriction permissions on pages" in the first place before fixing the GUI. I am undecided still if we should revert this merge, but I am currently pretty sure we should not backport that to 4.5. Maybe in your research you find out different aspects than I did or you can prove me wrong as I have only touched the "surface" of the whole complex. Please let me know!
Patch Set 4: The indexer usage was not changed, it just fixes the bug and it works. :) Adapting to the new indexer is yet another task, of course.
Patch Set 5: Fails This already failed the unit tests once. Please do not submit any CLs until the unit tests are fixed.
Patch Set 5: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve Rebased with current master Took comments into account. Using 4.3 in deprecation log as it is like that in config_default but using @deprecated with 4.6 and remove in 4.8 to stick to our rules.
Patch Set 5: > David - it used to be that you needed to land both the > stable and the 9999 cros workon ebuild at the same time. > Has that been fixed and you can just land the 9999? That's right, you only need to land the 9999 now. (Actually it's been supported since at least Oct 2010, but yeah there used to be a bug)
Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this I like it, but it fails: * A fatal is triggered if the _extensions table is empty (test: just truncate the table) * After update a refresh / reload should be done (or something), so the date is then current, or this should be handled by JS answer?
Patch Set 6: Except for my spaces nitpicking, yes ;-)
PatchTable$MyTable.onClick(ClickEvent) line: 299 will also call movePointerTo(cell.getRowIndex()); sorry I try every corner and cannot find the difference after adding this line.
Per our discussion, make this a class that's just the combobox? Maybe like AndroidApiCombo?
perform this check before fetching the translations above? in the else-branch you then set $allOptions to array(); Maybe initialise it to an empty array as the first line of this function (as in functions before) and only fetch translations when needed here
performTransaltion has different purpose. If scale is less than equal to 1 we will not perform transaltion. If the device doesn't support multi touch we need not go into this block and skip the execution of the next six lines, hence it was added here.
Perhaps I misunderstood Martins comment. But yes. I create a new change-id in ChangeUtil, so this is expected (and by design), but it has nothing to do with the footers. I do not change the change-id in the commit message - since that is not expected (git would never do it). I personally do not want the new change to have the same change-id (internally) as the old change. Is that something you really want?
Perhaps not so useful. If a user had a class that was no longer sent to other applications the Parcelable boiler plate code could be removed.
perhaps replace the whole thing with platform.linux_distribution() ?
personally, i prefer to have only with space after comma
planning to do that in a separate changelist for MB-14866: 1. merge lock with seqno_list into the same structure 2. maintain a vbMap instead of vbList in this service, so as to make vbno lookup/validation faster 3. do vbno validation in all relevant places in the service you mentioned that we could use list of list instead of map of list to avoid issues with map. Feel that it makes the code harder to read. we may have to understandard the behavior with maps anyway. Plan to make the changes above and see if the issue in MB-14866 re-cur.
Please add 2015 here: Copyright (c) 2007, 2015 IBM Corporation and others.
please add a comment explaining why leaving a try statement in the AST (with no catch blocks and no finally block) would leave the AST in an unsafe state
Please add constant for TEST_OTHER_DC_ID, it is confusing you're using the TEST_NETWORK_ID.
Please add more functional/features tests on this conf file when you add the rest of the code.
please add tests for fopen, we should test the different modes
Please add the comment to say that new_filename will be ignored in the auto compaction mode.
Please add the tab. Itâ€™s sad that the latest clean up patches for the Butterfly were not adapted.
please also mention that it builds the overriding/overridden method lists inside the JMethod instances
Please change it to ws_info_t *ws_info = NULL;
Please document these. is_precise is we know the exact type? Would 'exact' be clearer?
Please don't declare symbols weak. Provide weak definitions.
please don't do that keep the if (condition) stmt structure
Please don't do that. We manipulate DateTimeUtils.setCurrentMillisProvider to achieve what you want. Check ChangeEditIT for example: [1], Methods annotated with @Before and @After. * [1] https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/master/gerrit-acceptance-tests/src/ test/java/com/google/gerrit/acceptance/edit/ChangeEditIT.java#116
Please don't hijack other chipsets. i82801gx is ICH7, not NM10
Please don't. See my comment in utils.py. Configure the logger with proper formatter instead.
Please explain on why it is been taken out from the switch case below.
please explain what part of mdd_object_create() you need to reuse() (except mdo_create())
Please look at https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Checking_for_JGit_API_Changes_using_API_Baseline I suggest you setup API checks. They give a lot of warnings here about missing @since tags etc.
please make the comment style consistent (so here it would go behind *pDfltFrmFmt)
please move command to system.py so this can be reduced to "cmd_node_init".
Please note that according to http://www.w3schools.com, the values "table", "table-row", and "table-cell" are not supported in IE7 and earlier. IE8 requires a !DOCTYPE. http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp
Please note the comment on SC_GLOBSTR_STR_COUNT, which is the overall count of strings. So actually you need to insert and define STR_TABLE_COUNT to 533 and increment the value of SC_GLOBSTR_STR_COUNT to 534.
Please place functions in <code></code> tags throughout.
Please put code snippets into double back ticks in order to highlight them in the changelog (``computeChangeSets()``, ``persistAll()``, ``hasUnpersistedChanges()``)
please remove "border" and blank line between class definition and comment and consequently reduce it to a single line
Please remove the word Magic from this file too... - edit the file git commit --amend git gerrit-push Thanks
Please remove this log, it's a part of the if below
Please rename this to extcap-capture-filter or similar. The convention here is, that the extcap arguments exist together with non-extcap arguments in a binary. --capture and --fifo are the only exceptions, because they start the process and fifo is a generic argument.
Please see here: http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/6192/11/src/northbridge/intel/i945/acpi.c dev = dev_find_device(0x8086, 0x27a0, 0); if (!dev) dev = dev_find_device(0x8086, 0x2770, 0); if (!dev) return current;
please update this at https://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/39024
Please use $GLOBALS['TBE_TEMPLATE'] here, so the code is more consistent
Please use double quotes for EGL/egldefs.h and log/log.h. These headers are now local. Same comment for other files including them.
Please use gboolean (here and for the return value and etc) since that appears to be how this is actually used.
Please use import for java.util.Arrays, instead using explicitly here.
Please use logs instead of System.out. You can add a log4j configuration to redirect to stdout if you want to see these printings.
Please use one of the test helper methods which includes a timeout. Combining the takeResults() into this method does not seem like enough of a reason to add a new wait method. We need to be able to adjust the timeouts in auto testing, so minimizing the number of helper methods is rather important.
Please use org.eclipse.emf.compare.internal.utils.ComparisonUtil.isDeleteOrUnsetDiff(candidate) instead to also get the intended behavior for multi-valued attributes and unsets.
Please use uint64 or uint32 or uint16 if the size is known.
Please use: pywikibot.Timestamp.now().isoformat()
Please verify this is correct :-). This is as far I know the "most special" change I made, other then the OUString things.
PointContainer * points = this->m_Mesh->GetPoints();
Point-of-fact: it was the wait feature that you now find workable from Python... The '--nowait' argument disables that new feature, reverting back to prior behavior.
possible way to remove this constant and use information from setup.cfg: import os # Read setup.cfg of OSProfiler open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__))), 'setup.cfg') as setup_file: setup_lines = setup_file.readlines() #Parse version for line in setup_lines: if line.startswith('version'): version = line.split()[-1]
possibly add a commented out example of packet-foo.src
Possibly replace this stat with find $logdir -type f in the "for" line(135). We will save a stat call.
Prefer angle brackets for headers not provided by us.
Prefer ordered includes, i.e. VTK headers, vtksys headers, STL/system headers.
prefer to have variables as local as possible. This helps with long-term maintenance. for ( unsigned int i=0; .... { for ( unsigned int j=0; ... { } }
preferably remove this empty line. you apparently have the wrong commit-msg hook. how and when precisely did you obtain it?
presentation::AnimationEffect aEffect = presentation::AnimationEffect_NONE;
Probably "Selection count" (note lowercase 'c') is better. This is the string displayed in the status bar.
Probably want to make this if (this->InputTimeValues.size()<=1 && this->DisableResetCache == 0)
Problem is the floating image in license stops the bottom margin working. I've added in a cb div and added some margin top to the feedback box
project_id is none by default here and in _delete_tokens_for_user. Is the same if project_id is not provided.
provide any output provided by a successful command.
put a comment before this test, explaining what it's trying to test?
Put a comment, and explain two different use cases: * 1. Existing edit is deleted: DELETE /changes/<id>/edit * 2. Path in non existing edit is deleted, IOW new edit is created by deleting a path in current patch set for a change: DELETE /changes/<id>/edit/path%2fto%2ffile
Put all of this into a static helper method that returns a Map<String,String> already configured for the Sun JNDI names used below. Then we only need a map for connection pooling as an instance member.
Put this into a DEPS variable and reuse the value above in gwt_module() too?
quotad count already there. please remove this from your code.
Read my comment regarding this in previous patch sets
redundant, CUSTOMCONTEXT_HYBRISTEXTURE is defined for sure here
refs/users/ is sufficient prefix. No need for refs/meta. We should be plural like changes heads and tags.
Release after main inode is what patchset 2 has done I think.
Remove strerror(errno) part of this log, as gf_msg will do it when errno is passed
Removed the !commentPopupDialog.getEditable() check
Removed 'to' as the assertion is there for mostly documentation purposes.
Removing onboard devices instead of setting them to off can break the chipset configuration. This is the entire reason for this stuff to be in a devicetree.cb and to make the static.c to point to the correct setup functions. These devices are always on the board and the chip configuration will enable and disable (and hide) them based on the platform configuration and the device tree. Without this, everything would be a normal pci device enumeration and coreboot would be much much simpler... I also agree with Martin that, as a reference design, it is important to show the configuration as clearly as possible.
Rename objectCollapsibleButton to objectCollapsibleBox or objectCollapsibleGroupBox ?
rename to: initPropertyProviders? (and also in recompile_lib.)
renamed to __initPropertyProviders in this scope to indicate that we consider it private in this scope otherwise initPropertyProviders
Replace with a constant or use String.format("$0 $2",icon.getLocaion(),e.getLocalizedMessage())
Reuse the ChangeControl instance instead of loading the change again.
Right, changing an SwField, which is part of the document model during export is bad. An export operation should just read the document model and serialize it in some format. Can't you set m_bCitation depending on what the field type is? Just put a breakpoint on the SwField constructor, get a backtrace and see where it's created -- hopefully the caller knows the field type.
Right. Then why do you have the method_exists() check? It looked like you meant to check if a method exists before calling it but then never called the method. Just type hint $article as a WikiPage to make this clearer and get rid of that check. last_edit_title definitely needs a rename.
Run KWStyle in this file. Fix bracket indentations.
s / GD_MSG_VOLINFO_SET_FAIL /GD_MSG_VOLINFO_STORE_FAIL
s/data/key/ This variable name (in docs) is more important than conflicting with internal variable names. "data" isn't much more descriptive than "variable", "thing" or "stuff".
s/exit/continue/ Exiting the loop doesn't do a final update of v. The write to conflict with this read must happen during the setup for a subsequent iteration. This one does bother me. To be clear, what's going on is: v = a[0] go func() { x = v }() v = a[1] go func() { y = v }() There is no race involving the second goroutine, since its read is guaranteed to happen after the write of v = a[1]. The race is between the x = v and the v = a[1]. I don't understand why the race detector does not detect that misordering 100% of the time. I filed #10589 about this. At least this fixes the build so that we can detect future breakages while Dmitriy thinks about this one.
s/importsSet/pkgSet/ should explain that this set is only needed so we can create an duplicate free pkgList

same comment as above: use wmem_map_new() with file scope memory
Same here, toQt or just toVariant as it is taking a Json::Value.

Say what the commit does (add release notes, apply CSS only to content, formatting fix). If you want to put an ID, put it in the body (and using the git SHA of the previously merged commit is better so it works on both GitHub etc. and Gerrit).
See other comment about OUString together with ScResId. Just as short explanation: The current code creates a SchResId object which has an operator OUString which is called here. Then the OUString copy c'tor is called to generate a copy from the returned OUString.
Seems like we can make use of the dependent option gear in cmake/gmxOptionUtilities.cmake, so that the default is ON for real windows and off otherwise?
self._guestEventTime mast be set to time() on vm domDependent or else we would never report POWERING_UP.

Separate patch and please use a tab for consistency. A separate patch could unify that too I guess.
ServiceImpl? (To match the interface.) Or else rename all of them: DashboardServiceImpl, DashboardService, DashboardServiceAsync
session_args_t structure is in packet scope. Is this normal to allocate in file scope? And no need to set it to 0, you are assigning it the line below.
setPageTitle() takes a Message, so no need to change anything here.
Shift + left click or drag to extend T1 of a current range always changes T1 to T2 (and T2 to T1)
should another patchset be pushed, please change the leading blanks to tabs
Should be $table = new XMLDBTable('usr_watchlist_artefact'), right?
should be a local typedef in the single function that uses it
should be addAll with casting to List, no? please verify.
Should be renamed together with the class it tests.
Should be tied to the wiki it was started from, like the other global actions, in my opinion.
Should each sensor have it's own filterable field? I think that's what I was trying to determine (and came up with "yes"). I believe some are "common" (and share evtype_rvals), but I thought others have difference enumerations. Don't necessarily want to share a field name just because the enumeration is shared.
Should GenerateInputRequestedRegion be virtual in all classes? Perhaps there is not global rule. [johnsonhj@HansMBAir (git: master) ITK]$ git grep "^ *void GenerateInputRequestedRegion"|wc -l 95 [johnsonhj@HansMBAir (git: master) ITK]$ git grep "^ *virtual *void GenerateInputRequestedRegion"|wc -l 83
Should have caught this earlier, ret would be reset to 0 here on succesful cleanup of source, but actual migration may want to signal a failure with ret as -1, so we would need to use a different variable or reset ret to its original.
Should I fix this? or change it to a non-javadoc comment?
should probably also mention the the optimizer scale estmation was pushed into the parent class
Should probably say "... we are not clicking on the menu button"
Should the output of this filter always be Real? This cast seems like is should be done outside this filter. If it's required it may be able to be done in-place for some situations.
should the version be changed now that some methods are not available?
Should this be all of the groups and not just controllers?
Should this call Free(), or just remove Free() and put that code in here?
Should this include also the LJ PME contribution, either summed our as a separate line? I know that this functionality may change in the future, but for now would be better to keep up-to-date.
Should this just be func Run() { etc } and have callers explicitly call Register beforehand?
should this patch only be added if $(SYSTEM_MYSQL) is NO ?
should we mention the full classname here? TYPO3\Flow\Persistence\Doctrine\Service
Should we set "io->ci_ignore_layout = 1" under such case? then subsequent layout processing can be ignored.
Shouldn't be here (or anywhere, see my comment below re select).
shouldn't it free the allocated memory here and return null if mkstemp() fails?
shouldn't that be exp(-beta_i u_i) / sum_k exp(beta_k u_k)
shouldn't this function be called: rewrite_blockinstance_config note the 'c' in blockinstance so this would need the misisng 'c' and the calls to it
similar to previous diff; this is just moving the crop state from an SWT Button state to a flag in the wizard state object
Since all TNG constants in the header are prefixed with TNG I think it could be nice to just call this variable API_VERSION and then use TNG_API_VERSION in tng_io.cpp and switch the names in version.h.in.
Since BE was IE10 (as of the member var above) I think changing the member to edge is not a problem, but I would keep the IE8 default here, which does not hurt us, and will also not hurt third party stuff then.
Since the array is actually only used in one case, I'm not sure that makes sense. Added a comment instead.
since the spec says that the same format should be used for both critical options and extensions, I named the structures: optionsTuple, optionsTupleValue, and optionsTupleEmptyValue (I believe I needed the latter to marshal extensions with empty values where there is no double length prefix) - starting at Line 89 of certs.go. I used them in the marshalTuples and parseTuples. Regarding unmarshaling - please take a look at the current version, I wanted to use the same function for critical options and extensions, and to handle properly empty and non-empty values I believe some "low-level" handling is needed. I used an instance of optionsTupleValue structure to pass to Unmarshal (Line 186).
Since there is a Gerrit issue [1] for this bug, can you please add a reference to this bug as footer? Bug: issue 871 [1] http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=871
Since this script will go in ITK's tree and not the hooks, it should be licensed as the rest of ITK (which will soon be Apache but is not yet AFAIK). Besides, the rest of the Apache license infrastructure (LICENSE and NOTICE) is not present yet. Also, we should assign the copyright to the Insight Software Consortium for code going in ITK proper.
Since you are rewriting the entire file anyway, please try to put callers before callees, in general, so that reading the file top to bottom you usually know what a function is for when you see it. So: gen casebody caseClauses genCases
sizeof("") includes the trailing '\0'. Couple more of this
Smart pointers are initialized to NULL already in there constructor.
So does this method import to both the in memory cache and the disk cache? If so, that would be the source of some performance hits. This method should: 1. Add the image to the in memory cache synchronously 2. Add the image to the disk cache asynchronously If it doesn't do this currently, lets split the logic up now.
So in the end, you don't even need the AGESA struct. You might think that casting to a struct makes the code more readable, but in this case, it also hides nasty bugs.
So it should be also fixed in QCryptographicHash documentation
So much repetition :( Can you pull this out as some kind of utility function setup_loopback_mode? Perhaps create an MBIMTestCase subclass call MBIMDataTestCase
So that means to also change comparisons with STRING_NOTFOUND (which is defined to 0xFFFF), lastIndexOf() returns -1 if not found, so the condition here can be simplified to if (nPos > 0)
So this is a kind of helper method? I'd suggest then making it "private": def _benchmark(self, flavor, ...):
So those need to be enabled on as as-needed basis. Kconfig knows about SSE and its ilk. Noted, will take care of it.
So, is it safe to use it in production? Or should we add a warning that it should be disabled before putting your app in prod? If it's safe to use it in production, how about enabling it by default? Or do we push it to GWT 3.0?
Sorry but I didn't get why we need 199 here - to trigger some update to 200 afterwards? What if we just fix the update for afterwards then?!?
Sorry, I mean paintLine(createDisplayString(line), line, y, lineHeight, gc, display);
Sorry, this is still unacceptable. ImplEESdrWriter::ImplWriteShape() is used by both the binary export and the OOXML filter, you need to set the OOXML flag in the OOXML filter. Jut put a breakpoint on this line in the debugger, see its backtrace, and set the flag in the first method that is already OOXML-specific, and pass the bool around till this line.
Sorry, wasn't paying enough attention to the context (clearly the param is moved to the heap) and instead assumed that if esc was not EscHeap, that therefore it was not "heap".
Sorry. I did not closely looked into log date part. Thanks for this patch
Sounds good to me. I shall handle these changes in the separate patch. Thanks!
sounds good. will update once the dependence: http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/33453/ is merged.
Sounds like it should be disabled. It is reasonable to run a whole multi-sim workflow (em, equil phases, simulate) in the same set of multi-dirs, so being able to use mdrun_mpi -multidir the-dirs* -deffnm equil-npt would be a nice thing. I haven't tried -multidir with a non-default equil-npt that I remember though. Should we be looking at doing the directory change for -multidir earlier than we do?

Stefan, I'm just mostly replicating the what is done when including CSS styled content's TS using the include static select. To me your questions show you did not look at the issue. Can we please get this through? Apart from the above, no there is not a filename, and yes there needs to be a slash.
Still have a question: why do you add changes for software_config and software_deployment tables here? As far I understand they were fixed in previous patch for both tables.
Still I don't agree on treating the operation differently depending on whether the editor is modified or not. In my opinion this should not affect the behavior. What if, for example, there's only one change in the document, the user adds/remove BOM, but then triggers undo (which would bring the editor to not modified state again)? What would one expect?
strange parameter name ... I suppose it was late when you added it ;-)
strdup_printf with just a %s can be replaced with just strdup :) This copy is necessary though, since the string coming into the function might be packet-scope
string.join() is deprecated. Please use ','.join(vmList).
Style: Given totalCount is guaranteed to be zero here, just return zero - it's clearer to the reader what's being returned.
style-nit: I think spaces around "+" are preferred in Gerrit's code base.
Style-nit: Please don't reformat these comment blocks.
stylistic issue - declare variables as close to the first use as possible

Suppose I am an administrator, I will look into the log file to find what is happening in VDSM. You can not suppose administrator to check the console or the code to know this. IMO, every faulty path should have a log in the log file. You can argue that many places in VDSM are not doing these, but it is a good practice for system service program.
Sure it's more readable, but how about: HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection(); â€¦ hrc.add(foo.addXxxHandler(â€¦)); â€¦ hrc.add(bar.addYyyHandler(â€¦)); or: HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection(); â€¦ HandlerRegistration hr1 = â€¦ hrc.add(hr1); â€¦ HandlerRegistration hr2 = â€¦ hrc.add(hr2); I.e. accumulate HandlerRegistration instances right into the HRC (which can be a field of your class) rather than into local variables that you then pass as a whole to the factory method. If you want varargs, you could add an addAll() method: HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection(); hrc.addAll(hr1, hr2); or with a Collection or Iterable as argument: HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection(); hrc.addAll(Arrays.asList(hr1, hr2)); Note that Sencha has not felt the need to add such collection/varargs to their GroupingHandlerRegistration: http://docs.sencha.com/gxt/3/com/sencha/gxt/core/shared/event/GroupingHandlerRegistration.html Similar for GWT-P's registerHandler on their PresenterWidget base class: http://arcbees.github.io/GWTP/javadoc/apidocs/com/gwtplatform/mvp/client/HandlerContainerImpl.html#registerHandler(com.google.web.bindery.event.shared.HandlerRegistration)
Sure, I can switch over to a white-list. I just killed the ones I really didn't like (e.g. MD5 :).
Sure, I will comment and revise this function. Sorry for the confusion.
syncop_ functions return -errno as ret. This can be passed to the gf_msg function.
TableID is specified to be 8 characters. While the original version broke that by adding a space, I guess it's simply ignored. With this change, the final "M" would be dropped, too. (When you fix that, also cut OEMID to 4 characters, it's 32bit. ACPI5.0 19.5.28)
tabs instead of whitespaces as in the rest of the file
tdf#... is unnecessary. Rather document why this is done, if necessary.
template< unsigned int TDimension, class T > Prefer a more descriptive name for the second template argument.
Templatizing this would make the change smaller, as you don't need to make it a member function.
Thanks a lot for your review. What do you think about "in the adapted class"? Anyway, I'm going to bother some of the guru to hear what they think about it...
Thanks for fixing it. > What if the author disagrees with your negative vote and writes a reply to your comment explaining why he disagrees? If this change is filtered out there is a high chance to you miss this reply. But with this argumentation it is even more dangerous for me how it was originally: -label:Code-Review=-2,user=self Why? I am maintainer and have power of -2. I review a change and decide to put my veto on it. But we all do mistakes, we all have feelings? In the end we are all people. What is if it was a wrong veto? The contributor try to explain me, in additional comments why he thinks the veto was wrong and that the impact of the change is *very* minimal and that thousands of people from hundreds of companies can't upgrade to the new version of the product and all that because of his veto. Nothing helps. Why? Because I used your dashboard template, put this line and this change was filtered out: -label:Code-Review=-2,user=self
Thanks Ian, I was not aware of this. Created b/15574371.
Thanks Martin, I will do it. It will look much better.
Thanks! Will translate this step-by-step guide into dev-gwt-super-dev-mode.txt or some such in the next patch set.
Thanks. It's unclear how i missed it: $ buck targets --show_output lib/gwt:codeserver buck-out/gen/lib/gwt/codeserver/gwt-codeserver-2.6.1.jar Done.
That bit can go as well, but it's copied from the commit message - the primary goal of the commit is to ensure that things don't crash, however there was an attempt at making the fix work with the least slowdown. Perhaps that bit can go out and just mention the stuff about re-entrancy :)
That commit mentions that a GCC 5 change motivates forbidding -fPIE, but I haven't seen any reason to also forbid it for GCC 4. That configuration has been "not broken" since Qt 5.0. Maybe some rationale for that can be put into the changelog too, because it would seem easy to check __GNUC__ before deciding to #error. There *are* also people using boost build and other non-qmake, non-cmake buildsystems too, so limiting the #error could have been wise.
That could be changed, I imagine, but Jenkins will probably add "helpful" spacing too... :-( If there was a way to have Jenkins keep a per-build archive, then we could have it make available the corrected files?
That instead should be const sal_Unicode* pParseEnd; because rtl::math::stringToDouble() expects sal_Unicode const ** pParsedEnd at that place. Code probably shouldn't even compile like it is.
That is great - it also means you can move that line outside of the if/else. You also need another in6_addr: you have to have both dest and gateway (though for default and host you only use one or the other). Same is needed in the v4 case.
That is intended. We are already making sure that multiple events are okay for us (see onHashChanged). So I think this is the most practical way.
That just doesn't seem right, ones created by a call to generate_key are trivially generated and not imported. If we're at the point where this code is lying to you then the app can't trust the ORIGIN tag regardless.
That means we'll have to add an extra boolean field to every member. It'll make serialization size bigger as well as resident AST memory go up. I'm happy to change it, but it seems like it trades off memory for readability. You'd still have to handle "", because that's the way Java annotations work, you cannot have a default value of 'null'
That this was removed is clearly wrong, and seems to be the cause for the test which hang. It doesn't always hang but sometimes. For more details: http://redmine.gromacs.org/boards/6/topics/261?r=266
That was actually the original code. If dest <= src and you're only copying one byte at a time, if you start from the top you'll never overwrite the data you haven't copied yet. Otherwise, you have to start from the other end. *dest++ = *src memcpy;, but memcpy is not *dest++ = *src;. To quote from the pretty short man page: The memory areas must not overlap. That's the difference between memcpy and memmove. If there was no overlap at all (which we could check for) then you could use memcpy, and that would make the normal case work like it always has. But I'm working on a change to add optimized versions of memmove for x86 and ARM. In order to test them I'm going to implement them in the chromeos tree, and then to transfer them over I've put together a big series of patches to upstream so they should just apply.
That will unfortunately only work if there are no 4-core Intel Xeons that work in dual-socket configuration because we could confuse a workstation that has two such processors with an 8-core Xeon E5 in single-socket configuration.
That's a bit of a philosophical discussion. I thought about it earlier, but the reason for limiting the range is that we only use the single precision range in the SIMD parts of Gromacs - since all algorithms in particular need to work if the user has set the precision to single - we only use double to improve precision, not range. One _could_ of course add double precision range tests, but then the next obvious question is why we allow routines to provide incorrect results for NaN, +-infinity, negative zero, etc? And, of course, not to mention - why we allow more than 1 ulp error :-) For the error functions I actually experimented a bit with only providing accurate results in a smaller-than-double-precision-range, and this might still be a useful optimization strategy in the future. Thus, I like the idea of merely testing what we actually need, and if somebody comes up with a neat idea to improve that while only altering things we don't need, that should fundamentally be a good thing(TM)!
That's impossible to say until somebody invests the time and effort to try lots of different function approximations on that architecture to see if they can come up with something better. For now it is the fastest approach.
That's not what I was saying. Just like public static float getMdpiScaleFactor(Density density) { if (density == Density.ANYDPI) { density = Density.XXHIGH.getDpiValue(); } return density.getDpiValue() / (float) Density.MEDIUM.getDpiValue(); } But whatever, it's not a big deal.
The "git commit" line needs a continuation character to include the following '-m' line. However, you should be able to fold the entire commit message into one quoted string starting on the above line. Be sure to leave the second line blank.
The above 7 lines repeats a bit, and could go and be a function.
The above code from 2008101602 is present in the 1.1.0RC2_RELEASE so therefore existed before the 1.1.0_RELEASE so needs to be removed.
The 'all' link is a link that is js controlled - is 'follow' the right word to use here?
the arguments to init should be documented somewhere.
The built search tree of mdds::flat_segment_tree is not preserved on copy/assignment. You have to call build_tree() here. Or do it just before use (and use is_tree_valid() to check if it is necessary, as every line is used more than once).
The change here reminds me that also some of the new oc..._MS opcodes may need an entry here. Could you take care of those in a follow-up patch?
The CherryPick RESTApi acts on revisions (e.g. patchsets), not Changes. Just like the review RestApi does. Hence I don't think that it should go into ChangeApi. Look at the REST-url, and you will see it differs quite from the other RESTFul commands in ChangeApi. If you still want me to add it to ChangeApi, I can do that. But this is how I reasoned about where to put it.
The code in this library was generated by emugen and then manually modified ('vi' transformations) to match this library need. This code will be replaced with driver implementation.
The column names shouldn't be in curly brackets, because that adds the dbprefix, and we only want that on the table names.
the comment is a lie ;). it has almost entirely bit rotted at this point. i'll push an update upstream. we def support executing `emake` via other tools as we use it that way in other places. wrt PATH, unless dbus itself resets the PATH, it should inherit the active one which will include that. i don't consider this a leakage.
The comment should indicate that using the itk3DVersorRigid transform is often a much better transform to use during optimization proceedures from both a speed perspective (lower dimensional parameter space), and stability standpoint (versors do not suffer from rotational gimble lock).
the condition !pProfile->m_bIsValid must always be true here, so rather use SAL_WARN
The convention is to have all mappers static in order to reduce their instantiations as they have no state. Please extract it into a private static class.
The correct one is according to JamesF "wiki" instead of "index.php". He's fixing it up on the server.
The doc comments are inheritted from the parent class(es)
The documentation here is pretty much the same, but the errors occur in different circumstances.
The doxygen documentation will also be a bit better if you add \related ArrayRef to these functions (and similarly for the ConstArrayRef ones).
The error for the operation. If there is no error, this value will evaluate to `false`
The general way to do this is $(TOP)/src/southbridge etc. etc.
The histograms themselves don't use multipoint storage. The input for them often would be, but in this case it isn't.
The IDE feature does not provide any team dependent plug-ins any longer but it makes sense to keep the dependency. I didn't realize that team.ui contributed a bunch of functionality that doesn't necessarily require a Mylyn team extension.
The if condition will be true when isDetailsRequired() == true and volumeName is empty. Will it work? Do you need to add a validation against this scenario?
The include won't become redundant as the macros will still be needed. Instead the replicated Check{C,CXX}CompilerFlag.cmake will become redundant.
The incorrect spacing gets fixed here - https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/121369/
The indentation on these lines seems to be wrong (same for Backend call below).
The language style needs to be instructive rather than conversational here. This is primarily intended for the software guide. Remove the "Therefore" and "For instance" and make the sentences more authoritative.
The list of maintainers seems to be organized alphabetically by translator name. I guess tiering should be listed after quota.
The logic to check for checkpoint restart was added in release-5-1, but in master we changed the name to startingFromCheckpoint
The main points are hat we avoid to repeat the code block below twice (or three when merging the JRE task), and reading each task is easier to know exactly what the diferences ares
The main thing about "Dev Mode Off" is that it works even when the code server isn't running. Perhaps it's less useful with this change, but I don't want to remove it yet.
The map should also be updated, probably via loop and calls to remove().
the method does not what the name says. It should just be named "updateCommitButtons" and take a boolean. So you can use this in another place too.
The mode of both files was changed to 755, that means the executable bit was added.
the name is very generic; yet what it does is just poll for updates. The problem goes away if the script moves to vdsm-tool.
The new/better URL would be http://tracker.phpbb.com/browse/PHPBB3-3832
the old code only replaced one instance not all but the string shouldn't contain more than one anyways...
The only reason I put it in here and not the missed snap function was that the new_volinfo was available to this one.
The output HTML is along the lines of "<dt>{{int:this-message}}</dt><dd><a href="/w/api.php?lots=of&parameters=here">api.php?lots=of&parameters=here</a></dd>". The colon seems implied by the <dt>; I'm not sure whether it should be added in the messages or with CSS or just left implied, or if we should have these be punctuated as sentences and ignore the semantically-implied colon.
The performance characteristics of ArrayList should be similar enough to use here instead of introducing JsObjectArray.
The phpdoc states that an array is returned. Would it be better to return an array() instead of NULL?
The point is to use double quotation marks " instead of single quotation marks ' for consistency within MediaWiki core and all extensions.
the previous event may not be traceEvGoCreate, like this scenario: when trace start goroute is in syscall and then exitsyscall and finally goStart. For this case, we can't access the stack information because the previous event is traceEvGoSysExit which doesn't contain the stack. I just think out a solution: when we receive a traceEvGoSysExit, we reserve the gocreate event by link it and access it here. But I don't know if there are any other cases or any side effect, any idea?
The previous one says "server assigned". Is the difference intentional?
The problem is, at the opensource side, if this breaks the app, people will try to debug it by themselves or worse they will just give up and do not update to the latest GWT version - I don't want that to happen, especially for this release. On the other hand if somebody hits the problem, it is easy to point them to the workaround. This is not ideal situation but that is what I prefer right now.
The problem might be if you're running cmake outside "git" repository (dist package)?
the propvalue parameter type is not quite idiomatic ;) In general - since this method gets called multiple times, prolly worth buffering the xml ...
The refreshing of the mergeable state is already implemented in MergeOp.verifyMergeability(Change). I would prefer to have the code only in one place.
The replaceTo will need to use the newly to be created LangID value. Same as for bo_CN, are the codes verbatim copied from dz_BT in which case only a ref="dz_BT" would be needed? Or aren't some needed to be adapted to IN country conventions?
the return value of NULL doesn't look right. it means even in the presence of read/write failures it will still reboot into recovery mode and show NO COMMAND to users. don't have a fix in mind though.
The same strange *.wdt.* package Should it be 'wst'?
The size here is now just the size of the struct, hence the names (old/new) will not be a part of the dict. Further, dict_set_bin, takes in a pointer, that it strores in the xattr/dict and later is freed when this dict is destroyed. In the case of passing a pointer which is a structure containing another pointer, the dict routines cannot encode this into the dict. Overall, as info is passed to be stored as a dict, the above mechanism of allocating a pointer within info and passing this would fail to send these values across and also leak memory for the allocated info->buffer.
The Slerp I was thinking of, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slerp doesn't seem to be in all caps - is this something else? It does say somewhere to avoid acronyms but there are exceptions (this may be one of them).
The three tests above that checks namespaces should probably grouped together. They seems to be copy pasted and just change which setting is gathered. You could uses a dataProvider too. That will build an array of tests cases and pass the case to a test method. Anyway, you should extract the foreach / assert in a new internal method such as assertNamespaceIsValid()
The toolchain file should stop here. It should be about description and setting compilers. Period. See http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Cross_Compiling. I figure the principle is that the toolchain files are somewhat transferable between projects.
The type would be TestNamespace::PtrSecCertificateGetData vs PtrSecCertificateGetData though. I suggest moving the typedefs below the QT_BEGIN_NAMESPACE at line 94. Feel free to ignore this suggestion though since it's valid C++ either way.
The usage of exception specification here is very bad! If any only exception is thrown, then the program will terminate. Imagine what will happen if that occurred in Slicer! Have you verified that not a single method usage can throw an exception of a different kind?
The use of 'count' confuses me. Would this be cleaner? self.assertIn('Unexpected method call', unicode(e))
The user might still want to disable it... Unlike the other options, this one does not need a pirq_table.c or mptable.c file be sitting around... Generally dropping these tables from the build is almost never worth it, since most OSes expect something there.
The value is having an ABI compatible way to pass the proper information to ramstage from romstage. There's no reason to allow something that can change to break in the future. Take for example the current different sizes of the previous space reserved in the cache_as_ram.inc files. Things that are brittle will break. What is the bare minimum amount of info that needs to be passed? Isn't it just a bar and a couple of endpoints?
The variable you should probably use here is U_BOOT_FDT_USE, defined in make.conf. I agree the name is not great - we can change it if you like. But the intention is that this variable tells you which fdt to use, so there should be no need for this sort of logic in ebuilds.
The word "Selected" should be capitalized. I'm unsure of the use of "Area" here, BTW. Maybe "Cut Selection"?
Then maybe the loop can be inside this method, it would be more consistent with the fact that 'Starts' is plural...
Then shared_pointer is probably the way to go (if you're happy with the cost of refcounting them).
Then this one can use SHA1 and another patch could change the existing instances.
then what's wrong with using new Color(0xFFFFFF) ?
There are many times MDS start/stop, if the client does not umount, then there will recovery waiting every time the MDS start/stop, which is unnecessary for this test.
There are still several rows for the distinct blocks and up to one separate row with no related block element, so we still need the gorup by clause
There are two cases to be covered: 1) When the tokens are empty (this is the one you did); 2) Also, when you do have 1 comment token but the offset is *before* its begin.
There is a bit more information provided by _getExitedVmStats. Do we want to have it as part of an event?
There is a comma missing after share/gallery/sounds .
there is a warning "unused variable w" here ... i'm guessing this should compare w.size() with 3, right? i'll push a fix for that to master...
There is more information https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer#ulimit_-v about alternative
There is no need for a "continue" here, since it means the same as the normal program flow...
There is no need to reference $wizard, it's an object
There is no point in defining those private static variables, we could just use the string literal directly in the methods. It was like that originally because the original definitions were public static final's. We then switched to methods so that they could be overriden.
There is no putComment method. Shorten this and just put it on one line: checkState(psId != null, "setPatchSetId must be called first"); Developers debugging a failure can look at the Java stack trace to see how they got into this situation. What matters to them more is the call site where the object was misused, not which entry point into the object the error was discovered by.
There is no VDSM action here, only database - just make the command transactive, and save yourself all this hassle.
There may be a minor bug here in that there can be a TMPFAIL at authentication time. This doesn't seem to handle that.
There should be some separation of code from the rest of the text, even if it's clear that it's a URL, to ensure that nobody gets the idea to translate it. <kbd> may be enough, but having quotes, too, is a good idea.
there should be } else { rv = get_env_plugin_info(pi); In this case the lcb_cntl user will get correct effective type
There's already bunch of strcpy calls scattered throughout this file anyways.
There's no actual need to have this routine similar to how it's done in bit-rot-scrub.c since there just one (1) option to reconfigure. Keep it simple and just do a GF_OPTION_{INIT,RECONF} in the appropriate function.
there's no point shuffling the deckchairs though. assume that anything that's not C++ yet is a bug and should just be moved straight to C++.
these are essentially renamed to ProjectScopedPayload.version etc in a dependent change: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/162196/
These are good, but I think we need another test which exercises the untested path in fault.py. Otherwise, if it is in fact unreachable, we need to eliminate that code path.
These are nice tests. Can we put them on AbstractHasData directly instead of the Table subclass? The one bit that you'd have to keep here would be the test with the alternative TableBuilder.
These are wrapper functions, and will use in test cases directly.
These calls don't do the same thing. As a result, lockNow() must be called unconditionally.
These methods should also probably go in the anonymous namespace.
These misaligned typedefs should be causing KWstyle errors. Are you not getting any?
These nOpCode have of course to be eFacOpCode then.
These two comments seem to be for the block of commands.
These two methods are business logic, so they don't belong in the API, they should be part of the AddVm command, so that the same logic is used when using the API or the GUI.
These two variables were defined separately in the previous version. Now that you need them in every method, you could just declare them at the first utilization (applies to the other methods too).
These variables are only used in the next call, I'd remove them
They could probably be combined, but the speed would be the same. We still need to write the address out first before we can auto-increment. Let's leave that to later when/if it gets moved to the southbridge wrapper
They're not, and can't be. Same as with proto fields that this code is a copy of... and quite a few other pre-existing Lua code spots too for that matter.
This || breaks -e. If you need this information you need to reimplement -e yourself. if ! go build -a std; then failed=true if $sete; then exit 1 fi fi
This and the preferences load below have a race condition. If the plugin load finishes first the user might see the existing account dashboard screen instead of their first My link if token = MINE.
this beforeTest block is used all over the place in the tests, we just try to get it to a clean state.. its slow but it works :/
This bootmode is allover the place in ACPI too. I was considering doing enum with follow-up later.
This can probably be removed if the suggestions for performOk and performApply are implemented.
This can't be here, since it only executes on the first CMake run, making LINEAR_ALGEBRA_LIBRARIES break on subsequent runs.
This can't guarantee there won't be two pipeline running concurrently for one replication.
This causes a warning about missing UID in Eclipse. Fixed with: https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/59929/
This changes the semantics... you actually want to die if there's no Title given, but we have a pageid.
This check is improved in https://review.typo3.org/#/c/32645/1
This check was removed along with the corresponding GenFramebuffers and GenRenderbuffers calls because they are redundant(see CheckFBOResources bellow) and the allocated buffers are leaked. This is one of the bugs that my patch fixes. In my patch the buffers are allocated only once(with error checking) in the AllocateFBOResources method.
This chipset needs to override the generic __smbus_read_byte().
This class should be for launch specific utilities, but I agree with you, it makes sense to consolidate until it becomes unwieldy.
This code is broken. $this->storage needs to be changed
this code now returns a reference to a temporary object
This code, RefreshLabelImageJob and PermissionAuthoritySessionManagerListener could be encapsulated in a single class whose responsability is to manage lock decorations update. And this class could be named LockDecorationUpdater, like that this class could be reused for potential others views.
This comment doesn't sound right. This if statement should be removed as lapd_handle should already be populated.
This condition is always true. I assume the condition you meant was n != ptrSize. Though I see you removed this condition altogether in CL 9704 (rebase failure?).
This conditional is always true, so it should be removed as confusing.
This could be done with a static const char* [] data array, using the enum value as an index. It would generate much less code in the end.
This could impact the development context when doing a partial compilation, is it noticable? We should re-use the filename (micro-op).
this could probably be determined dynamically at build time. but not in this patch.
This creates an unnecessary garbage list. Sets.newHashSet should accept an Iterable.
This depends on how we define the ABI. For function prototype like "void foo(float a, double b, float c);". Now the argument registers would be "a(s0), b(s2/s3=d1), c(s1)". We could remove this unless we define ABI to use argument registers like "a(s0), b(s2/s3=d1), c(s4)"
This displays the opening curly brace, but not the closing one. Is that intentional?
This does not correspond to an issue on the gerrit issue tracker [1]. Issues should be listed in the change footer in the form: Bug: Issue 1234 [1] http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/list
This does not really explain what the issue was. When new SD creation failed, failure status was not checked and flow continued to try and attach the SD to a pool which obviously failed and returned a storage domain not found error instead of the creation failure. SD creation status is now checked before proceeding.
This doesn't do any correctness tests of the file, while a start that they exist, I could just be touch'ing files.
This doesn't look quite intuitive to me. Maybe I am not used to this style. I like something as below. However, if you find the current style better, feel free to keep it. self.k8s_api = _create_k8s_api(k8s_master_url)
this doesn't make sense to me. Why can we distinguish it? What depends on what happening before what?
this doesn't make too much sense to me, as this file lives in the same directory (hence double quotes). and the use of double quotes with private/ is inherently bogus.
This doesn't seem right -- should it not be left as destination dir?
This doesn't work properly when the index is negative (e.g. time is before the offset).
This entire code above this comment can be deleted as long as the "dp = node.data.parsoid" is fixed to set it to {} when node.data or node.data.parsoid is missing.
This example contains both actual examples ("refs/*") and metalanguage ("permission"). Maybe pick one representation and stick to it? [access "<ref>"] <permission> = group Administrators or [access "refs/*"] read = group Administrators (Open re what formatting to apply to metalanguage.)
This file now has Windows line endings. @Jan: Could you verify that you have core.autocrlf=input configured in your Tycho repository clone?
This follows the common toXXX naming convention and implementation style used in Guava. I need fix the documentation.
This functionality is insanely useful for out of the box development against a random sysroot. This would also be a fairly insane place to remove this if block, even if I was feeling particularly murderous.
This hides preference and makes it unavailable. I think that fetching it (if exists) and appending to a new preference is better.
This is a Maven project, and Maven's default build directory is "target" (see also the .classpath file generated by M2Eclipse)
This is a mis-rendering in Gerrit. The actual code is properly indented.
This is a refactoring from my side that sneaked in when I split the commit. I'll revert this asap since it adds nothing to this change.
This is a special and important message. May be use something like P_MSG_STALE_HANDLE_REMOVE_FAILED here?
This is a weird format. It won't close twice actually, and it's not to handle the exception. There is an infinite loop from L1537 to L1581. In each iteration, it opens the zipfile. Before getting into another iteration, it needs to close the zipfile... I've moved L1583 inside the loop to make it less weird.
This is an attempt to clear the following dashboard error: https://open.cdash.org/viewBuildError.php?buildid=3611001
This is an unrelated change that should be dropped.
This is better, but the registered variable is unnecessary: while True: ... if register_models(): return # or break
this is bogus: for IOS now both --with-darwinssl and --with-nss are set
this is confusing. I think this needs to be called PluggablePrefix or something of that nature. To call it Service is confusing to me.
This is device init path, is not it? So changing the od_track_declares after the fact would not retroactively enable this feature? We might as well change it to a module parameter then if this is the way we want to go?
This is done now. The regex will now not be applied on some invalid versions where it was before. Some types of invalid versions will still match the regex, though that is outside of the concerns of this function. It is not a version number validator after all.
this is escapable, p['title'] could be something like '"><script>dodgycode</script><a href="'
This is in the wrong place and will cause multiple prints per class when running in parallel. _inject_tag_mapping moves variables to unittest result object utresult.mapping.var moves to utresult.var. However the vars aren't being used so it does not do anything. The dump_results handles printing of the results for the parallel version and as such needs to be updated to achieve what you are looking for.
this is just a nit and I don't actually care, but I skimmed and noticed that other operation strings were <verb>ing, eg 'Getting'. I'm not sure how consistent that is, or if you want them to be consistent.
This is more like an invalid option, not out of memory.
This is more obvious in this file than the other. You should be escaping the periods in your regular expressions. I know that it will match the period in the URL anyway, but we want it to *only* match the period. Also, you should use specific matches for scid, height and width, rather than the period (match anything). Assuming that you're just matching numbers, '[0-9]+', or tentatively '\d+' would be better here. One more thing, if these sites provide copy-and-paste embed tags, these matches will need to be able to deal with those too - currently they look like they will just modify the URL in-place, and this is definitely not what we want.
This is nearly true. glusterd's connection management and NLM (gluster-nfs) uses @name different than THIS->name. I am removing @ctx from the argument list.
This is not following the style for the other source files
This is not necessary. The same array can be used as multiple "things" without any problems. Just make sure that code handles it correctly. Don't forget to update the documentation in the header.
this is per loc_handle which is CHANGELOG_CATALOG handle. This should remain here and set per each MDT catalog but not per whole context.
This is problematic, because you know you have Go code passing a Go pointer into C. Maybe you had that before and I didn't notice. I don't think we should put code like that in our examples.
This is quite sneaky. This doesn't cover QWebView::setPage(0) for example, you'll still be attached to the old window. But given that this code shouldn't change too much in the future, calling updateWindow in all different setView/setPage isn't going to break less, so +2 anyway.
This is the line which triggers the crash. createQmlObject() requires the calling context to be valid. If this callback is invoked from C++ via the event loop, it has a chance to crash. Note that using Damian's repro also uncovered a crash in QNetworkAccessFtpBackend::closeDownstreamChannel() which could hide the crash issue in QML, but that's a separate issue which needs to be tracked separately (the fix is trivial, just a null ptr check on the ftp ptr).
This is the same as in the underlying OS calls, and this same construct is also used in the nbsearch pair loop, as it minimizes the amount of code the caller needs to write for correct looping (and is quite easy to implement, as there's only one function that returns something).
This is the simplest way to make it build. The complicated way would be to change doBeforeTest so it throws a Throwable instead of an Exception.
This is unnecessary, only MWExtensionInspector uses nodeModel
This is what I figured even if we define a column type as integer it is still allowed by sqlalchemy to have strings! This allowed user_id to be stored as string regardless of its definition.Things would fail when we have LDAP and a regular DB like postgres. However this is present in other models like tokens where user_id is defined as Integer.So this all together should be a separate issue.
This isn't a very good function name.. (I assume that it doesn't initialize everything in memcached).. init_allocation_hooks() would probably be a better name..
This isn't C. Stop comparing it with C. What you are doing here with the brightness is just redefining the same thing. Both boards you touched have the same definitions for the brightness, \DSPC.BRTU and \DSPC.BRTD, so it makes limited sense to redefine them as something interim.
This isn't going to pass pep8 anyway because this line is too long and the parameters to getattr don't have proper spacing. And why are we still looking at exc.message here?
This just feels wrong. The test setup code should not be writing to the notedb separately; there should be a method in PatchLineCommentsUtil that writes to the appropriate storage(s) based on the config.
This line ought to use the variable to say: 'token' => "A token previously acquired with $action",
This makes sure we don't have a bug where we silently drop object files
This may result in broken implementations since they could already have a longer URL. Highly unlikely, but possible.
This means the folder structure is not as expected? I guess we had always as follows: /pywikibot /pywikibot/comms /pywikibot/... <others> /scripts /scripts/i18n /scripts/maintenance /tests /tests/data /tests/i18n
This method looks really strange, it seems to allow to get or create a view model context at the same time. The parameter set is confusing. It is not part of this review, but please add a BR to discuss this separatly
This method now only sends email; I would change the name to reflect this fact.
this must be count > CFS_PAGE_SIZE - 1, otherwise the kbuf[count] = 0; would overflow into the next page is the write is eaxctly page-sized.
This needs to have been initialized to the correct size here. JacobianType jacobian( dim, transform->NumberParameters())
this parameter doesnt currently exist in compat; I dont know why it is being introduced here.
This patch evelvate context to fix tempest exeption unauthorized
this rather looks like an IllegalArgumentException looks like we should check this earlier when setURI is called and already fail there if a URI is already set
This repeats the name of the test, better use convert() as the other tests. If you think it is more clear, change all the tests, probably in another patch.
This says 6 parameters, of which 3 have to be given and 3 are optional. If the function expects 4-6 it should be 6; 0; 0; 0; 0; 1; 1; You can check in the Function Wizard what/how it is displayed.
This second key is not needed, this array contains a list of regex group names pointing to a (pre-)master key.
This seemed to be triggered too hurly. So I'm not sure that actually work.
This seems a bit error prone and hacky to me. What if $contentContext->getInaccessibleContentShown() was TRUE before. It would be FALSE afterwards (probably not relevant here, but maybe elsewhere). What about a second argument in "getNode()" that allows to even fetch hidden/protected nodes?
This seems confusing to me. It reads like "If -ENOSYS is returned on the 1st iteration, then FMR is not supported", which gave me the impression that "-ENOSYS can be returned in later iterations too, in which case it does not indicate FMR is not supported". Rather, please consider: if (rc == -ENOSYS) { /* device does not support FMR */ LASSERT(i == 0); break; }
This should also be converted GF_VALIDATE_OR_GOTO, take this as global comment
This should also be updated to match the actual latest kernel version as above.
this should be 0. I believe the empty username is a valid name.
This should be a programlisting with language 'ini'
This should be alright to change as if it wasn't updated in the last install this one will run. Both work as upgrade paths as it tests with no salt set if nessecary
this should be called with client list lock held, instead of osc lock.
this should be done (if any) when first connection is established. and I do think that it is a mistake to do so. please move all the engine variables into engine side, do not modify options, there is no technical need to do so. this includes the destination address and destination port. let's makes lives easier for us. if you call the variable the same, you can even have same file symlinked at /etc/ovirt-engine/engine.conf.d and /etc/ovirt-engine/fence....conf.d/ to provide the same options. So you can even consider putting it at engine local config. But please avoid complexity result from database updates, and move the variables to the component that actually use them.
this should be done without open/close of the editor. Just by checking the mapping
This should be just 'Authentication required' to make the message consistent with other REST endpoints.
This should be rather initialized with an empty collection.
This should be references with an 's' â€“ see Cite.git, i18n/core/en.json line 38.
This should be safe because this string isn't really used in the GUI - it's used as one of the arguments in a later format string, so it's copied. In fact I could (and probably should) just use NULL instead of packet_scope().
This should be: 'fields' => array('socialprofile'), since everything (the old messaging system info and the new social profile websites) is now 'socialprofile'. We differentiate among these with 'note' field.
this should better be moved to a signal in IWizardFactory then, I suppose. but different patch.
This should now depend on a python_library() that contains tools/gerrit/api.py.
This should only be added if the RGBZ view plugin is going to be built. Maybe the proper place to add this test is in that plugin.
This should probably be dlfcn, but I'm not sure. It might be better to split this into another file, and call it something like pthread_dlfcn_test.cpp to indicate this is really a test that is also testing dl related functionality.
This should probably be ignore. It is not part of the explicit ITK style specification.
This should probably be moved above the goos=="openbsd" check so that unknown options on OpenBSD also force cgo lookups.
This should really check self.client.can_send_version() and send the primitive of the object with the old version if you can't send the new one. You can find examples of this in compute/rpcapi.
This switches on distinct locales only, not on a primary language value where the secondary value may be different. This should instead be switch (ctl & LANGUAGE_MASK_PRIMARY) and ...
This TODO will have to wait for a later bug fix, because it's used when users belong to multiple institutions (the progress bar gives them a menu to determine which institution to show, and that relies on the param). It's not a *huge* security issue having this. It just allows users to see what the completion goals are for other institutions they're not members of.
This was directly copied by Special:Random, but you are right.
This was not possible updated to use the proper state variable...
This whole last block from line 187 to 191 could be simplified to return skipIfLastMatched != null && skipIfLastMatched && cache.lastMatched;
This will add an new <input name="ajax"> everytime I change the switch. Please add the code to make sure only one is appended.
This will always be nil, right? As above, I think you can remove this argument.
This will cause a double free. The previous GF_REF_PUT() will already call auth_cache_entry_free() (where entry is free'd) if auth_cache_add() has failed.
this will cause the MKFSOPT to skip --mkfsoptions string if MKFSOPT is empty and MDSJOURNAL_SIZE=xxx
this will never be true if it's of type unsigned int.
This works. :) Still, I think it might be nicer to do the check and call the error page from showBannerEditor(), since that's the method that mostly deals with output. This method just returns an array for form generation, and may be called more than once in a single request.
This xdata is the response dict, I think you need to use xdata which is received in marker_rename
this-> typedef "char" named concept. hard coded "0"
Those variables are used by everyone deriving from GerritCommand. It should be pushed up as well and the getter/setters
ThreadIdType numberOfThreads = this->GetNumberOfThreadsUsed();
title.getPrefixedDb() gives the target article title, but in the apply() function it's looked up by href, which may be a redirect title.
To address the previous concerns about constructing a massive QByteArray in the case of no terminating character: I set pos2 to pos so that the QByteArray is empty in that case.
to forget too.. Specific code for containers 1 and 2 edit parts
Trying to swap the layout when obj1 == obj2 should just "return 0" (i.e. be no-op). There should also be a check that the two objects have the same uid and gid, and that the UID doing the swap is either owner or has mdd_capable(uc, CAP_FOWNER) since this would ensure the process isn't trying to steal data (i.e. the process doing this could read and overwrite the data if it wanted).
TTo be more complete, check for funcService != null first (or use an optional?)
u mentioned that is "good to have". i will try to convert tests for distribute volume.
Understood. To me it would have been safer to keep the chain as is, but introduce the validation check explicitly, but if you think this is okay too, then I'll shut up.
Unfortunately, I don't think so, since it probably contains the version of the metamodel which varies over time...
Unnecessary field if sshdAddress is used consistently.
Unnecessary now with no inheritance.
unrelated, but 'children and whose children' ain't english ;)
unused parameter 'p_info' [-Werror=unused-parameter] (p_info ? -> pinfo ?)
unused parameter 'p_info' [-Werror=unused-parameter] (p_info ? -> pinfo ?)

Update: Tried to make the unary member operators, but apparently even gtest requires binary comparison operators to work on objects, so I'll have to abandon that.
Use a proper sentence, and this routine does more than that, returning encoded version.
Use existing $GLOBALS['LANG']->sL('LLL:EXT:lang/locallang_core.xml:show_item.php.uid') with "Uid:" ?
use functionDecl->getLocation() instead of functionDecl->getSourceRange().getBegin(), so the caret is nicely positioned under the start of the function name
use macro VKEY_FEATURES_INODE_QUOTA and VKEY_FEATURES_QUOTA
use mock.patch.object, also should be able to use the decorator like on the other method.
Use spaces, rather than tabs, here, for consistency.
Use tvb_ip_to_str. That should eliminate the need for arpa/inet.h
Using a direct english string here means it can't be translated :-( You can do a grep for e.g. RID_SVXSTR_LOAD_ERROR for a sample trivial translatable string example you can follow to get a translatable string here
using ANY_DIFF has a huge impact on performance, typically there are many thousands of unchanged objects and only a few changed, with ANY_DIFF filter you will only traverse the changed objects otherwise all of them
Using itkAssertInDebugAndIgnoreInReleaseMacro for efficiency.
Using the . seems to be the preferred way of doing this and orca screenreader does not read out the fullstop so that is good
valign is still spread a lot across the core - this will be a seperate task to clean this up. this makes it only more easy to find.
Value stored to 'offset' is never read (Clang Analyzer)
Various tests won't link if I leave the macros out. F.e. tst_qpropertyanimation, tst_qitemmodel, tst_qsettings, ...
warn: ll_setattr_raw():we tested 'rc' before and it was 'false'
warn: lnet_ping():check that 'tmpid' doesn't leak information (struct has a hole after 'pid')
warn: lov_unpackmd():variable dereferenced before check 'lmm' (see line 392)
Warned about same in doc string. It'd be more safe to remove this method altogether.
WARNING: Code after RETURN statement cannot be executed
Wasn't the trailing slash already removed when the GitHub URL was read from the config?
We also need to check the return value from wal_commit as well.
We backed away from that. It is simply impractical. Too many tools and users use refs/for/ to remove support for it.
we can actually allocate a 4K buffer which would be bigger enough to store the message.
we can add at the end the following args "--" "-j8" but that won't work for windows. Moreover we need to provide the generator. I was lucky enough that the system was picking the last one that I used. So we might need to stick with a CMake call that configure the pom for you. So maybe for external build tree, that tree should probably became the place where maven should be run instead of the Maven source dir.
We can address it in a separate commit, but I rather use only one approach for the compaction instead of having a sorted compaction as an option. Sorting will be expensive especially when we have a large number of items. If we don't have not much performance gain, I rather use an unsorted option.
We can go back and change this to the char* version if it gets too difficult to figure out what's going on.
We certainly can use the errno here as we are invoking'fork'
We do realize that the given glfd pointer, could now have been reallocated and hence pass all these checks still and crash, right? just checking :) Ideally if we want to validate that this is a good pointer, which we sort of cannot unless we have a table of valid pointers and check against that etc. or hand out numbers and map that into a table.
We don't need this line any more. Or we could keep this here and use it instead of calling parseInt in the five instances below.
We don't need to drop the function as it will be dropped in the function db_create_trigger()
we have audio_data_file and so this can be changed to that.
We have that around many classes this way now. If I recall correctly we have not guideline for this. Would you be fine with keeping it this way? If so, please merge.
We ironed out the issues on bug 49965, a few patches are linked from it.
We kept this in r46 to keep some minor behaviour consistent. By omitting this in r50, we are actually keeping the behaviour of rc and final consistent, modulo the bug fix - see this function in git diff 53fc9d0 -- src/gromacs/mdlib/coupling.c. Since the r50 tests are already generated with the new RNG, we should expect those tests to continue to pass.
We kind of discussed this last time - and thought that we didn't want to fail any calls if the operators were not recognised..
we might want to support Z here, since that's coming in a day or two
we must make sure the paste file is in absolute path mode: config_path = os.path.abspath(config_path) ?
We need refresh freq_demote = defrag->tier_demote_frequency; here, otherwise we won't be able to change the frequency from the CLI.
We need to enter in this IF block only in case of unknown protocol, so when dissector_try_heuristic() return value is 0.
we need to test both non-privileged "udp4" and privileged "ip4" sockets here.
We only move bonds to the same place or back. So bond j is always tested. In the extreme case there are no H-bonds and the loop is simply a copy from i to j=i. Also note that this code has been tested in the nbnxn_hybrid_acc branch.
We probably should ensure the project is clean before doing this, otherwise a user might lose uncommitted changes they care about: project = Project( manifest = self.manifest, name = path, remote = RemoteSpec('origin'), gitdir = os.path.join(self.manifest.topdir, path, '.git'), worktree = os.path.join(self.manifest.topdir, path), relpath = path, revision = 'HEAD') if project.IsDirty: print >>sys.stderr, 'error: cannot remove %s: uncommitted changes are present' % project.relpath print >>sys.stderr, ' commit changes, then run sync again' else: shutil.rmtree(project.worktree)
We probably want tvb_reported_length_remaining() here
We probably want tvb_reported_length_remaining() here
We should have a log for non-connect events as well, probably at trace or debug levels.
We should move this to some other module since it has very little to do with SIMD, and it was only a hack for a single architecture. However, that will require us to write a different hardware module, so for now I've added a define for GMX_SIMD when any of the SIMD architectures is enabled (which is good to have anyway).
We should not reset the current filter here, but still need to use it for incoming read operations, and then replace it with the new filter in an atomic way below.
We should rename this method to "artefact_title_for_view_and_block()". Because what it really does is tell you if the artefact has an alternate title when viewed in a specific View & Block.
We shouldn't need ${ITK_EXECUTABLE_PATH} at all. Just naming the executable target will work because add_test(NAME) knows to translate a target name appearing just after COMMAND into the right path. This is already done for the other tests.
We take an "error_list" from the framework here, but "message" is passed as an argument. Looking at how message is constructed, this also could be generated here (there is no need to pass it through argument). So either both message and error_list are this function arguments, or none of them.
We tried to avoid include the large block in #if ... #else... #endif. :). And does this change break MIPS? Our change will not impact MIPS.
we will need to log the error since it is ignored by caller
We would prefer to keep this. It is possible for the RILD and radio code to pass the sequence number through into radio state as the request is being acted on - the RILD may notice the socket error and re-establish the connection and then the response comes back from the radio with the old sequence number and get's passed back through the newly-connected RILD. Just because your implementation may not do this, we can imagine other OEMs passing back obsolete responses that would match a newly-zero'd RIL sequence number and confuse things. Couldn't you just remember the first sequence number your RILD connection received? Then you know the number of requests you've received.
Well - these files are still generated by autogen.sh, if no autogen.input is present. And when I asked on IRC, people told me they are still used. Actually I was told to keep the minimized info message to move config from autogen.lastrun.bak to autogen.input, instead of some more prominent header. I actually don't see a reason to deprecate the configuration via autogen.sh commandline arguments. For me autogen.input is just an other way to configure stuff.
Well I need a way to tell whether the newestConfiguration is enabled, since the 0 returned by defaultConfiguration() does not mean that, instead it means there are no configurations at all. How else do you suggest I could expose it?
well, at least not visually :p the following section is in the same green box, unlike other style guides that put it in a red box: "# Section of discouraged cases"
well, since we're doing this, might as well do this instead, since it's cleaner and looks better (and sanitized). elements = getattr(self._conn, class_name)(ElementName=element_name) data = self._get_first_item(elements) And before you dismiss the usage of getattr, That's actually how wmi namespaces work: the __getattr__ method is overriden and it will lookup and cache that class_name and return it, as it does not have it defined. This way it is more flexible, same wmi module works for any namespace.
Well, this is still a parameter, so you should probably leave the line.
What about abstracting this even further: instead of requiring a region_device to describe the location, we could just accept the name of an FMAP region and look up its offset and size.
what about Jigal's comment "Copying an array for the sake of a variable name is a waste of resources IMO." ?
What about setting tv->arg = arg and remove g_free(arg)?
what about this case? if user selected sysprep/cloud init in run once (then we get here) but also have payload configured?
What about: "Get the original length of the packet (may be larger than the captured length if the snaplen (dumpcap -s) is in effect)" (or something that clarifies the relation)
What do you think about my last paragraph? Do you think it's really needed to have a parseDevMode and parseProdMode methods?
What happen if groups were imported to an institution different from 'mahara'?
What happen when you pass the same email and ask to delete it and set as preferred? Make it sense to check for this and reject this case as mutually exclusive options?
What happens if a leap2a import's $entry->summary doesn't have any children at the path div->div? Should we check to see if the $entry->summary->div->div->children() exist and fall back to $entry->summary if they don't?
What happens if match is missing or empty? Does it do something sensible when trying to match against an empty pattern, or should such commentlink rules be skipped (e.g., with a 'continue;' statement here)?
What happens if the specified branch doesn't exist? Will that be caught by the check at line 154?
What happens if this fails? How do we ensure ssh is killed? Maybe a trap would be more supportable?
what happens if this fails? You have already deleted at the backend...
what is the reason for having them private? I mean I usually like private stuff, but it's uncommon in TYPO3 CMS ;-)
what means "error_expected" = "create". It's means there are nor error? then it's better to use None by default for self.input.param("error-expected", None) and you set string in error_expected by default value is boolean. python allows it but it's not good to change the type of variable
What status is the best here? I cannot use status from the current response here, also I don't know status of the other responses here.
Whatever's easiest for you is OK with me :) Another CL would be easier for reviewing I suppose but if you would rather throw it in here, or create the class now and make another CL later to convert other existing code, I'm fine with that as well.
What's the correct thing for things exec'd from init? I assume we can use logwrapper if we need to.
What's the error message? and is that with the latest transform change?
what's the purpose of this change? do we really need this in the patch?
when i was suggesting flipping the boolean, i did also wonder whether we wouldn't be better off just passing in the length. if it's <= 0, interpret that as "don't know"? that would then move 8192 down out of the callers too. or... i really like the way you went for readFully rather than implementing the missing read()s, which is what i'd actually imagined. how about we go one further and just have a static fromFile or similar? then it could do the stat, and have everything it needs. you could even use Libcore.os open/fstat/read/close to avoid the RandomAccessFile without increasing the overall amount of code.
When using this many parameters, using named parameters is preferable to make things more clear
When you move a host to maintenance then that calls disconnectStorageServer which should remove this definition so in general this shouldn't affect anything negatively. The case where this would remain is in case of an error flow where for some reason it wasn't disconnected properly or something. Even if that happens, it's not that interesting as a few leftover connections shouldn't affect the host negatively (think about FC where the host is always connected). The advantage is that most of the time (since hosts don't move between DCs very often) the host would automatically reconnect whenever it reboots (e.g. due to sanlock fencing) and it would be available to engine almost immediately reducing recovery time. Imo that is more important. See oVirt Bug 881941 - After a reboot of both engine and vdsm domains take a long time (15 minutes) to recover
When you swap a KEY_RIGHT for a KEY_LEFT in RTL, that's because you're interested in the "start of the line" (which is on the left in LTR) rather than the left vs. right; so in the "case KEY_LEFT", the comment could say "start of the line, no special RTL handling".
where do these section come from - the linker feeling clever?
Where do we handle the COMPILER_RT_rmodules_$(4) ? Is that just included in the objs ?
where size is not the issue, and performance is not a big deal like in test, please use range() to mainatain future compat with python3
Which comment? :) Good idea. I'll update to explicitly call out CANARY_MASTER. It doesn't work b/c Initialize is mocked out in the sync_stage unit test, so self.repo never gets initialized and is None in the conditional logic. Haven't looked too far into why it's not being triggered for 'master-release', but I suspect that config simply doesn't run this unit test.
Which tarball do you mean here? I don't see why installing the file would matter for the source tarball, which is the only thing we are currently interested in. I tested, and the INSTALL file ends up in the source tarball just fine even without this block (but with the other changes here).
While we're changing the names of these triggers, let's fix the spelling of the word "exceed" as well. I think "unmark_quota_exceed_upd_set" should still be short enough.
while you're at it, would it make sense to fill in the remaining cases? Desktop, Music, Movies, Pictures, etc... the implementations which can be supported using a virtual file system (i.e. media types, as long as the permission is set in the manifest) can be added later, but having the cases here already seems reasonable
Whitespace matters. We use tabs, and trailing whitespace has to be removed.
who uses this method ? I don't see why this is useful. I'd just get rid of this method and the associated field. Once you do that, you can just collapse this class into a single static method (runAll) and get rid of the Pair class.
whoops, this is not new code, but docs are always good!
whose bugfix? what is the bug number? the comment is as helpful as it could be :) if there is a fix for this but not enough time to test best to let future programmer know where to look
Why an extra header file? The definitions can go directly to settings.cxx
Why are we allowing calls to non-existent functions?
why are you going to manager function if glusterd_svc_check_volfile_identical function will failed ??? you should simply return error.
why are you going to manager function if glusterd_svc_check_volfile_identical function will failed ??? you should simply return error. same comments apply for all reconfigure function if you have done same things.
Why are you using cerr here instead of vtkErrorMacro?
Why call it GetStartIndices() instead of the expected "GetSeeds()" ?
Why can't this go int QTypeinfo? (i would like to have it there to enable some feature of QWeakPointer only for QObject for example)
Why checking for null pointer here? delete handles null pointers just fine, you only add overhead here.
Why define this as a new function instead of replacing the one that expects a NamedElement? getFuncName is invoked on actions, but also on guards, and we need to apply the new naming on guards as well. If we replace the old getFuncName with this one, but keeping the NamedElement parameter, we can move the "translator.getSource" part here and be able to reuse the same function without modifying the ActionDeclarationGenerator or the GuardDeclarationGenerator.
Why did you add this back? It's not needed as far as I know.
Why did you make this change? I think it makes sense to have the assertion.
why do we json_encode() $scopeData here? We do not do this in the base class. Furthermore it is already serialized. The only difference in this method compared to the one in the base class is now the Tree.thisScript stuff. The question therefore is: Is this a bug in the baseclass that Tree.thisScript is not set, or is it superfluous here? If neither applies, then still the question remains, if there's a nicer way of adding this code snippet without overriding (and copyiing) the complete method from the base class?
Why do you set the value to true for the requiresAuthentication here since it is already set when you create the class !
Why is 1 the default? Why isn't the default to use all available cores? This is the default for mdrun and also the default behavior of OpenMP.
Why is this rounding necessary? Just a guess, clock skew?
why not arm? I am thinking about removing this ifndef...
Why not do dict_get_str and use the ptr to find the index. That will avoid more book keeping
Why not just adjust the check upstairs to (m->total_size?:2048) > (microcode_end - (u32)c) then you won't need this check if you assume that cbfs is correct and if you don't cbfs check belongs to cbfs functions, not here.
Why not level 1? We don't care about warnings in third-party code. Using level 3 could actually *increase* the level depending on the actual build flags.
Why not move this up into the anonymous namespace above? It is harder to read going from RWMolecule constructor/destructor to internal class and back again. Maybe I missed something subtle? If so, maybe we could add a brief comment.
Why not put this in begin(), so that all subclasses will have the trxFname logic?
Why not simply do: connect(groupSeparatorChkBox, SIGNAL(toggled(bool)), groupSeparatorSpinBox, SLOT(setGroupSeparatorShown(bool))); ?
Why not to include topic when this really implemented?
Why not use: if ($limit > 0) { } elseif ($limit < 0) { }
Why this special case? It did not exist before and all it callers seem to take it from a tvb (except for a hard-coded 2000 in EnhancedAlarmMessage, which seems wrong too as the length is not checked there?)
Why would you remove it ? Please keep gid_File_Bin_UnpackUpdate untouched.
why? this makes no sense. you should have just amended it if you didn't want to wait for the roundtrip.
why? we removed prelinking for a very specific reason (security), and I don't think we want to put it back in the platform.
Will take a look after we decide how to move forward.
Will the servicename have other characters at this point?
Will we miss adding the server if the status change command failed on it? I guess we should add it if it fails with "already enabled" error. Not sure what we should do if there is some other error though. Maybe we should let the sync job handle such cases.
With auto-generated CRUD methods you don't need to define these methods manually. Please check this patch https://review.openstack.org/#/c/62865/
With ElementTree I can create an Element and provide the attributes as a dict see implementation below it's much easier, minidom is too much limited http://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.dom.minidom.html
with proto_tree_add_item, last argument is encoding no value
with the suggested while loop this would become i =0
with --xml, return code will be zero for both success and failures. This may fail for invalid Volume name.
Wondering if this message could be more descriptive in terms of specifying WHAT remote operation failed?
Wondering whether ret needs to be initialised to -ENOMEM here because its caller is expecting it to contain -errno.
Woops! Sorry. I'll fix this in the upstream (well, it's my upstream after all) and add a patch to the queue to update the library.
Would be better to name this view rather than window
Would it be worth putting `-ex` here to get the echoed output and exit status?
Would it be worth to mention that the review notes are written by the review-notes plugin?
Would it make it easier to override if we return a List? That way if someone wants to add an adapter, they could simply add to the list instead of copying the array. This method is used in an enhanced for loop, so a list would work just as well as an Array
wouldn't this be subject to the same bug if the server answers something different for one of the keys, like 0x86 TEMP_FAIL? what about doing a response.Read while it's not returning -1 (socket.isAlive == false)? the NOOP already returns from the loop, but the case where correlationId doesn't map to a key should maybe also be a break from the loop, not a continue?
xport entries are added to the conf->xprt_list under the "conf->mutex", but not client entries. "xprt" entries are added to the list during handshake I suppose in server_rpc_notify(). Post that , in "server_setvolume()", we create client entry and assign it to transport object "xprt". So there could be scenarios where in we have an entry in xprt_list without client associated.
Yeah -- I just left a related question on the rename CL :) Lets discuss this IRL.
Yeah, but this is usual wording we are using: $ git grep "member of the privileged 'Administrators' group" | wc -l 20
Yeah, done. Removed the function and function calls. Thanks.
Yeah, I used that in other places. You're right it doesn't make much of a difference: no difference for norm and about 20% or 20k for the language tables. I've simplified the code and also now use NewFormattedFileWriter in all the other places where I'm used go/format before. See the diff of language/table.go to see how it is affected (will first do the IANA update separately). Unfortunately, this increases the diff a lot. Again in language/tables.go. But you can verify the data itself didn't change by looking at the checksum at the bottom.
yeah, if it's fatal, we might as well just revert the serial patch. The whole purpose of the serial (or ehci-debug) route is for platforms that don't support (for whatever reason) cbmem console log. If it's fatal here, then the script won't run on those platforms, making it impossible to collect the logs with this script. I'm not going to fight it anymore though.
yeah, just wondered how likely that would be in combination with OStringBuffer?
Yeah, major documentation work in the next few weeks, so we can all use our time more efficiently when new or wasn't-paying-attention-then developers come on board. Today, only worried about completing the rc while not creating repeat work later! :-)
Yeah, we can file a bug against android or just fix it and submit a patch.
yeah.. that being said, the protocol explicitly state it to be two bytes ;-)
Yep, I've merged the two into |supportedSignatureAlgorithms|.
Yep, not sure why it was using a string there. Thanks.
Yes they are. Most of the shorter methods are from Media Foundation SDK example.
Yes, and it does. I submitted an amendment with a better comment explaining that.
Yes, assuming the modelService works :) This private method does not rely on other services. Also, model service may have issues with elements that have the same ID. In theory I could put the same element with the same id multiple times in a menu. I don't know if modelService would be able to resolve that. At least here we can count and validate if need be. I will make the other changes and await response on this.
yes, I know see you have fixed almost all places. thanks.
Yes, it is a bug in adb, no ambiguity here, but it's really subtle, so it'd be nice to have a better description of the problem, it's not really Python specific as you mention, i.e. something like: """ Some programs want to launch an adb command and collect its output by calling CreateProcess with inheritable stdout/stderr handles, then using read() to get its output. When this happens, the stdout/stderr handles passed to the adb client process will also be inheritable. When starting the adb server here, care must be taken to reset them to non-inheritable. Otherwise, something bad happens: even if the adb command completes, the calling process is stuck while read()-ing from the stdout/stderr descriptors, because they're connected to corresponding handles in the adb server process (even if the latter never uses/writes to them). """ The PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST isn't directly related to the problem, and not needed in this specific case because I don't think there are multiple threads being used in the adb client process (at least when reaching this code). It's probably better to avoid mentioning it, or add a note like "ideally, use PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST if running on Vista or higher"
Yes, let's improve documentation. Thanks for comments.
Yes, sorry about missing the indirection. Here's the example. 0xffc00000 -- 0xffe00000 cbfs in memory. 0xffdffffc has 0xffdfffa0 in it which would then be passed back to map.
yes, that's the point: if it's a *designer* plugin, it needs to depend on designer, as in the other example. but this is a ui loader/widget plugin only.
Yes, this is correct! The error was introduced by bbc94edb9a91b27910d43610db9994df10dd99e1
Yes, you are right, although I do not believe we ever did ;) I'll change it back.
Yes. Actually, look at what I just merged to master with the query operators, in particular you might want to read the documentation in user-search.txt. You can write a query to identify changes that can be submitted: is:open CodeReview+2 Verified+1 -Verified-1 -CodeReview-2 If we put that string (minus the is:open part that would be implied) into your field, it means what you want it to mean... you can submit this only if the above expression is true. By making it a single string, all you need to do is feed the string from the table through the ChangeQueryBuilder to get a Predicate<ChangeData>, and then run match() on that to see if the submit is possible. That completely removes the FunctionState mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time. So the existence of that ChangeQueryBuilder and its Predicate support classes is why I was trying to steer you into a simple string here. We have the code already done to handle that as a string, and users can use the same syntax to search for changes as they can for controlling how we manage them.
Yhis could be removed and use as parameter of the reset method.
Yikes, we are starting an RPC for every row in the table? My concern with this is the browser can only issue 4 requests at a time to the server. If a user has 50 items in their dashboard, which many do, this will take quite a few round-trips (13!) to completely load the status codes. Worse, if the user navigates away before they are completely done loading, they will continue to load, as there is no way to cancel the queued RPCs. I would prefer having myApprovals and strongestApprovals take a Set<Change.Id> and return a Map<Change.Id, Whatever>, and make only one call to each method for the dashboard.
York, please use TAB in each line following the coreboot coding standard.
You are missing Schema upgrade and SchemaVersion. See for example this change [1]. [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/56641
You are missing usage = "List of SSH session ids to be closed" or some such.
You are mixing two different use cases. Use case 1: beginTransaction() commit() this works, because beginTransaction() set autoCommit=false and commit is successful even though nothing to commit. Use case 2: open Connection with autoCommit=true commit() Evidently, this doesn't work on all Jdbc dialects supported by Gerrit. E. g. this doesn't work on PostgreSQL for the same reason why rollback() doesn't work. To see the failure, remove this if-guard above and run PostgreSQL unit test: testRollbackNoTransaction() it is failing with: Cannot commit when autoCommit is enabled. or some such.
You are right, this won't work without the next patch (use DbGroup instead of LdapGroup), I will check again and I will probably have to merge both this patch and next one into one single patch.
You assume here that size of phdr entry is sizeof (*phdr). You should use phentsize instead.
You ca use directly val_to_str on HF VALS(xip_serval_proto_vals...)
You can actually remove this entirely - I needed it to work around a bug in lcb when connecting to a non-standard port (i.e. ./cluster_run running on port 9000 instead of 8091). For use in perfrunner with standard packages we probably want CCCP.
You can add bitmasks to the hf_ item and still use proto_tree_add_item to get your desired effect.
You can open as many issue tickets as you like. But we would still have to add all these tests in here, and find solution that fit them. Why delay?
You can pass in -ret as errno to gf_msg. Also, this can be a new msgid : DHT_MSG_OPEN_FD_ON_DST_FAILED
you can remove the access tag and set the function actually to private
You can remove these functions now and use logcat_text_dump_open in dump routines in file_access.c
You can simply use here $GLOBALS['TYPO3_LOADED_EXT'] It is initialized in the bootstrap. Basically this global does not need initialization. And extension could still use it in ext_tables and ext_localconf.
You cannot design an API for logging. We should take out the "command" argument and have generic errors. It's easy looking at vdsm.log to discover what was the command executed before this failure.
You can't make changes directly to OOJS directly here. You need to check out the oojs repos (gerrit.wikimedia.org:29418/oojs/core.git & gerrit.wikimedia.org:29418/oojs/ui.gt), make changes there, and once they are merged create a separate change which updates this concatenated file. Then you can rebase onto that change.
You could eventually create 1 hf entry per size. For sizes <=32 bits, you can use the same filter name. But for those above 32 bits, you need another filter name (as seen in README.dissector chapter 1.5.1)
you could use `self.patchobject` from HeatTestCase, that does all the boilerplate for you. Or use @mock.patch.object as class decorator, as you seem to use this mock in all tests.
You don't need to put this xml or a new test class. That means in a previous test case you can just do following: @WithProperties({ @Property(name = "webApiUsage", value = "resistance") }) public void testAnimationImpInResistanceMode() { // your test code here }
you handle all these exceptions in the same way so you can use multi-catch: } catch (RevisionSyntaxException | AmbiguousObjectException | IncorrectObjectTypeException | IOException e) {
You have a potential problem here with MMCONF_SUPPORT. This option indicates hardware has PCI-e config register access in MMIO space in addition to the legacy 0xcf8/0xcfc IO registers. A second option MMCONF_SUPPORT_DEFAULT is not set, so by default you would use PCI IO config access. But since those are non-atomic, SMI handler in i82801ix explicitly uses MMIO and you have no MMCONF_BASE_ADDRESS set.
you have create_port function with build in cleanup, it's better to use it
You may want to check for NULL because cbmem allocations can fail.
you might be used to americanisms here. they can be awful sometimes. They right things "like this." it's garbage ;)
You might even want to change (de)allocations in this source to use gf_*() routines (as a part of this patch or separately).
You might want to use a constant ScriptRunner.NOP instead.
You need to do error detection etc.. Perhaps its easier to just build up a single buffer, and then call a single function to write everything to disk so that you have a single place to add file IO error detection (and logging).
You only need assertTrue(Object.class instanceof Type); The rest will break GWT test for the cases where there is no metadata available.
You probably meant that the comments should explain why, not how? But even that is missing here.
You probably need to check for divide-by-zero here, since addr_len comes from compr, which is based on packet data.
You removed this line in I1c2a5a9c3da5 with a commit message that noted you wanted COM removal only in the second half of VV, but there was no related change to how that worked. How do we assess when you were right? :-D
You should put it into memcached_defaults instead. That handles the upgrade scenario and will allow us to change the value easily in future.
You should use a different filter name as you cannot mix FT_UINT64 (hf_glusterfs_size64) and FT_UINT32 (hf_glusterfs_size). See doc/README.dissector chapter 1.5.1.
You should wrap the following code into a try/finally and close the pdb when you are done with it.
You shouldn't check "_doc.length.bodylen == 0 && (iterator->opt & FDB_ITR_NO_DELETES)" again because we already checked it above.
You shouldn't need this - I have a patch in flight to our gtest - see https://github.com/daverigby/gtest/tree/clang_analyzer which will make the GTest asset macros "understood" by clang analyser.
You'll get bool to int conversion warnings with these return calls.Fix by return this-> ...()? 1 : 0;
you'll need someone with some maven experience to review this
Your memory is too smalll. Consider buying a RAM. :D
You're preforming this check multiple times. it's better to create a separate function, in case we will need to add a new "localhost" name/ip
You're right. Ivan,tenant_id is non-admin tenant need to change to admin tennt id here. will fix it in next patch.
You're right. The issue is that the onSampleSelected() callback uses the Combo index to fetch the sample from mSamplePath, so the way you have it they don't match (if you try, selecting a sample will load a different one). The trivial solution is to sort mSamplePaths alphabetically like it should have been done in the first place anyway (my fault for forgetting that).
guys... this is so stupid...
I lost the whole morning cause HBase's RegionServer was dying with no logs no nothing... how Am I supposed to debug the issue if u do not even generate a core dump?
{quote}You are messing down deep below hbase in dfs.
And I think if we're going to do a sweep up of shit we should just kill root.
idiot Yeah I was on that idiot-path for a good while but commons-lang is a hairball at least where this hashcode making and equals is concerned.
Pull it back in if you think different.
i suck.
Will still be stuck in the loop though if can't actually close regions.
Original edited patch was messed up... stupid sed!
Who made this stupid rule?
Sorry but this is just stupid.
But I will quit committing to Hama then because I'm not going to support ONLY a binary format.
This is not what I build a framework for.
Well damn.
Blooper after blooper - I hate SVN.
This looks reasonable to me... sucks we have to special case handling of " "...
You may want to carefully examine your assumption about this.
Ok wow welcome to Linux hell...
If I get a chance I may even roll it into our dev environment but I am currently in the middle of mem leak hell.
Both equally bad.
Negative I am against fetch groups in principle.
This way lies metadata hell.
Shit there is an dependency. Please go to Preferences -> LDAP -> Entry Editor and enable the option "Show operational attributes".
Damn...
Damn...
Damn !
The evil NPE strik back !!
Bloody hell !!!
Damn time has flown...
Damn it !
This was a very bad bug introduced by me being an idiot.
I have stupidly deleted the original test dir but judging from the suite's output files no output was created after 3 1/2 hours.
damn this was assigned to you since months.
Imo all this just doesn't make sense from a pure performance aspect.
Inserting timestamps automagically would be bad because it would limit a whole swath of use cases.
If they do then Suse's cpio works for old ascii but the -c switch is broken.
This is pretty embarassing!
When you install a node module globally it goes into /usr/local where you don't have permissions to move shit into unless you sudo.
That being said I'm not totally opposed to making the limit configurable.
My bad I screwed up the assertion -> RuntimeException transition.
Well that sucks.
No it's not off the table but it's moot unless we decide we want cqlsh in-tree at all.
Ok here is a patch that works. I was stupid enough not to see it...
It was a pretty stupid idea to use a static array of instances for QuorumOpMonitor.
All I'm trying to say is that it's pretty easy to end up in propagation failure hell here or change something else that blows things up for use cases that are not foreseen.
Just to clarify... you made the DTPE handle exceptions the same way as CassandraDaemon by updating it to use NBHS instead of CSLS... Did you just tell me to go fuck myself?
+1 (damn intellij it's not like patch format hasn't been standard for years)
Wow it's like Thrift is going out of their way to make life suck for us this month.
Here is quite bad.
The samples you gave are different.
I just noticed your public tweet... bq. "wilhelmbierbaum True. Fuck the Avro C API."
if so can you see if you can git bisect this bad boy?
It seems some of the wrappers in ink_hrtime.h() might no longer be used either e.g. ink_gettimeofday() is never used so lets get rid of that shit.
Heh that's one hell of a bug 275 bytes exactly eh?
What a stupid name I chose for that object... )-:
I think it's time to just close this issue.
I'm not entering bogus reports for the hell of it ;) Matt

Stupid Maven
Ok. Stupid user Error here.
Why the hell do they deliver Duration if they cannot instantiate it :-/
The defect from hell 666 be scared..
This really sucks!
Why the hell is this not a bug?
What the hell are you waiting for ?
I suspect it has nothing to do with the file system connector or Infinispan connectors and is simply a (stupid) mistake in the federated join processor.
I'm an idiot.
It really sucks that there is now way currently to include transitive dependencies.
I'm an idiot... there's nothing wrong with the readme.txt.
Crap forgot to verify that this is inconsistant with MRI it's not.
Please close as this is just me being stupid.
Holy hell I think I found one problem with turning a bignum into anything else.
This sucks *so much*...
Damn I would close this out from the fix to JBSEAM-3742 except the quartz and seampay examples use a custom XML namespace and the XML schema validator is not happy with that.
*Damn* I forgot.
Also your username was stupidly named and confusing so I deleted it and created a new one more appropriate.
Damn it seemed it didn't work.
It sucks to lose the code readability but it seems like a reasonable price to pay.
I don't have to ensure that the classloader knows groovy classes *you* must do that.
And debugging is hell because the test environment needs to have the exact same loader setup.
who the hell starts using our jira for typing lessons ?!?
fuck u
Hell this is gonna take me a lot of work to raise.
That irritated the hell out of me too but I didn't realise it was configurable in the .launch file.
This sucks badly.
Why on earth does createLink() need a request?
Finally closing this bug from hell.
I sure as hell don't want to start attaching models for the sake of detaching them directly afterwards.
That sucks why isn't the escape mechanism working?
I am an idiot - this was a dupe of GUVNOR-84
Sun RI sucks why the hell is saveState() and restoreState() not called with with javax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD = server???
Swear to god I'm not a total idiot.
I don't know how the hell my diff program decided to add seemingly random CR chars but I've removed them now.
durrrh that sucks.
Im stuck with IE6 unfortunately.
What the hell I'll give this a shot.
{quote} searcher.getAtomicReader().getSortedDocValues(uniqueKey); {quote} This is a performance killer.
As far as the query shit i have no idea if solrdispatchfilter or whatever could/should do Thread.currentThread().setName(x) or whatever (and maybe restore after)
BTW: This is one reason why I hate this autoboxing shit since Java 5. I would love to have a way to prevent it in code (forbidden checks should detect this somehow).
Hmm that sucks.
tricky shit man! I think I found the issue!
Oh man ... it's a fucking precendence problem.
Ugh well that sucks.
I didn't know we needed to retain backwards config capability across 3.x to 4.x :-( That sucks and it'll make old code stick around longer.
bq. this is solr's fault by having a getter that does some heavy duty xml shit.
That sounds like some serious buck passing.
This whole thing is very distressing to me.
I think we all know it just sucks.
though I disagree with a signficant amount of statements you madeI don't think we would ever come to agreement anyway.
that's some freaky shit ...
I think you made mistakes in ivy.xml.
This is where it gets confusing.
If I can give you one advice on this one I'd say this: fuck Derby use H2 instead as the default embedded database.
What the hell?!
(Do nothing): Are you serious about that?
Oleg please accept that my "logical" is different from your "logical".
So I'm fine with your logic but given that I don't understand it please don't get upset when I ask questions on how I have to use it.
This was my bad.
The rest are *totally* unrelated.
Oh fuck :-) Sorry. Not my day more beer needed!
Sorry I guess I'm against "never computing this shit"... because you guys think returning NaN is ok.
if you want to make these optimizations fix the APIs so its intuitive otherwise no way.
who the fuck is asking for scores but not the max score and why does their insanely specialized use case justify all these booleans on a central lucene class.
I don't care about code duplication here.
We should not invoke the global synced fieldnumbers shit for every element only when the setting actually changes
I disagree... and I guess I'm willing to go to bat for this.
HOLY SHIT!
I think the comments here are a bad sign... I sent us down an unfortunate slippery slope we are a search engine library! don't put shit in the index directory! or we will delete your shit. dead simple.
I wholeheartedly agree this API is confusing as hell.
Not only it's the first one in my life I'm seeing multiple ways of closing the same thing it also conceals programming errors.
Sucks to rush a commit when an issue is under discussion.
I'm against such heavy committing myself without some consensus to do so.
I'm confused.
> I hated that aspect of working for commercial companies.
My bad.
My bad.
Igor is an idiot and we *do* need gmake.
Shit I missed a cast.
But even if it wasn't it would be totally worthless where it is at.
This is clearly bad webserver behaviour.
Forget what I made(D8067).
PreCommit-HDFS-Build is stuck.
So it is stuck somewhere.
I don't want one-offs like this to become lost and forgotten.
But now that I think about it it may crap out when coming back to read even on a recovered file.
Matt... I'm an idiot I used the wrong patch. Sigh.
I'm however very interested in this feature as it is essential to me.
bq. this is solr's fault by having a getter that does some heavy duty xml shit.
Holy complicated-as-shit-algorithm Batman! The complexity of our implementation vs the complexity of what we're actually doing is starting to worry me here.
It also happens at the very startup after he has loaded only 3 sstables (hence DataTracker likely have 3 sstables not a shit load).
Shit my bad. The posted patch is from a completely wrong branch of my git repo - I had not realized I ran the test-patch against a branch not branch0.
(In this particular case Hoss clearly intended to use the no-no word as an intensifier and not to stir shit.)
Maybe only one of us should play lawyer and the other one play engineer.
I used to be the latter but then I went to law school and got a degree in this shit.
Then to make matters worse since the mid0990's I've been offering pro bono advice to non-profit foundations whose members insult me regularly and assume I'm an amateur.
Someone but I'm not sure who owes me a public apology here. /Larry
Shit there is an dependency. Please go to Preferences -> LDAP -> Entry Editor and enable the option "Show operational attributes".
that's bad Content-Type from gSOAP.

Indeed that would be VERY bad design.

This is pretty trivial.
Of course it could... :-) DOH!
Then you're pretty well screwed.
Damn Chuck is scary.

Bad memory.

Of course StrFieldSource is a private class No it's not.
CSS is really confusing sometimes.
Django is a fullstack framework Click is not.
My bad.
Credit of course goes to Dick.
It seems really confusing.
+1 for this: my bad.
Hell or high water.
0 to jar hell.
That would suck.
If so a test that succeeds with errors is confusing as hell...
If the different segments are somewhat homogeneous then these stats should pretty much be very close anyway.
This is pretty trivial just adds three asserts to TestPath#testNormalize.
I doubt that Squid is so bad at it.
It's not too bad once CacheConfig is in.
Not too bad though since clearing out commitlog segments is easily done.
ah - my bad.

Damn maven!
I don't care if everything is pretty or not but we should at least support basic admin functionality in IE IMO (though I have not used it for years for just about anything).
I've looked at what can be done within the NSIS framework we use to build the Windows installer.
A feature with wrong functionality is as bad as if not worse than a bad performance.
Doh!
Doh.
Sounds weird to me... Could you package a (totally!)
Am I doing something stupid here?
* Replaced TreeMap with an Array of final 'Segment' objects ** (now very slightly faster than trunk) * Rebased for trunk * Removed the patch renaming SSTableReaderTest to SegmentedFileTest I didn't remove the builder pattern because the alternative seems pretty ugly (copying the segments array for every append).
HADOOP-2949: - If tarball is specified HOD no longer validates for the pkgs directory in gridservice-hdfs or mapred sections as these are not going to be used anyway.
It must be lost somewhere.
Too bad we can't use position:fixed in IE6.
I think the correct resolution is to ensure that the prefix stack mechanism gets reset each time the XMLReader is used.
This is always a really bad way to design software.
It may suck but at least *I* won't be the one bringing in a dumb dependency to a logging library.
How on earth is it buggy?
I didn't do that because that seems bad in hive so I returned "null" from the operation.

This name gets confusing with all of our prenamed *Worker* and *Master* classes.
* release of the framework.
I'm a pretty strong -0 on this.
Not pretty.
That's pretty unlikely.
Pretty much everything that FSNamesystem (ie.
Kind of sucks.
Since this patch is so damn large already I won't be making anymore changes to this other than critical/blocker bug fixes.
But please don't say that my reasoning is bad - because it is not.
> We can't let fear of back-compat prevent us from making progress.
I really don't care.
I am planning to use this framework for some new RPCs I am adding.
Don't hate me just throwing this out there.
Weird.
This is weird.
Gav...(Hoping I'm not teaching you how to suck eggs :) )
For those of us who don't care about ivy in fact lose something - a easy to build hbase.
Where on earth are you anyway?
My bad.
My bad this is already done.
That is bad.
Filling diags.log is bad mojo since it's never rotated.
How bad is it?
My bad.
My bad.
Bad IE.
Bad.
Pull it back in if you think different.
Stupid user error :)
Weird.
That's weird.
Actually I don't want to specify the encoding because I don't care how the data is transported to me.
And boy hell broke loose ;) So... the biggest issue I'm facing is indeed with Random sharing across threads.
I don't care what we do as long as we don't change the attributes in JSP significantly.
The Async API in http client 4.x really sucks.
Forget the patch for the moment.
I'll just put fix in under this issue.
Please forget last comment it is incorrect.
umm ... call me crazy but why are we making this public?
[~cmccabe]: oh hell no!
Damn...
I'd say to hell with windows minority :)
Because we don't care for this in cases where we there is no node that is down.
The eclipse ui was completly stuck which was similiar to the other experinces.
My bad.
Juhani..my bad i was mistaken.
My Bad.
That's my bad.
Seeking back is pretty inefficient in DFS.
Doh!
Hudson is stuck.
Weird.
Weird.
That's weird.
If that would be the case this would be bad design.
This just seems really evil.
It may cause conflicts but if your intent is to break system security you probably don't care.
My bad uploaded the wrong patch.
I just hate having no clue what a file is really depending on ;)
Ah damn I thought it was fixed :/ Guillaume ?
I abbreviated the heck out of my arguments and thinking but damn it thats what I think :)
A stupid bug in a patch that is already applied.
In this case data would pretty much just silently be lost.
This whole thing is really pretty trivial.
An output connector should also have a say in what URLs it will accept.
Turning off hints is basically intended as a "oh shit something is broken with hints let's turn it off" switch.
why on earth would it match anything you have not even touched the Apache install.
> - FOUserAgent.getStream() is cool and very easy to use (now that it's properly > documented).
i kinda like the black acctually .. but that may largely be due to my prefering the "fire" solr logo over the futuristic magnifying glass (the red/orange contrasts nicely with the black/grey. to my mind the "Solr" "Sun" connection has allways been really cool ...
Awesome discussion.
Got it thanks for the explanation.
The patch looks good.
Cool cool - thanks stack!
Awesome! This tool is cool.
Thanks guys for saving mankind!
This looks safe also
I've just tested the shiro trunk with karaf-2.2 release and everything works fine :)
Pretty sure this was fixed by the time we released JRuby 1.6.
Interesting I just replaced my src with the latest in the trunk and did a compleatly clean build and the problem seems to have gone away.
This is Awesome Stefan - thanks a million!
This is awesome - works in a one-liner.
Awesome!
Nice I did not think about using the system tables.
You're results are awesome Paul. Great work :) Looking forward to see your new JSON parser in trunk whenever you think is ready.
Awesome you rock Drew!
Very cool.
Awesome speedup! Finally all this work shows great results!!
Subbu: Glad I was able to help.
I believe in relativity :-)
Great! It's been good to be able to contribute and I hope to be able to more for this awesome project when I have the spare time.
Thanks Uwe!
Code looks cool.
Cool - good information to have. Thanks Lance!
Hey very cool.
Hi very cool!
I like the elegant parser!
Thanks for fixing it so quickly!
Jonathan: over to you :)
Cool looks good.
Cool. sounds good to me.
Hi Carlos This looks awesome! Lots of cool stuff.
Waaaaay cool! I especially like the "upload file" option.
cool stuff! a good candidate to put on myfaces-commons-utils so the user can just add the resource handler on its webapp faces-config.
Thanks Daryn!
Thanks for the reviews..
Wow thanks Raghu that's awesome and will save me a ton of time.
So very cool and so very committed-- thanks Matthias this is awesome.
Took me a few seconds to get it but then I realized how awesome it is.
I'm happy to use it as the standard logo (i.e. website etc.).
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=468444 Deepal Thanks!
Awesome stuff Stephen!
Thanks Alexei the patch is fine.
Awesome co-op. Thanks Robert & Mike for picking this up.
Cheers!
Thanks Galder:)
Daryn the current patch looks good.
Sounds good.
This is awesome!
v2 Looks good to me.
Hey you're right that idea was probably not the best approach to the problem - 0.6 looks really nice looking forward to it :)
Thanks for moving so quickly on this guys.
Thanks Sanjay!
Cool thanks Daniel we're actually cool with either updating it to e9ff8c4928 or flipping the write bit and we'll push the delta ourselves - whatever's the fastest to get to writeable:) Thanks --tim
This is a great suggestion.
great thanks Joel.
Thanks for reporting solved!
it belongs to faces 1.2 :)
Ok cool this is just a matter of adding strings to the various [NotFound()|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L160] returns in files.cpp There are a number of error cases in the [browse|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] and [read|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] endpoints I'd imagine one could change the javascript to generate bad requests which should be sufficient to test this :)
cool no worries.
Cool feature! Performance: - It looks like scripts are read from the resource loader and parsed again (eval) for every update request.
Thanks Ram That seems like a definite improvement.
Interesting that you decided not to detect the error based on finding two similarly-named operations.
It's OK.
Hi Suran The new catalogs_b.patch looks very good.
Nice feature lars!!
:) I've renamed ComponentColorProperty to be ComponentColorElement and RelationshipAggregation to TwistieAggregation.
Looks like this is fixed :)
Version 2.2.0RC3 is fine.
Sounds like a good idea.
Many thanks for your help.
Thank you!
I've tested them out and everything is fine.
Is that ok for this file (b/c I have no idea how to do the svn move now ... after I've made all the changes already) :)
Thanks once again.
bq. OK w/ the latest patch all tests pass for me! Great Awesome! :)
Great! Awesome! thanks Dims
Great! Awesome work Nick and thanks for the clarification Bill.
Great work...this is awesome stuff.
great. awesome job sergey!
Awesome - great stuff Maria. Thanks!

Thanks to both of you and to Deepesh for the initiative.
Cool.
Sounds like a good idea.
Cool that's all good news too! Thanks guys. One less on my radar.
cool man it looks good. we need a changes entry but from my side this looks good. we can tackle the todos on trunk
Looks pretty cool. Fresh and minimalist. Love it :-) Good work.
Cool will do! Thanks for the review and good questions... and the whole idea! :)
This looks good to me.
Automatic location selection is very cool.
Thanks Tony.
Thanks for providing the patch.

Super I'll commit shortly -- thanks Yonik!

Thanks [~cnauroth] & [~tomwhite] for the reviews!

Thanks Sijie.
Thank you for the patch Sergey.
I love a solution that's simpler and easier to understand than the original.
Hi Henry Thanks for checking it out.

Thanks Jing!
That sounds like a plan. I love peer-reviews... :-)

Thanks for your patience.
Thanks Ivan.
Hi Sandy Thanks so much to give me such comments that's really helpful I will update this later.
ahhh sweet i'm guessing you have an IDE that does this? If the tests pass commit this kinda crap goes out of date too fast!
I want to integrate the sweet sweet logo Andrew crafted.
Thanks Oliver!
Thanks to Fabrizio for the patch.
Regex is your friend.

It will be great if you could confirm it either way first.
Thanks Todd glad to be on board!
Sweet I will review and apply.
Thanks Amar!

Thanks for looking into this Suresh.
Thanks a lot for sharing that Josh!
Thanks a lot Subin.
Brilliant feedback thanks! I'm glad you found the issue and the solution!
Sweet :) You got there before me
bq. First of welcome :) Thank you.
Thats sweet that you have the prior experience hacking this on top of a store already.
Excellent work Doğacan - thank you.
This looks simple and sweet to me.
Sweet kickstart for our new wiki!
Hello Thanks a lot! It works. Lisa
Yes please - pull request away my friend!
If someone wants to take this over that's cool - I'm unlikely to have time in the next week and a half though.
It is a nasty bug that I've seen in real life though.
Yes exactly -- sorry to be so unclear.
I'm not sure what the problem is but the behavior (at least in 0.1.4) is that the _isClosed AtomicBoolean is not being set to closed in a timely manner.
Sorry for the delay and thanks for the good work works like a charm!
Sorry I thought submit patch was the way to attach a patch.
I don't have very much experience on branch0 would you like to take a shot at the port?
Especially I don't know very much about the test framework differences.
I will figure out the details and do the port later this week if you don't get to it first.
sorry unassigning myself from this backport.
Another backport (for a different jira) of mine is failing and I want to see if I can figure out what might be wrong there before doing a new backport.
To upgrade to a recent version of Jackrabbit see http://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/BackupAndMigration I'm afraid I can't say much about the risk.
I've tried something similar (I removed the handlers and kept the readers) but the performance was not visible.
The responder seemed to be a bottleneck.
But it was not the only issue: we also want to manage priorities between the tasks but we need to read them to get enough information to make the right priorities.
While creating the DerbyTest I did notice that this problem is caused by the Database pool because it tries to connect to the database in the background.
Sorry [~fiberlijun] - havent had a chance to look at it yet.
(I could not get what KEYWORD means.)
I am checking out the dojo fixes and patching them in sorry for the delay it has been a long time
> then we don't save IO by limiting the buffer size to 1 KB I'm confused by this.
Seems to be failing for a different reason now testContainerLaunch(org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.TestLinuxContainerExecutorWithMocks) Time elapsed: 0.523 sec <<< FAILURE!
Sorry for all the issue mails I forgot to mention the second: 2) There is commented source in the test should it be enabled or removed?
I'm very sorry.
Sorry guys... :( I was the reason for this trouble.
I should have been very careful before doing this.
My bad forgot to include the test file in the patch... Resubmitting in a second.
*sorry*
Damn.
Git is tricky that way.
Sigh I don't like this overall if can't reuse everywhere.
Sorry to let you lose a wild goose chase.
You are going to kill me when I say this but it seems like we should just commit your first patch.
This half-reuse is more confusing for new devs who see this code for the first time.
Sorry probably a misunderstanding from my side....
I meet the same problem on Eclipse recently but haven't figured out how to get through.
Sorry Chris I missed it done !
One of the error is that hiddenActivations cannot be resolved.
I'm very busy for the moment so I didn't know when I 'd be able to the change myself so if you can your contribution would be one more time really appreciated.
Oh I didn't consider one flow like after the edit log conversion immediately #store failed.
I misunderstood the case and sorry for the confusion.
Aside from the job succeeding (it doesn't) what effect should I be able to measure (in order to see if this is doing anything)?
You misunderstood the response: StopFilter indeed did not change.
You would need to implement session resume; thats a whole new can of worms.
Sorry for a mess in uploaded files my connection got broken during first upload.
Here are 2 patches ... one for adjustExamplePaths.bat & .sh and the other a new file holding 2 User Libraries ... UIMA_LIB & UIMA_AS_LIB Not sure where this should go ...
i found the class - so there is no bug - sorry
I was not aware of being required to call that method.
This is a silly one.
Seems we didn't enforce an exec for sh but we did for fs.
The patch should be relatively trivial but like I said I have no idea if there is other important stuff going on there or not.
Igor sorry it took me so long to get back to this.
Hey sorry I did not get back to you sooner.
I found the (sad) attempt at a script you asked about and uploaded it to MAPREDUCE-4282.
Sorry for the delay.
I don't have resources to hand to test this at mo.
Yes it is a dup thanks Mike for taking care of this (I planned to do this yesterday but didn't make it)
Forgot to add that I also tried this with and without HBASE-5864
but app developers should always explicitly set it based on their application My guess is that a large enough group of people take the defaults that it matters.
App developers never do what they should :)
problem - the bit to sign the source-release is being called when the source-release isn't being built because the source-release is only built at the "executionroot".
Excuse me for stolen assignement.
In current version the same error cause different messages because there are many commiters.
Sorry for the missing class src/java/org/apache/jdo/tck/lifecycle/StateTransitionsReturnedObjects.java.
Sorry if this was not clear and yes by <blank> I meant an empty string.
Qianshi is working on the SSL session reuse but this buggy Bug system does not allow him assign this ticket sigh
Hi Guillaume I did not have an answer right away so I sent you question to Leonard Rosenthol.
Sorry should have commented on this much sooner.
It is not yet tested - I ran into strange build problems with APR.
Done sorry for all the mess on a simple patch.
Secondly reading this code I can see why this bug is happening after completing stage 2 above when adding the new item the code does "ordered - cancelled = quantity" which equates to "1 - 1 = 0".
Keep repeating this and the problem just gets worse.
Please ignore attachment (id=6938).
It was attached to the wrong bug.
(back from holidays so a bit delayed but) I confirm Andrzej's suggestion -- a plain-text only summarized is ideal for clustering for example.
HTML is quite uncomfortable to work with.
Hi Marco I changed the name of patch because it was made in Java earliar sorry for inconvenience.
Sorry for the mistake.
Not sure I want the transient inability to clean up some local log or other trivial task to kill a whole pig job?
First guess: something's getting confused about reversed-ness.
Sorry I took Martin's comment to mean the patch was committed and issue closed which certainly discarded all the patches the first time around.
I don't know what just happened.
The patch went to the wrong bug.
Sorry again!
Our caller may not notice what happend right now.
Sorry for my poor review didn't notice try/catch :(
It does not look very useful.
Oh I'm sorry I was unclear.
Sorry Jacques I'll upload another file.
I did it wrong this time.
Sorry I had attached an older version... let's try this one.
However I figured it was better to get it in the public domain sooner and let the iterative process do it's work.
This is only a problem with exceptions from java.
Incidentally if we all nag Joe Walnes enough we might be able to persuade him to release a new qdox which can ignore annotations etc (though it will still struggle with generics I think)
Sorry I kind of forget about this one.
I don't have strong opinions about it either way.
Bugs like this make me sad.
SnappyCodec check for Hadoop native lib is wrong.
Sorry for the delay I'm recreating the mirror now.
Brandon sorry.
I misread.
Ignore comment.
Seems to be a faulty mailserver setup at laguna-industries.com.
Unfortunately in these days where everyone that can put a CD the right way up in a drive is a Linux/Unix/Windows/Internet Expert this has become pretty common.
And with a network that tolerates almost everything to get a mail somehow in the right place it is only seldom noticed (or when it is it is blamed on Microsoft.
Mac looks like the tests are failing (especially TestHarFileSystem).
Luke Sorry for the late attaching latest version patch
RMAppAttemptImpl.recoverAppAttemptTokens() Looks like all changes in RMAppImpl are unnecessary.
Bug in existing testDelegationTokenRestoredOnRMrestart().
Sorry we are no longer using Xerces.
That is a bit too lax I think.
The cause is that the call to SpecificResponder.writeError in Responder.respond ultimately calls GenericData.resolveUnion which in turn calls GenericData.getSchemaName before the line where the UnresolvedUnionException gets thrown.
I am new to Mina and the whole environment.
I have this issue where my server and client is creating a lot of loopback threads that I believe must be related to this issue.
Any word on whether it will be fixed?
I did not have time to do it yesterday.
Sorry for being confusing.
I am not really sure what does the receive payment do before the shipment it doesn't sound as if it is doing what we expect it to do.
Unable to reproduce issue.
Oh ok.
Sorry this affects 0.9.3 version too.
Phabricator is being a little buggy.
Tests no longer sleep
Sorry this should be YARN JIRA - filed YARN-350 instead
Sorry if this spam's things however it's unlikely that I'll work on these.
Forgot about these sorry.
Maurice I don't have such option or maybe I don't know where it is.
:) Sorry about that.
Sorry about the noise was trying out the precommit job.
Sorry about that...
Grumble grumble...
I was in too much of a hurry sorry hold on a sec.
Sorry I see that you say the same Mike :)
Sorry for the huge delay Fabio.
yup sorry just fixed.
I screwed up the encoding of the stopwords file (sorry).
So I also changed a test to test a non-ascii stopword :)
Sorry about the confusion before
Sorry.
Sorry folks the full fix was committed in rather a messy manner due to some platform specific issues.
Sorry didn't look at the code until commit... Can you test making it hash to a Long or a 8-byte ByteBuffer?
Sorry - the above comes across as terse.
I really don't know how to solve this problem.
If you know of a way please describe it.
Sorry.
Ha sorry Varun thanks for the reminder I will have a look at it soon...
Sorry.
Sorry for the wild goose chase!
Sorry db name is TPCDB user name TPC pwd whatever...
Sorry my code base is a little old looks like HADOOP-9147 add some new test in TestFileStatus.
I'm sorry.
Sorry; I hit close by accident.
Sorry I've been MIA on this issue.
I haven't had any time to try re-upgrading after having to back out 2.0.8 but I will be sure to let you know how it works out as soon as I get the opportunity.
Sorry for that.
Sorry missed that select-box.
Sorry for letting you guys wait.
[~shazron]Sorry that was weird.
Missed 2 new files - sorry !
Sorry no longer working on this
Sorry patch is attached
On 200800-20 11:43:52.354 woflexair commented: Joan sorry for the noise in the bugbase but it's not a bug.
Sorry once again for the wrong report Stephane
Sorry I forgot to change the priority of this one.
sorry.
Sorry that should have said fixed via HADOOP-4980 not 6980.
Sorry about the report.
Ugh sorry :( Thanks!
Sorry about that.
Sorry I didn't use your patch but I think you'll like the end result.
Some file were missing in the last patch sorry.
The biggest problem is that we've had too many committers over the years and we'd have to get all of their permission to change it.
So sorry I can't be more obliging.
Last try.
Sorry.
sorry.. redeploy patch
Sorry for the trouble Vikram!
Sorry for the misspelling ;)
(sorry if that was confusing)
sorry for your time.
I must have looked at this before my morning coffee..
Sorry ;-) +1
Wow that was some bad copy/paste work.
sorry.
sorry....
Sorry about that... http://bit.ly/12UiaS
Sorry Thiru I hope you haven't already started working on this!
huh ... i thought i did resolve this.
sorry.
Sorry misunderstood the issue!
Sorry for the delay.
sorry for delay
Sorry for the delay was away.
Sorry.
This was my bad.
Sorry it seems I forgot a few references to 2.0.2 in ./deps/cxf-all I'm attaching a new patch to fix these references.
Thanks Jukka for fixing this :) (sorry)
Sorry that should be FileChannel inputChannel = input.getChannel(); FileChannel outputChannel = output.getChannel(); in the try block.
Sorry [~svenkat] I just committed this.
No sorry.
Didn't got the time to try it yet.
Sorry to have not spotted this one and thanks for your care.
Sorry I missed the "overwrite" keyword.
This might be a bug indeed.
Sorry everyone.
sorry last patch was missing new files
sorry for misleading attachment name.
Sorry Avdhesh I forgot to add these two files to the patch here is the new patch containing the missing files
Hey Vikram-- sorry about that I haven't paid much attention to this issue.
Sorry should ask first.
Thanks to Mathias Werlitz - sorry for the delay.
Sorry.
The problems I was talking about are mostly fixed by [HADOOP-3575] and [HADOOP-3480].
I opened [HADOOP-3607] to fix a wrong URL but appart from that I don't there's still references to the old structure.
no sorry - priorities have been shifted around...
Um sorry i thought this ticket was about something else - patch attached David would you give a try?
Sorry for the noise.
Sorry about that.
Sorry I missed some of this the first time.
Sorry fixed.
Sorry Gav DONE Committed revision 2487.
Sorry but look at mapSubtract and further down in the source you will find plenty.
Sorry ;-)
Thanks for the report and sorry its taken so long to fix it.
well sorry i didn't upload the right files
Whoops sorry.
Sorry about the trouble.
Sorry in rushing to commit I forgot to add author during the commit.
Actually that's what this change did sorry for the noise.
Sorry for the noise..
Completely missed issue 614..
Sorry typo: "our part" in place of "one part" above.
Sorry I thought issue (and provided patch) were about cocoon-servlet-service-impl used by either C2.2 and C3 but only now I see that instead they are related to cocoon-servlet-service-components (C2.2 only).
I'm sorry Mark I came back here to remove my comment as after building the app from scratch I have found that by default it used WhenExhaustedAction = GROW and not BLOCK!
Sorry about that tiredness.
Sorry about the error guys.
Yes sorry.
sorry this bug is *not* fixed.
Sorry.
Resolving again....
Sorry yes I believe this has been resolved.
Sorry for the spam - but which test method - can't find any related to the SnapPuller on trunk.
Sorry about that.
Yes the patch is badly named - sorry!
Sorry attached the file to the wrong issue.
