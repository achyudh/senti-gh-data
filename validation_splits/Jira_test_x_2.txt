I wholeheartedly agree this API is confusing as hell.
Not only it's the first one in my life I'm seeing multiple ways of closing the same thing it also conceals programming errors.
Sucks to rush a commit when an issue is under discussion.
I'm against such heavy committing myself without some consensus to do so.
I'm confused.
> I hated that aspect of working for commercial companies.
My bad.
My bad.
Igor is an idiot and we *do* need gmake.
Shit I missed a cast.
But even if it wasn't it would be totally worthless where it is at.
This is clearly bad webserver behaviour.
Forget what I made(D8067).
PreCommit-HDFS-Build is stuck.
So it is stuck somewhere.
I don't want one-offs like this to become lost and forgotten.
But now that I think about it it may crap out when coming back to read even on a recovered file.
Matt... I'm an idiot I used the wrong patch. Sigh.
I'm however very interested in this feature as it is essential to me.
bq. this is solr's fault by having a getter that does some heavy duty xml shit.
Holy complicated-as-shit-algorithm Batman! The complexity of our implementation vs the complexity of what we're actually doing is starting to worry me here.
It also happens at the very startup after he has loaded only 3 sstables (hence DataTracker likely have 3 sstables not a shit load).
Shit my bad. The posted patch is from a completely wrong branch of my git repo - I had not realized I ran the test-patch against a branch not branch0.
(In this particular case Hoss clearly intended to use the no-no word as an intensifier and not to stir shit.)
Maybe only one of us should play lawyer and the other one play engineer.
I used to be the latter but then I went to law school and got a degree in this shit.
Then to make matters worse since the mid0990's I've been offering pro bono advice to non-profit foundations whose members insult me regularly and assume I'm an amateur.
Someone but I'm not sure who owes me a public apology here. /Larry
Shit there is an dependency. Please go to Preferences -> LDAP -> Entry Editor and enable the option "Show operational attributes".
that's bad Content-Type from gSOAP.
Pull it back in if you think different.
Hmm ... this is quite bad.
You are messing down deep below hbase in dfs.
Damn it sry lost the orientation.
Oh my stupid:)
oh ...geez I'm an idiot.
jira - I wish you didn't suck so much.
Indeed that would be VERY bad design.
My bad.
(How bad is this?
I'm confused.
This is pretty trivial.
Of course it could... :-) DOH!
Then you're pretty well screwed.
Damn Chuck is scary.
This is bad.
Well that sucks.
Bad memory.
The state stuck at "Allocated state" It is a dup of 3788.
This is a pretty awful bug.
Replaced patch with fix to catch more bad variables
Does this suck?
Of course StrFieldSource is a private class No it's not.
CSS is really confusing sometimes.
Django is a fullstack framework Click is not.
My bad.
Credit of course goes to Dick.
It seems really confusing.
+1 for this: my bad.
Hell or high water.
0 to jar hell.
That would suck.
If so a test that succeeds with errors is confusing as hell...
If the different segments are somewhat homogeneous then these stats should pretty much be very close anyway.
Thanks for reporting solved!
it belongs to faces 1.2 :)
Ok cool this is just a matter of adding strings to the various [NotFound()|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L160] returns in files.cpp There are a number of error cases in the [browse|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] and [read|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] endpoints I'd imagine one could change the javascript to generate bad requests which should be sufficient to test this :)
cool no worries.
Cool feature! Performance: - It looks like scripts are read from the resource loader and parsed again (eval) for every update request.
Thanks Ram That seems like a definite improvement.
Interesting that you decided not to detect the error based on finding two similarly-named operations.
It's OK.
Hi Suran The new catalogs_b.patch looks very good.
Nice feature lars!!
:) I've renamed ComponentColorProperty to be ComponentColorElement and RelationshipAggregation to TwistieAggregation.
Looks like this is fixed :)
Version 2.2.0RC3 is fine.
Sounds like a good idea.
Many thanks for your help.
Thank you!
I've tested them out and everything is fine.
Is that ok for this file (b/c I have no idea how to do the svn move now ... after I've made all the changes already) :)
Thanks once again.
bq. OK w/ the latest patch all tests pass for me! Great Awesome! :)
Great! Awesome! thanks Dims
