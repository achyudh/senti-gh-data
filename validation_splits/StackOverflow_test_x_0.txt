A smarter, entirely C++-way of doing what you want is using . Especially helps you to accomplish what you want. Please see the excellent about how to use it!
Ok, I find the reason: device won't answer to simple user (and doesn't matter what permissions did you ask in program manifest). You can directly speak to device only if you are root (or from kernel mode). That means you cannot use devices directly from general applications. Very sad :(

The TIFF file can store various image types: Bilevel (B/W) Grayscale Palette-color RGB full-color The storing of actual image data is done differently for each image type. The is not the scariest I have seen, but it is definitely not trivial!
I don't understand why (Apple in this moment I'm hating you!), but ALAssetsLibrary in iOS 4.3.4 does not allow fetching in a background thread (I was running a series of in a ). I solved by creating a little wrapper using . EDIT: After a code refactoring and the upgrade to iOS 5, I finally realized that the problem is actually related to how ALAssetsLibrary works, there is no need to use . .

Hi I'm using the chrome inspector (F12) to try and analyze the z-index of a twitter bootstrap popover, and finding it extremely frustrating... Is there a way to freeze the popover (while shown) so that I can assess and modify the associated CSS? Placing a fixed 'hover' on the associated link does not cause the popover to appear.
This is an absolutely horrid wart in the API, but it's never going away.
@VitoshKa Excellent! Wish I could give you another up vote for th update
I have a long scrolling page, and want to test if an element is 100px from the top, then apply a class elsewhere (until the next element in line is 100px from the top) If I could just get the basic statement I would be ecstatic, anything extra would be a bonus!
I am working with Eclipse (Indigo) to develop C projects. When I create a new C project in a new workspace, by default the "Autosave before build" option is not set. This is extremely frustrating, as autosave is usually the default behavior in other IDE's I worked on. I change some code, build and nothing seems to go as expected - until I remember that the option is not set... Is there a way to make Eclipse open a new workspace with this option set?
Great time saver and hidden gem. Excellent!
I have hit this too. No solution as yet. This is very worrying though!
TRUNCATE_ONLY option on log backup is discontinued in SQL 2008.
Guy's I am at my wit's end. I've got a VPS that I'm mucking around on, so nothing is important, but nginx is being a complete pain. I've deleted all of the content inside and restarted. Visting the ip of the server simply results in a page with one word on it: I just don't get it. Is this normal nginx behaviour? I've deleted the entire conf file and restarted, so why is this happening?
100m (milli) means a loadavg of 0.1: your server is pretty fine!
You can register any serializable type with the clipboard provider:
Shoulld be:
Firstly, that's not how works. You have to specify constants for each , and those constants will be compared to the expression in parentheses (in your case, ). That is how works, period. Secondly, switch is not faster than several s And thirdly, you shouldn't really worry about miniscule performance optimizations when you're dealing with javascript.
Compare these two methods: Aside from the method signatures (bar can declare instead of ), is there any practical difference between the two methods? To be clear: I'm aware that this is a horrible approach to exception handling, and should not be done!
Excellent! That makes life considerably easier. I really didn't want to add another layer to the application if I could avoid it. As far as StackOverflow etiquette goes, if I set this question as answered, Nikos won't get the rep for it as the answer is in the comments. What's the protocol?
Excellent article! Very useful :)

This is one of the shortcomings of DGV that I absolutely hate and why I almost always bind to an IEnumerable of an anonymous type.

A simple Google search would suffice for this question. All are excellent resources (and the top three Google links!). Essentially, there's a new API which allows JS to request fullscreen access. That's about it.
put your path and your shadow in a set. apply your animation to the set and it'll affect both. a really terrible example where I move both at once.
Yep I've been testing some stuff recently under Safari 5.1.5 (WinXP) recently and when you have elements with tabindex="0", all the elements EXCEPT links ( with "href" defined) are focusable. By all elements, I mean s, s etc. It's absolutely amazing for me from the accessibility point of view!

I have developed a cumulative sum function as defined below in the Haskell library Repa. However, I have run into an issue when combining this function with the transpose operation. All 3 of the following operations take well under a second: However, if I write: performance degrades horrendously. While each individual operation in isolation takes well under a second on a 1920x1080 image, when combined they now take 30+ seconds... Any ideas on what could be causing this? My gut tells me it has something to do with delayed arrays, not forcing at the right time, etc... But I do not have enough experience to track this down quite yet.
@Mario I disagree, while the answer is outrageously awful, it's still an answer.
Don't do that. Use instead. is a FIFO queue that lets you pass data around threads without worrying (much!) about locking semantics.
No worries Stephen!
The following program prints 0, not std::string::npos as I expected. Why?
If I have a setup project in a VS 2010 solution and I add/remove another project, or unload/reload another project any setup projects in the solution are expanded in the solution explorer. It only does this for setup projects and it is extremely annoying. Is there any way to disable this behaviour?
sounds like desirable behaviour to me! How do you make it do that again?!?
I am learning ML. Can some one please help me out with basic input/output functions in ML?? I just want to read input from console and store it in a variable and use it in my ML program. Please help. If you can point me towards some example for this also it would be super great!!! Thank you.
I appreciate your warm welcome, I never seen such a warm regard here for trying to be helpful, it was a really pleasant introduction and I want to thank you for taking your time to write - at last the end of the questions reads "If anyone has any ideas I would be extremely grateful!"
Excellent point! Thanks!! I did mean just the left side though.. (I should have specified that). Was glad to learn your insight though..
This is really great question - well organised and explained, nicely done!
Thanks. That was a really great pointer!

My guess is that you would have to extend the classes for DataTip, to check for NULL hitData objects, to kill/stop the drawing of the display. I do not think there is a way to do that normally in FLEX. You would have to customize and override the hitData class unfortunately. What a pain!!

I had a memory crash on UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext() ... if you're creating and releasing a lot of them, you should wrap them in a fresh AutoReleasePool for each iteration.

Stu Nicholls's site has a lot of examples of how to do this without javascript. It's a really excellent resource.
i am currently having some difficulties trying converting a Unicode character string (DT_WSTR) into an INT this is what i have (Note most writings are in German, but i think someone who has worked with SSIS will unterstand anyways) Data Type selected: A four-byte, unsigned integer.but all it does is fail terribly

Yes, you need two view controllers. Check out lesson 7 from Stanfords CS193P iPhone Application Programming course. It is available online. Both slides and the lecture through iTunes U. I really enjoyed watching the course!
Out of all that pseudocode, the only thing that really worries me is "extracts code samples from file". Reading files from a directory is trivial, saving a file is trivial. Regardless of the test framework I'd spend most of my time focusing on the parsing bit. For direct testing, I'd embed the snippets directly into the test case: Ah, I see another change I subtly made while writing the test: my ExamplesToCode.parse() returns an Array (or other iterable container), so that it can be tested apart from the iteration itself.
no worries! it happens all the time.
Excellent, thank you!

I have tried to reinstall, redownload and then reinstall, tried other directories, other .less files, tried recompiling manuall - but nothing works. Has anyone experienced this? Thanks!
Oh, this was was a pain! I probably lost 2 hours on this. Here is the solution: CMake uses short 'C' applications to test/try things. If the CMakeLists.txt states that C++ is used for the project, without also listing C, then some of those shorts tests incorrectly fail, and cmake then thinks those things aren't found. The solution was to change the first line of CMakeLists from this: ...to include C as a language: Then delete , recreate it, and everything then works:
In your code, strip out the stop words. You'll have to maintain your own list.

I am building the Android OS on Mac OSX (Lion), and Eclipse as an IDE. I am trying to understand certain parts of the OS however this requires performing many searches throughout the project. These searches take 5 or 10 minutes on Eclipse, and the way they are presented is also extremely annoying. Also, I need a separate editor to open up the native files found in the OS, since if they are opened in Eclipse there is no color coding of the C++ syntax. I feel that Eclipse is really slowing me down - can anyone suggest a better IDE for browsing the Android OS (preferably free)?
I recently worked on a product that was targeted to .NET 3.5. Out of hundreds of beta testers, I can probably count on one hand the number that already had .NET 3.5. The rest had to sit through the absolutely painful .NET 3.5 install from microsoft (~30 minutes, and most of the time the progress bar stays near 0 so people think it is broken).

The search bots don't care about hash tags. And if you are using them for some kind of flash or AJAX calls, you have more serious problems than your 301 redirects don't work. Because unless you have the content in an alternate form, the search engines are not indexing your site and you are definitely suffering as far as SEO goes.
I'm doing one app which requires AJAX call on almost every user interaction possible, I started writing JS functions, webservices etc. to handle all of that(still long way to go from here). Now I am wondering If I made a mistake maybe I should put whole page in update panel because I really hate writting JS. Is there some drawback to use it instead of custom written ajax calls to web service and js functions, and is it better to use more update panels or one big?
That answer was extremely helpful Scott, thanks for the pointer on that!
An object created by a user is really no different from one you create yourself (except you have to be suspicious of potentially malicious input!).

So I'm trying to write a RR Rotation and LL Rotation with Java for an AVL tree. I have most of it figured out, however I don't know where I should modify the height within the method. I've been trying to understand it for a few days here but I cannot figure out where exactly it would go in the method I currently have.

This is a common problem, and it's not a matter of "PHP is lying to me!" You have to understand how PHP sends the emails, and how servers interpret and process them.

I found this great node mysql boilerplate: it works terrific! However, now I need to hook it in to my existing user table, and my key field is named userID, not simply id, and changing the key fieldname in mysql breaks the example. So my question is, where in the project do I need to specify a different id field name? I see user.id in /util/auth.js passport.serializeUser and id in passport.deserializeUser functions, but it seems it must be specified elsewhere too. I'm hoping this is a simple question for users of passportjs!

No worries! Keep at it...it's overwhelming at first, but it gets easier
This code seemed to do it: The accepted answer goes to dystroy as he was the first to point me in the right direction, excellent answer by Bart Kiers though, +1!

i have an assignment at my company to build a custom cms, for the foundation i ve chosen latest laravel(version 4, i believe). Now, the requirements in laravel docs() say minimal version of php on server required is 5.3.7, our servers have php 5.3.23. I am right now on a weekend, so i cant check my code on the server( been developing the basics on localhost with xampp which has latest php). Has anyone tried laravel 4 on pre-5.3.7 php?? i m very worried all of last week's work is going to the bin... :(
