Is there a way to have mod_wsgi reload all modules (maybe in a particular directory) on each load? While working on the code, it's very annoying to restart apache every time something is changed. The only option I've found so far is to put below every import.. but that's also really annoying since it means I'm going to have to go through and remove them all at a later date..
Is it possible to use Twitter's API to grab search results? For example, if I wanted my page to show all tweets (man I hate that term) with the word "cat" in it? Is it also possible to get just the matching results that were after a certain date?
One thing I forgot, make sure the dev database you are running the migration from (the sql server database) is updated from production immediately before each test run. Hate to have something fail on prod because you were testing against outdated records.
@Kev its a deployment headache, you can ilmerge it in ... but still its an extra bit of luggage you need to worry about
Hate to say it, but I don't think there is a way to alleviate this. I do think that it depends on the client system, though, so a faster javascript engine or machine may make it slightly more accurate.
COM components are really a pain to manage, update, versioning, etc.
Notably, the debugger shows the string *with* escape characters. When the string is printed in the console, the escape characters are not included. "\"code\"" vs. "code". This 100 character limit is very annoying as it prevents you from copying, say, a long JSON string and then immediately pasting that string (escape characters included) as a test string variable in your code.
i am also having this exact problem. large table, nested divs within table. firefox renders teh page within 10 seconds, ie renders the table after a wait of 2 minutes. firefox still zips along with teh drag and dtop, ie crawls.. infact it freezes, and the drag and drop sdoes not work. am going to try some of teh solutions below. the fixed width, and the #id tagname.class references. But i do fear that it will still be slow. if anyone else has some good i deas, I would be all ears.
I'm developing an OSX application () that runs with LSUIElement set (system menu only - no tray icon, doesn't appear in cmd-tab). It works totally fine, but someone just pointed out that it has a blank process name in the Activity Monitor listing. Just says nothing. Everything else in there has a name. Even other apps running at LSUIElement. I've tried to search around the web, but I can't spot anyone talking about this. What on earth should I be looking for?
I'm new to Flash but want to create a nice video for a product. It takes a long time to make a nice looking presentation , and I'm hoping for a jump start. Are there any good templates which are free on the internet where I can quickly change the text in ,for example, to make my video? I've tried looking in google, and there are too many websites, many of which look gimmicky. Any recommendations? (A video like this one - - would be amazing!)
@DevSolar I would like to use boost more, but its synergy with C++11 is terrible, and there are some rather... _curious_ design decisions (Iostreams requires Devices to be copyable, but makes streams noncopyable... oh, and also nonmovable - at least in th
A better, more common practice is to put in the combo box only the items that can be selected. It won't prevent keyboard usage (I, as a user, would find this offensive!) and simplify code.
I'm cleaning up the CSS on a fairly large (and somewhat disorganized) website. Is there a simple way (or a piece of software) that will let me find, for example, all the "a" tags that are within "h3" tags? Or all the "spans" that are within "p" tags? I want to modify some of these CSS rules but I'm afraid I'll break something hidden somewhere. Any advice?
encryption/decryption of the relevant code as well, and emit the IL. This would be another layer of obscurity that although doesn't ultimately protect you really, it does make it a little more of a pain. Also, post your question at reverse-engineering.net forums and see what those crackers say.
I have an image and on it are logos (it's a map), I want to have a little box popup with information about that logo's location when the user moves their mouse over said logo. Can I do this without using a javascript framework and if so, are there any small libraries/scripts that will let me do such a thing?
I'd just keep creating my own dependency properties, personally. It really isn't much extra work, and then you don't have to worry about any of the possible caveats.
@JonHanna Why, then, did he invoke "Hoare's dictum"? Knuth's paper was more about clarity than about optimization. The quote never actually appears in the paper; rather, he wrote "In our previous discussion we concluded that premature emphasis on efficien
What about forgetting all the wrapping of the functor pointer, and instead use as the functor? that way, you don't have to worry about managing the copy in any way shape or form.
@MrChrister : The actualOrderNumber is relied on by multiple legacy app. Changing it would be extremely problematic. The end-user-visible order number is also used in several apps; adding a new field is do-able but hard. An obscuring "format" outside the
As mentioned on StackOverflow podcast 30 - JanRain RPX has beaten me. Sad face for me.
I'm thinking of creating a small offline blog editor for personal use and I don't know how do the APIs work. Where can I find this information? I'm particularly looking for the most common providers: Blogger, Wordpress, MovableType, Live Spaces (not sure if this has an API) etc.
I have added a reference to an excellent article showing to go about it.
I am new to .NET in general, so I hope this isn't too n00b of a question. I'm looking to write a Silverlight app that interacts with a MSSQL DB using LINQ. Do I absolutely, positively have to use a seperate WCF service? It seems there are security implications, but this would be on a completely trusted network. Thanks in advance
This algorithm is terribly inefficient for small sample chosen from a large set. Picking 5 integers from a million takes one million calls to rand() instead of 5.
I often need to execute custom sql queries in django, and manually converting query results into objects every time is kinda painful. I wonder how fellow Slackers deal with this. Maybe someone had written some kind of a library to help dealing with custom SQL in Django?
The last thing you should be worrying about is how fast one of these is. There is no way that checking a string for being an integer is going to be a bottleneck in your code.
The move to version 7 is painful, I totally agree. Our process has taken just as long (and seems to be stretching out forever) - especially coming away from Rational Suite into individual v7 products.
What's the easiest static (non-animating) 3d model format to load with Java? I used .obj in C++, but that's a pain to do in java. Is there anything better?
I wouldn't class that a problem. If you structure things in a meaningful way, you should be able to look at the JS, see where all the event hooks are. If you're worried too much about it, you *could* set the rel attr to js, or prepent the ID with js_, etc.
Sharepoint recognize file types using their extensions. If you are worried about users spreading malicious application/code in your Sharepoint Sites. I suggest you to take a look at . You can modify the excluded extension list under Central Administration > Operations > Blocked File Types.
In netbeans, if I select some text and press , it works correctly and the text is indented to the right side as expected. But if I then try to backspace behind the text, it only removes one space at a time. Very annoying. Is there any way to change this setting, so backspacing behind a tabbed line causes the whole tab to be removed and not just 1 space?
It's a terrible idea to include a using directive in a header file too. This simply mitigates that problem.
Why do you hate Photoshop?
Don't want to beat a dead horse, but it is really important that you understand that this is a terrible idea.
A few months ago the Coding Horror blog reported on some platform with an atrociously bad sorting algorithm. If you have to use that platform then you sure do want to implement your own instead.
ADG is a terrible and wondrous thing. I'm still trying to figure out the "data" object structure when using group fields Cheers
Ah, this was actually dumb...I solved it. I had two checked out directories that were both very much the same. I was in Eclipse and I didn't realize that I had been editing the wrong file all along. STUPID! STUPID! STUPID! Oh well it's not a total loss, now you all get to see how to fix ff3.
In general, this is a _terrible_ idea. C++ headers are not intended to be included in an alternately namespace as was used here.
I want to be able to play sound files in my program. Where should I look?
can you help? i have a DB, the unique identifiers are GUIDS - we need to implement URL rewriting however the page names look terrible for example: testpage-2668FF87-0A3A-4cac-B9AB-2367D17A76C3.aspx title of page / unique identifier my DB's that i setup i use Ints as unique identifiers so i never had this problem: testpage-1.aspx title of page / unique identifier (int) what do you suggest ?
Actually, thinking about it, i think it had to do with SiteCore. I think VS choked when trying to render the sitecore stuff

Ramesh - I would implement this using supertype and subtype relationships in my E-R model. There are a few different physical options you have of implementing the relationships as well.
I have been using (and loving) the jQuery intellisense for Visual Studio 2008 (blogged about by Scott Guthrie ) but has any one ever come across an intellisense script for the components of jQuery? Thanks!
Would've loved to. But there is no hash_map in the C++ standard library, and PHB's don't allow code outside of that.

I have one of the Microsoft keyboards with their Function lock... man I hate that thing.
It depends on your OS, CPU, Compiler, and possibly other factors. In general it means the CPU bus could not complete a command, or suffered a conflict, but that could mean a whole range of things depending on the environment and code being run.
I have a video player that loads progressive flv video from a server and applies a reflection to it. I do this by creating a bitmapData object and then drawing the video to it. This worked absolutely fine until we moved our content from testing server to Amazon S3. Now there is no reflection. Can anyone explain why this is happening and even suggest a solution? p.s. i am using Flash 8 AS2. thanks
You have my deepest sympathies. I feel your pain. I was trapped in that world for a while.
awesome! it works
Great question!! I'm hoping to use something like migrations with Django too.
Excellent question.
@Lance: the first one is also executing. Compare it with a named constructor: this is actually also executing code. The same goes for the anonymous constructor... But that was not the question ;-)
Why do people use "*nix" instead of just typing "unix"? Are you afraid of a trademark lawsuit?
There's an RFC for how to read RFCs. Love it!
This question is still incredibly vague about what you are looking for. I guess your acceptance of an answer, however, lets us reverse engineer the problem.
Methods that are not 'const' will most likely change the state of the object. That is exactly the reasoning behind object orientation : you call operations that do stuff, and you don't have to worry about the object's internal state.
I have two arrays of animals (for example). How can I merge the two arrays into one by the ID?
I am currently developing a system on a server running PHP version 5.1.6 thus I am forced to use Symfony 1.1 in the current environment. I am planning to migrate the application from 1.1 to 1.2 in the somewhat near future and I was wondering if anyone has any experience with this? I have attempted to migrate a system from 1.0 to 1.1 and that was a major pain in the rear. How has it been for anyone out there migrating from Symfony 1.1 to 1.2?
I agree - this is a very good introduction to SSAS and MDX!
Consider using Ragel That's what powers mongrel under the hood. Parsing a string multiple times is going to slow things down dramatically.
@Rob, the only thing `onclick` should be intended to do is be taken out back and shot. Metadata used to indicate that an element is enhanced in a behavior layer may "smell" depending on implementation (I would personally use `class`, which doesn't repurpo
I would say you should be worried about using primitives over wrappers only when you profile your application and see that the autoboxing is a performance or memory issue. In my experience memory becomes an issue before CPU cycles when talking about primitives vs wrapping objects.
Great chart! Good find.
Great, thank you, that fixed my issue!
This is great! Thanks +1
I can't help think that making XML ad XMLList both unrelated, as in both extend Object directly, is a design flaw in the AS3 core library. Surely having XML extend XMLList would be a much cleaner system, where XML is considered an XMLList with only one member? This would also avoid the very annoying practice of an E4X query possibly returning either an XML or XMLList, which can result in a casting error. So is there any reason I'm not thinking of that XML and XMLList were designed to only have Object as a common type?
I'd really love the surrounding content to "scroll" up/down in like when using Scroll - but would also love the appropriate div to "fade" in.
if the 2 structures variable are initialied with calloc or they are set with 0 by memset so you can compare your 2 structures with memcmp and there is no worry about structure garbage and this will allow you to earn time
I'm sure lots of people will say this by the time I've typed this but... I know it's not PHP but we're finding just the job for this kind of thing. It really is an excellent piece of software.
I too advise to use the simple way (KISS !-) -- but some optimization could be found, namely not to test the length of an array more than once:
In theory, you could apply that philosophy to every single question on SO. But it would be terribly boring to do so.

I have various files that I want to be ignored by SVN when committing. I know that I can go into TortoiseSVN and ignore them in various ways. I know that I can run svn propedit svn:ignore from the command line to do the same thing. The problem is that I have to have everyone on my team to do that, which is a pain. Is there a way that I can put some file in a folder or set something in my SVN repository that tells it to never check a certain file in?
I have a gridview with rows that can be edited, inserted etc. I wrapped it in an updatepanel to give it an AJAX effect and update the system without reloading the page. I recently got into using jQuery and webservices for my AJAX calls and I absolutely love how it works and how fast it is. I would like to know if it is possible, and if so then how, to update my gridview using jQuery AJAX methods.
Newbie question. Iâm writing an ASP.Net MVC app in VB.Net and have been using NerdDinner as a sample (which is in C#). Iâm stuck on the validation process specifically the code found in Models\Dinner.cs . I have tried converting it to VB.Net using but it chokes on the Yield statement which found in the GetRuleViolations method (see code below). So my question is how would you do the equivalent in VB.Net? namespace NerdDinner.Models { }

Alan, I assume some people already hate you just for asking. And they have a point.
I have a basic app written with ATL, using the wizard with VS2008. I have a treeview in the left side of the app. I see how to (painfully) add tree items. Question is how do I show a menu when the mouse is right clicked? How do I trap any click events on each item that could be selected?
this one is great!
For C# Visual Studio uses 4 spaces by default, whereas for C++ it is hard-tabs. Why is it so? Why is it different? My project consists of both C# and C++ code and the difference really annoys me. I want to set a common standard for all the sources, but I wonder if this would have any drawbacks.
A great explanation! Thanks:)
I intended to post this quote. It is very true :-)

if all you have is the GUID, how would you know which table it came from?
Why the down-votes and sniping? It's not a particularly well-asked question but it's certainly valid and by definition programming related. (it's pretty hard to do anything with Django without programming as it's a web programming framework!)
My project has an object that creates a process. It this object's Dispose function, it kills the process (or tries to). However, if the program crashes, it leaves the process running and doesn't clean up. Which causes the program to fail next time because it tries to launch the process again and can't get a lock on it. How can I make sure this process is killed? I always use the object that creates the process in a block For reference I'm using C# and .NET 3.5
Old question, I know, but I found it while searching for a similar answer. Unless the API has changed, the reason why harpo's answer isn't working is because is an instance method, not a static method. But fear not--there's an instance of present in each instance of --the property. So in your case, if you're within a controller (or, I suspect, a view): That should do the trick!
I've got tables like this: I want to merge them like: In this new table, Name in Table.Articles will belong to Title column, because.. Articles.Name and Books.Title mean the same thing :) Any answers will be very appreciated :) Thanks

ctypes is in the python standard library, swig and boost are not. Swig and boost rely on extension modules and are therefore tied to python minor versions which indepentent shared objects are not. building a swig or boost wrappers can be a pain, ctypes makes no build requirements.
I doubt that you will find that much help, considering this is a technique usually reserved for malicious usage (bots, etc).
Great sample code!

I have a class, let's call it LineGraph, that renders a line graph. I need to subclass it, but the derived class is only used in one place and is coupled to the class that uses it. So I am using an inner class. I see two ways to do this: Anonymous inner class Named inner class I am not a fan of anonymous inner classes, because frankly I just think it looks really ugly. But in the case of a subclass that's only used in one place, is a named inner class overkill? What is the accepted practice?

Hey, I'm new to this site. I think it is great! Okay, here's the deal. I just downloaded Smule Ocarina. I was wondering how they made it so you can upload a song to the cloud. I might have an app idea that might incorporate this. How would I do this? What would I need?

Here's the site: www.red-tuxedo.com I want the "Red Tuxedo" text to sit next to the logo, not below, and I want to get rid of that hard rule that runs through the logo. My CSS / HTML skills aren't up to it. I completely destroy the column layout when I change the text and I can't find the hard rule in the code. Tried adjusting the gif (cut off the bottom in Photoshop) and that didn't help. I did write to the person who created the template; haven't heard back after several days. Would like to get this fixed before I start adding more pages. thx

Currently the msbuild logs for team build are appalling as they are just plain text and are very difficult to read.

I can't comment (yet) so I have to add my comment this way. I thing Mr. David Murdoch's advice is the best for Opera ( ). OMG, what a lovely girl he's got btw. I've tried his approach in Opera and I succeeded basically doubling the input tags in this way: This way the 1st element is hidden but it CATCHES the display focus Opera would give to the 2nd input element instead. LOVE IT!
This suffers from the race condition of having another process started between querying the system for it and returning to the caller saying it wasn't found. Using the mutex approach is one way around it.

I'm reading about the CallContext class (). The documentation says something about "logical threads" and "Thread Local Storage". What's a logical thread, I didn't know that there existed multiple kinds of threads? What's a Thread Local Storage, is it a class or a principle of some kind? I have not been able to find it in on MSDN, but I'm sure it is there some place, so any links would be great :-)
If you give each key a unique name, e.g. "invoices.invoice_id" instead of "invoices.id", then you can use the "natural join" and "using" operators with no worries. E.g. instead of SQL is verbose enough without making it more verbose.

Take a look at . Bear in mind that running both side by side is not supported by Microsoft () and there's no guarantee that they will work absolutely fine side by side - a Windows Update could easily break something and sometimes people find conditional comments don't work properly amongst other things.

In Sql Server 2005, set auto create statistics and auto update statistics. You won't have to worry about creating them or maintaining them yourself, since the database handles this very well itself.

I only have one important piece of advice - make absolutely sure you can revert back to the state before you started the refactor without losing anything. Then just dive in and go for it. You may well end up having to stop and start again, but that's nothing to be afraid of (as long as you heeded my one piece of advice). You'll learn a lot doing it.

Won't the guilty party simply increase the minimum amount that they'll try? I know they're trying to fly under the radar of the banks and on bank statements, but these days 10-20 is a more common amount to see on your statement than 2.35. Do you have specific experience with this?
The ObservableCollection is most likely the solution, but if it still gives you grief, you can directly access your static resource by calling the following code after your list gets updated:

I'm using Rob Con's repository pattern also - absolutely love it. But i'm not worrying about concurrency checks. I load the most recent object, then update the fields the submitchanges. I would look at seeing if you could use the Attach and/or timestamps. It's been a while since i've looking into linq + concurrency.
with the interoperability approach (wsdl-first), are you still hand coding the wsdl? If so, are you still running into the same pain points you've described? Or have you have you found a better solution?

We are currently using PDE to automatically build features and our complete product. It works quite well. Make sure you use the right script for product build or feature build. EDIT: We've now migrated to , which has an excellent command line interface.
The method in .NET returns a by-ref version of a type, e.g. passing the type of returns a type representing . However, if you already have a , what is the mechanism for obtaining a plain old ? There doesn't seem to be an opposite method to remove the by-ref modifier. At the moment I've put a hack in place which re-builds the assembly-qualified name without an at the end of the type name and then loads that type, but this is horribly dirty...
Could you add some details about the error you get? Nothing is jumping out at me as horribly wrong.

the way memory handling works in C extension of python has nothing to do with RAII, and is certainly not scope based. I wish it were, though, because as much as I hate C++, RAII is the one thing that makes C++ better than C in this area.

This is simply the tip of the WTF iceberg I'm exposing with this question. The rest of the app, and the purpose for its very existence is more painful, if you'll believe it.
I think I read somewhere recently (might even have been on SO but I can't find the question) that in a debug session, pressing stop in VS just kills the process and no GC takes place. However closing the app window normally performs GC as expected. Is this correct? Also, what happens when a (non-debug) process is killed in task manager - does the GC still cleanup?
if efficiency is the case, I would use SAX or on a personal preference - StAX
Evaluation of what? I may be being slow today, but I really don't understand what your problem is. I'm awful tempted to vote to close on the principle that I don't see a real question.
Your solution is subject to all sorts of horrible HTML escaping issues and possibly injection attacks.
Maybe the answers might just be more insightful if I remove the limitations... I can't just "take the time" since there are a finite number of hours on this contract. Almost the entire code needs to be refactored. I am trying to identify the areas that will reduce the immediate pain.
Anyone have a graphical tool for developing mod_rewrite rules. Ideally it would display a pipeline of rewrites and then when given an instance of a uri would show the transforms as the get applied. It's always a pain to get them setup just right so any way of making it easier would help.
Couldn't agree more about TextPad being an excellent editor (my personal favourite). However, whilst it does search over multiple files (and very quickly at that) it doesn't do search and replace over multiple files.

I'm using a WPF validation for TextBox validation. I have defined this Template: The TextBox is located on a form in a TabItem. Everything works fine, but the '!' TextBlock stays visible when I choose other TabItems. This behaviour is observed in many other cases - when expander expands etc.. the Excklamation always stays visible on the same place, although the TextBox is not diplayed.

I have a main flash from wich i load another swf file from the server. From time to time i change the second swf file and want to load a fresh copy from the server. I clean the cache from the browser but my client does not know how to do that and it's a pain to give him directions. If i want to load a fresh copy of the main swf i just add a "main.swf?version2" but i can't do that with the loadMovie function in flash. Any ideas how i can get a fresh copy from the server without changing the name of the file?
I don't think it's a matter of which language is better. In the .NET world there are some inconsistencies between the libraries different languages provide. There are certain functionality that is available in VB.NET that you might like to use from C# but can't. I remember I had to use J# to use some ZIP libraries that were not available in any other language in .NET.

x86 processors suffer a "partial register stall" if you, say, write to `ax` and then try to read from `eax`. Something to be aware of if you're mixing 16- and 32-bit operations.
Great comment! In my case it doesn't get larger than 64bit, but it is still interesting, what to do if it does? Why should I use "double" in such case?
For the record, while I have seen an implementation where calling on a was O(n), I haven't seen any STL implementations where calling on a was anything other than O(1) -- mainly because s are guaranteed to have random-access iterators.

Totally useless for VB (no anonymous Action delegates), but I can see it working with C#. Can you show how you foresee it being called?
Just to add more - JavaScriptSerializer and DataContractJsonSerializer aren't always compatible with each-other (DateTime, IIRC, is a pain).
Do you need to worry about hitting the server with too many requests at once?
If its just the quotes you are worried about, then just write a simple loop to dump character by character to a string ignoring the quotes. Alternatively if you are using some string manipulation library, you can use it to remove all quotes and then concatenate them.
Do you have any JNI in your application code? Then maybe you need to worry about 32 vs. 64 bit native binaries. 32 or 64 is all the same to your Java code. The performance aspects already seem well covered by previous posters.
I actually tend to prefer PascalCase here - but out of habit, I'm guilty of UPPER_CASE...

If using a numeric key, make sure the datatype is giong to be large enough to hold the number of rows you might expect the table to grow to. If using a guid, does the extra space needed to store the guid need to be considered? Will coding against guid PKs be a pain for developers or users of the application. If using composite keys, are you sure that the combined columns will always be unique?
I can think of scenarios where initial sealing might be desirable until inheritance is required. I have some libraries that make use of the implied 'sealed' knowledge to optimise some dynamic (run-time) processing (e.g. the knowledge that there is never going to be a derived class).

Although I didn't technically end up escaping the dot, your suggestion actually did make me realize another alternative. While wondering how I would "pass" the escape code to the "SQL" server, it dawned on me: Why not use a "SQL Pass-Through Query" instead of an ODBC linked table? Since I only need read access to the SQL Server data, it works fine! Thanks!

Is search and replace the only way to rename as asp control in the code behind file? I find this extremely annoying, but it is the only way I can find. Scenario: I'll find a variable that needs renaming (Usually to meet naming convention) I'll rename the variable in the aspx/ascx file. I'll have to go in the code behind files and search and replace. I get annoyed Are there any better ways - preferably that would not touch a similarly named variable in another scope in the project. I'm on VS2008 with resharper -- does VS2010 address this perhaps?
At a guess, you're probably defining your objects in VB as just s, something like this: If so, you're forcing VB to go through the automation interface (IDispatch). Basically, it doesn't know what type you're going to assign to until run-time, so it has to invoke methods on that object via IDispatch::Invoke. To do that, it looks up all the information it needs for an invocation from the object itself at run time.By contrast, your C++ code is probably early-bound, which means offsets into the COM object's vtable are compiled directly into your code. In that case, when/if you change the code so those offsets aren't valid any more, the code will fail horribly.

damn..thats what i was afraid of!!
First: I like your approach of being concentrated on a clean and proper state handling of your application.Excellent! But, as you said: Android can kill activities and manage their lifecycle for itself. The OS may release memory allocated for your activity as soon as possible requiring you to allocate it again. This means your fragment may or may not get destroyed. As you can see in your stack trace, FragmentActivity.onCreate is called.This obviously inddicates your existing resources created within the context of the old activity are not access - able anymore. The only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context. For all other resources you should be aware and handle properly that created resources may be invalid at the time you are trying to access them.
Very annoying, but simply solved! Reason is that by writing you tell ruby: I'm giving a block to this method call... And that's obviously not what you want. Simple fix: just add parentheses to your method call:

I'm just getting my feet wet with multiprocessing(and its totally awesome!), but I was wondering if there was any guidelines to selecting number of processes? Is it just based on number of cores on the server? Is it somehow based on the application your running(number of loops, how much cpu it uses,etc)? etc...how do I decide how many processes to spawn? Right now, I'm just guessing and add/removing processes but it would be great if there was some kind of guideline or best practice. Another question, I know what happens if I add too few(program is slooow) but what if I add 'too many'? Thanks!
I'm working on a Data Warehouse which, in the end, will require me to create reports based on business hours. Currently, my time dimension is granular to the hour.

I just use following code right now. The table is MyISAM 90MB. terms has FULLTEXT INDEX and it is varchar(255). There are 1,000,000 rows on the table. I wonder if there is any solution which is more resource usage friendly than fulltext search on MySQL? Especially in terms of memory. By saying solution, I refer to any solution such as other types of databases, table structures etc. and if the solution would be adaptable to a standart VPS or hosting in general, it would be extremely super duper perfect! Thanks for your time!
I am aware of question, but not to sure how to map it to my current situation. (Rebase is scary, undoing rebase is double scary!) I started out with several different feature branches of my master: I wanted to merge them all together and check they worked before merging back onto the top of master, so I did a: Then Which leaves me with Then I corrected some bits that didn't compile properly, and got the whole feature set to an acceptable state: My problem is that my colleagues tell me that we're not ready for FeatureA. Is there any way for me to keep all my work, but also revert to a situation where I can just rebase FeatureC on to Feature B?
Also if someone could please let me know if my question is hard to understand, I will re-state. This is incredibly frustrating...suddenly my Stylus files are not compiling at all, and I have not changed any code.
I've been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model, builds and outputs a view. I think this is mainly wrong. The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model, select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model, surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.
that's great too! awesome. thank you!
Link works fine!
If you are on 11g you are in Luck :-) you can Use SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED in the Cursor - then you are guaranteed that two threads will never get the same row on a fetch!The RIGHT WAY to do this in Oracle would be Advanced Queueing - since this will solve ALL YOUR PROBLEMS, provides synchronization und parallel execution and other benefits...Before Oracle 11 and without Advanced Queuing (if you really want to code it yourself...) You can do it like this:(The bits marked with autonomous transaction have to be called in a separate method as an autonomous transaction. If the Update returns 0 Rows it can either be because the table is empty, or because two threads accessed the same row. - So we need a separate ending condition counting available rows.

In my mental model of authentication, a user should be distinct from the way they log in. So for example, a User could have an associated EmailLogin (with an email/password), or they could have many (or none). Similarly they could have 0..* associated OpenIDLogin credentials. Are there any existing authentication libraries for Rails which use this method? Alternatively, is this a really terrible idea?

I have no clue if this approach would be feasible or not, but then there are two things you could try:1.Create a singleton class where you and the arraylist. The class might look like this: To access the list you could write: is the name of the getter method and before getting it set it. Else you might get .Also a receiver might start before the list is filled. So always check for null before you use it.2.The other option is you store the list in a cache object like Check for even in this case in the broadcast receiver before using it.Hope that helps!

The problem here is that you already stringified the response as JSON before passing that into another data structure (now as a string) in order to return that as JSON. So you are basically doing a double encode and the "string" gets encoded.So just pass in the data once: So on a small collection like this: Yo get a result like this: If you are really worried about the order of those two keys then you can use the bson "dumps" to go to a string then decode with the standard json decoder in order to get a native dict with the Mongo objects deserialized, then further put into your ordered dict.But really your client should not care about the order of the keys and just expect those root elements.

I can point what you should do then: 1. create script.php and clean all input variables from search page. 2. connect to the database and make a select statement ".. WHERE grad = '$grad' .. 3. protect your form from mysql injection.
That is great news!
You are very welcome! Learn programming, it's a lot of fun!
I added an example of how to use the wrapText function. Good luck with your project!
(I'm assuming you don't have a DMR.)There is no easy/clean way to do this in Cognos. In your query, you'll have to build a calculation for each year in your output. So, something like this for 2013: And basically the same for 2014.Cut the Trans piece out of your crossab. Then you'll nest those two calcs under your years. To get rid of all the zeroes or nulls, select the two columns. From the menu, select , , .Finally, you will drop a calc in next to your Years in the crosstab (not under them). The expression will be (or whatever you end up naming your calcs). Format it as a percent, and you should be good to go.Told you it was a pain!
Great article 0xced, thanks!
Sorry -- Current output is raw HTML as far as I know. I'll double check that, though. Warren -- I suppose that is what I'll have to do. Looks quite scary, though!
If you read the FB.init documentation, there are some parameters that can be used while defining . One of the parameter is which- Determines whether XFBML tags used by social plugins are parsed, and therefore whether the plugins are rendered or not. Defaults to false.You said that in case of pure javascript the like plugin worked that's beacause you must have set to . To get your jquery code to work simply define this paramter to true which is false by default- and it shall work. Good luck!
No worries and good luck with it! ;)
Enumerating all partitions of a set is . Now, all permutations of all partitions of a set will be , although the example is a bit artificial. Now, to come up with a useful algorithm it's a totally different story. I am not aware of any such algorithm, and in any case its scaling will be absolutely awful.
A couple of issues with your code that may be causing the problem is as follows:Do not EVER escape binary data prior to insertionInserting binary data from an upload into the database is a huge no-no. This can inadvertently lead to some very malicious attacks on your server that extend beyond simple SQL injection.That being said, it is not know what the field type is that you are trying to store into, nor how large the image file is. Storing a 2GB upload as a field in a database is probably not a wise idea, but if you wanted to store large images, it is recommended to stream the data into a BLOB field.For smaller files, you can them safely into fields or if allocated enough space.
Am a beginner in using Ember i am working on a template for my site and when i put the TEMPLATE code in a handlebar it's not working but if i remove it form the handlebar it works, meaning i have linked the correct JS and Css files needed.

I'm trying to open a different ajax modal for each table row clicked. So I did this: That, however doesn't work - while this does: If anyone could please point me in the right direction I would be extremely happy :)) Thanks everyone!:)
so im using a simple submit binding to pass a function data: i just started working with KO so i was to write a basic print function to test this input out: my problem is when i hit submit i get a "you entered: undefined" but when i refresh the page the input that is in the form gets an alert. this is very frustrating! idk if this is a knockout problem or a simple HTML one.
Such awful code!

I absolutely despise working with PDF documents. But when I absolutely have to, I have been using . It has quite a bit of functionality, , and it is theoretically free. Though to use it effectively it helps if you get the book that they push on their website. I'm not certain if you can easily make thumbnails with it, but it has worked for me in generating and manipulating PDFs on every project I've worked on so far.
To make it work with zeros just add: while (num >>= 1 && num)
So, I have movieclip named intro. When the intro runs out of frames, how do I tell it to gotoandPlay to maintimeline or upper movieclip without needing user to press any buttons? shouldnt be that hard, right? it was really super easy in actionscript 2, but in 3 I cant even seem to find help/tutorial to do this! thanks!

In Sublime Text 2, if I press escape the page goes into COMMAND mode, which seems to take text input as commands, rather than actually typing the text. Another oddity is the VISUAL mode, and I have no idea what it does besides it seems to highlight text. I think they came installed with the theme that I got, 'soda', maybe. Anyway, I searched and found out you can turn off COMMAND mode by pressing 'i'. Regardless, both of these modes are extremely annoying, how do I get rid of them?
I really really hate to ask this, but did you try rebooting?
Why doesn't the "-C" flag have an option to enable the "use utf8"-pragma?
I would like to implement the same type of functionality as this application: When a user selects a table view cell, the cell animates to fill the entire screen and reveals a new view while animating. I have been trying to find information on how to do this but can't quite seem to find any good resources. How can I accomplish this? Even just an idea of what to properly google search will be extremely helpful!
describes the binary format of objects in some detail. The describes the format in excruciating detail.
The problem is exact what mysql is telling you : you have too much data for one table. Not only the number of fields are counting towards them, but also their size.. But the real problem is in your database design, you have designed a table that is crying out for help : 'split me up, split me up!' You should your design ..
I'm afraid you can't!! Weka is not covering that functionality.
C is a cruel master!
No worries! I've done the same thing many times on SO.
Hi there, I just moved from C#/C++ to JavaScript last night, and am loving it! I've just come across some behavior that I don't understand, wondering if anyone can shed some light on it? When I call this script, I'm getting the expected alert box showing '5.5', however after that box is closed I get another alert simply showing "undefined", can anyone shed any light on this? Code below: Many thanks
@David Wallace: Yes, and it's even more sad when some guys -1 the correct answer!

Hmm I fear I've opened a Pandora's box of higher maths! I'll see if I can understand any of those articles...
logically, each "master" entity should be in its own table if you don't, you'll find joins will become very painful, and your generic lookup table will accumulate all kinds of useless fields

The search term on both Stackoverflow and PInvoke.net yields zero results, so this should be worth asking. I've been fiddling around on MSDN and looking through Win SDK *.h files all day, and feeling a bit out of my element. I'm basically attempting to query the MSRPC endpoint mapper with managed code. Here is what I have so far: The above code isn't complete, but it illustrates my point. The code consistently returns: RpcMgmtEpEltIngNext: 87 87 meaning Parameter is Incorrect according to . So I'm basically stumped at this point, and I'm sure it's because of my extremely crappy PInvoke code.

I use Grunt to run my unit tests without assert modules, i just log what i need with grunt and use my "custom" coditions to check the variables's states and values. I was thinking about using mocha with grunt, but i am trying to find out how it will really change something when i run my tests. How my tests will be more valuable using mocha (for example) ? Regarding the success of these tools, i feel like i am missing something in their utility. If someone could explain to me how and when they are usefull, it would be really great !

Excellent! Did you know that you can answer your own question and accept it as **the** answer. This is considered a good practice, because it helps people looking for answers see that there is an answer and it helps them find the answer. If the answer is only in comments, the question will appear unanswered.

I really hate asking questions that I feel were asked a thousand times before. This is one of those questions I feel others must have encountered, , none of the supposed solutions work for me so I must be doing something wrong..... I have an extremely simple app setup. index.htm, and terms.htm. There is some textual data in test.htm. I set both and at the appropriate time after stuff has loaded. At first I tried loading terms.htm's data into an element within index using (both test and index are in the same root /assets/www/ directory, and my webview loads index oncreate) but absolutely nothing was happening. So I opted to try .ajax so that I could at least get an error message, and all I get is 'error'. Surely, it is possible to load local textual assets with JQ on DroidGap?
For various reasons Microsoft decides that some info should be kept away from developers. But people through reverse engineering find out what these reserved fields are about and produce their own documentation. Some times people guess correct. Some times Microsoft makes breaking changes, and people scream "How dare you!". And life goes on.

Currently making a java program that grabs data off of a MSAccess Database and some of these errors are extremely frustrating. I keep getting this SQL.Exception : Too few parameters.

Is search and replace the only way to rename as asp control in the code behind file? I find this extremely annoying, but it is the only way I can find. Scenario: I'll find a variable that needs renaming (Usually to meet naming convention) I'll rename the variable in the aspx/ascx file. I'll have to go in the code behind files and search and replace. I get annoyed Are there any better ways - preferably that would not touch a similarly named variable in another scope in the project. I'm on VS2008 with resharper -- does VS2010 address this perhaps?

Well, this is incredibly painful in Access, but you can create a numbers table on the fly. Let's assume that is really a unique id in the table. This uses the table to generate a list of numbers, using a correlated subquery to get the numbers. Note that this assumes that is always less than the number of rows in this table. If you know the ids have no gaps and start at 1, you can simplify this to:

Two excellent answers, thank you! I chose Andrew's primarily because I learned a bit more about knockout from it, but both are good options.
