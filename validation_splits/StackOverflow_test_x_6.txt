Same server, i'm using phpMyAdmin and its being a pain saying i'm not using it the right context!?
yes I'm having the exact same issue, very annoying!
This is a method in Java, that(when k == 0) in int[] arr has one of k-combination int[] intems. In variable iloczyn is calculated product of elements in this combination. In tmp is calculated sum of all such products. Unfortunately, System.out.println(tmp) shows, that when function ends, tmp equals 0. This is very sad, because i need this variable for next calculations. What shoud I do?
@PabloB. sir, this is sad :(
I'm going crazy guys, my labels are not updated in my views after running "" and ""! This is what I tried so far: make sure there is no "" strings around in PO files delete MO files relaunch and delete all . files in my project delete browser cache change browser drop the local database and launch synchdb shout to the monitor the commands I launch are the following: Is there any sort of Django caching mechanism related to compiled MO files that I have to empty? What can I do? I'm really furious! -_-'
I have a Django application built in our shop and currently we are moving to production that will run a apache web server. The application will run on multiple webservers Due to load issues. Now, I'm really worried since it's running multiple webservers. Issue - The application generates unique ids for session management and maintains it locally. Now, if a user goes to webservers-a and creates A unique id and then in the next request goes to webservers-b he will be invalidated because the unique id created for him will be local to webservers-a. How can I fix this issue?
@Kolink Oh, I hate Facebook for many more reasons!
This seems fairly trivial but is giving me hella grief! I have a module in the lib folder. The controller. config/Application.rb And I get this error I know the module is loaded correctly. What am I doing wrong?
Beat Detection looks incredibly complicated :(
You're right edited. Sad fact! :(
It'll work, it is just incredibly annoying and spy-ware-esque.
I've changed the color scheme on sublime text 2 and I really hate the colors it changed to. So what is the name of the default settings? Because I want to change it back to the standard.
Have created a module in DotNetNuke 7. Have made changes on my local test version which has created several rows in the database. I then copied these rows into the live database but they dont appear in the live version of the module. Have tried clearing the cache through host settings and restarting the application and it still won't show new rows. Have even tried setting cache settings to non-specified and still won't load new rows. Is there a way I can completely reset and get it find the new rows. This is an extremely irritating feature.
I'm calling onto some code that returns me an HTTP response. I can get the contents of the response which returns me a byte array. The bytes represent a zip file that I would like to extract and get the contents of a single file (the zip only contains one file). Currently I have some messy code (I'll need to clean it up if I keep it) that seems to work: but was wondering whether there was a cleaner way to do the same thing because the above looks incredibly ugly.
It's technically possible to achieve this in T-SQL with nested loops and embedded queries. All hugely ugly in T-SQL. Far easier to do it in a language that's more general purpose.
I'm trying to debug my application and from the point I fire it up on the iPad, it will get killed by timeout before it ever reaches FinishedLaunching() (I have abreakpoint there)! Here' swhat I see in the output panel. All this takes almost 20s. If I run the app in RELEASE build it randomly gets stuck. I hit a button and the delegate gets caled half a minute later. What is going on? In the Simulator it is all okay.
I have been trying to use OfflineAudioContext and the FFT analyzer in chrome with a script processor but I am running into the same issue that this person has: In that SO answer, someone pointed out this bug report: but it is over a year old! My questions are: does anyone know if this will be fixed anytime soon and should I file a bug elsewhere? Is that bug report (that is a year old) still being looked at? Or better yet, maybe someone knows a workaround? My code is essentially the same as the jsfiddle on that SO link. It's really sad that this stuff doesn't work in chrome but it does in Firefox.
Excellent! Thanks for telling me about this. I'll be watching this.
In the end the answer was - yes - indeed. It was simply a delay between me adding my google test account and it actually being recognised as such :@! Google should have a warning about this - in-app billing is a complete nightmare to code!
I want to find out how long time there is till a specific from . I have searched everywhere, but can't really find anything. I THINK I have to use the -function together with the -function somehow. The scenario is: I have variable with the day of the week, ex: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 And another variable with a time of the day: hh:mm And the last variable also with a time of the day: hh:mm "How long time" could be like: "2 days, 3 hours and 27 minutes from now" The same output should be generated from a specific datetime. Ex: 06/08/2012 23:55 is "1 day and 13 minutes from now" I really hope you guys can help! :)
Excellent, thanks very much!
I'm very worried about the following screen. When i launch "Instruments" in Allocations mode, i see every image of my app adding to "Living". I really don't understand how it could be possible...
Great, excellent links. Thanks for the help!
I guess I could do that. It's just a pain when in Microsoft Word I can hold down shift and drag to do this, but I can't in Visual Studio!
I understand not liking XAML, as it really intimidated me at first, but I will quickly say that it is a powerful tool. I am not sure how to do it through the designer, but in C# let's say you name your DataGrid 'myDataGrid' and your List is named 'stringList'. It is as simple as the following: and the data grid is now bound to your string list.
So I have also ran into this problem. I have found a solution(it's terrible, be warned!) Open Unity and load your solution in MonoDevelop 4.0.1 (older version you can set the target framework more easily) Navigate to your project directory and open "Assembly-CSharp-vs" in notepad. Change the line "TargetFrameworkVersion" v3.5 to "TargetFrameworkVersion" v4.0 You will have to do these steps every time you load Unity(blah) but it does work.
Very useful question and an excellent answer ! Thanks
I was getting the same error when I tried to submit a version update from the Organizer. What solved my issue was using the Application Loader found in the directory /Developer/Applications/Utilities. You'll need to compress your .app file and send the corresponding .zip file. I used this for my initial submission as well, I just thought I'd try the new way. What a pain! Go with Application Loader.
Excellent question! I know this is an old post, but it saved me on a big project I am working on... so, thanks!
I am looking to create my own gestures for my iPad app. I know this can be done but don't know where to start. I read that there is some sample code that can store your custom gestures so you can re use them. Think it was as ajson I'm looking to draw numbers as custom gestures but any sample code/tutorial where I can get an idea where to start I would be very great full! Thanks ahead.
Excellent! @vinay-kr-sharma , but i add some more code to put my month language
Too slow and I prefer to operate in the same mode as my users. Also, I just really hate switching to debug. And its a waste of diskspace.
@KunalK: excellent ! worked for me . If you put this as answer then I can accept it . And it will helpful in future .
$('li:nth-child(3), li:nth-child(4)').insertAfter('ul').wrapAll('')You can't "break a list". You can either A) remove it and replace it with two lists B) extract some elements to make another list with. The following is terrible terrible practice, but then again so is what you're asking...
For anybody else that is looking for a great tutorial, the is absolutely excellent. It gave me the background for the way an MVC application is designed, and enough to start making my own applications and research to fill in the blanks. Highly recommend this tutorial.

Since I've been working with the built-in Microsoft Charting Controls in .NET 4.0 lately (and loving every minute of it!), I thought I'd take a crack at answering my own question...
I finally had success passing data through AJAX and returning it in JSON. However, now I don't know how to display it on my page. here is my JS: after my model runs, it echos the following as discovered in firebug: any advice on how to replace the div "board" with data from the returned JSON array would be incredibly helpful!
Excellent job including the Fiddle! I still can't quite understand the question though. Could you include the output?
Excellent news, good stuff!
Check out this though personally I recommend you the backbone - it's very agile and fast to learn + leaves you with a lot of freedom and happiness :) But imo the special thing about the backbone compared to others is the community - and no fancy feature can replace that!
@btevfik..thats very sad:(
From netstat -anp | grep I at two different times, I can see HttpClient is not re-using my connections. I connect to the same host every time with different urls such as Why is HttpClient not just re-using the same connection to myhost.com every time? I have the following code for intialization of the Pool that I pass to HttpClient... I see they are using an HttpRoute and have localAddress in the equals which seems odd as HttpRoute should be equal on just hostname and schema(https/http) and that is it, right? Does that have something to do with it? Is this a bug? Performance is very crappy having to re-establish https sockets every time!!!!!

I have a VB.NET MDI WinForms app. My users have been complaining about form creep (as they call it), this is where each time you open a specific form within the main MDI window it opens slightly below and to the right of the location it loaded previously - i.e. it starts in the top left of the window and works its way down to the bottom right. I have to agree with them that this is extremely irritating, is there any way to prevent this? The code to load the forms is: I can address this somewhat by setting the forms start-up positions to 'Manual' but then they just open directly on top of each other in the top left of the screen. Any other SO users come across this?
I'm using this practice to add comments using AJAX , by sending the data to an ASP.NET Handler which collect the information and then insert the comment, but I am afraid that any one could use it , am I wrong !?
It's the most ugly :( :( :(

I have some questions.. (See an image for more information here: .) 1.When the animation plays reverse, i want it to play faster.. Is there any way I can do this? By code maybe? 2.Also. When the animation played backwards, and then forewards again I want it to stop at 'mouseover'. How can I do this? If i put a trigger stop between them, it also stopt when it is playing backwards. I really hope someone knows how to do this! Thankyou, Kind regards, Ellen
Nope... doesn't fix it I'm afraid!
Now I think it is not possible in c++ (without explicitly qualifying the namespace), it's so sad :(
Extremely good question! For *line 1*, it is because you cannot add anything to a list of unknown type except `null`.
Excellent! On a Mac as well... I'll look into railsapi.com. Thank you for your help!
I have this script and been breaking my head on trying to change it so that instead of cropping the center part of the image it will crop from the top to the $height sent to the function, any help will be extremely great:

You've probably installed VS2010 SP1.
The function is written to expect an array, but you're passing it an integer. Did you mean ? (That does at least print a list of numbers, but I'm afraid many of them are not primes!)
@Jakub nope, theres 21. Look at Jon's answer. The file names are lying!

The objective of my endeavour is to have a linux computer execute a command (or maybe a local script - on the target) over a local network. Ideally, I would use SSH to do this but unfortunately my embedded target is running WinCE which is absolutely horrible. To do this, I would require an SSH server running on WinCE. I looked into the OpenSSH port but it doesn't work and development for that stalled six years ago. To wrap up, I am looking for an alternative solution to using SSH on WinCE. So, any ideas?
I modified your code and here is a working Downloader class. (@SÃ©bastienNussbaumer improved this answer and @TobiasKienzler reviewed changes: thanks a lot guys!) Simple to use: Output when download complete: Enjoy:-) And the event class:

I have just about finished adding all of the content to each page of my website. I've noticed, however, when I navigate between links some of the pages shift to the right about 10 px or so. This is extremely irritating. All of my pages are contained within the same container using a fluid grid. However, not all pages have the same amount of content. I noticed that pages with empty divs don't shift when I navigate between them. However, if I navigate from a page with content to a page with little or no content, I see the shift. Should this be happening if all of my pages are using the same container, same fluid grid? Does this make sense? Can you sense my desperation?
@JonSkeet Boy you really hated my edit.
How can i get? My attempt was:
I just started practicing TDD in my projects. I'm developing a project now using php/zend/mysql and phpunit/dbunit for testing. I'm just a bit distracted on the idea of encapsulation and the test driven approach. My idea behind encapsulation is to hide access to several object functionalities. To make it more clear, private and protected functions are not directly testable(unless you will create a public function to call it). So I end up converting some private and protected functions to public functions just to be able to test them. I'm really violating the principles of encapsulation to give way to micro function testability. Is this the correct way of doing it?
Thanks for posting this Rob! Excellent work (saved me a month of R&D)!
Oh God, I remember this, it was absolutely horrible. Worse, I can't remember how to fix it offhand.

Our QA team uses HP Quality Center for defect tracking, test plans, etc. The dev team really detests Quality Center and wants to use JIRA for internal task tracking. Can these two systems work seamlessly together? I have worked on projects where 2 teams used separate issue-tracking systems and keeping them in sync was a major headache. Anyone have real-world experience integrating Quality Center and JIRA?

I'm a new user to the site, and new to VBA. I'm just trying to get the contents of multiple text boxes (from many different sheets) into one sheet. Right now, I've been stuck on getting the information from a single text box into a variable. At this point in time, I just want it to retain the line feeds (new line, enter, return, etc). Even if I could just copy/paste the information, at this point, I can't even access the text box via VBA. If anyone could help out, that'd be really great! Thanks.

You already have a great answer, but I wanted to give you a resource so you don't actually have to install IE8. You can use this site to test IE6-9, FF2-4, Chrome 5-6, Safari 3-5, and Opera 9-10. It's a really excellent tool!

This isn't really a coding question, but I wanted to ask about what is more efficient and what should I use. I am making a tutorials website, and each tutorial is brought up onto a page "blog.php" on which all data comes from the database. Now I have two ways I can fill in the meta keywords tag and meta description tag. I was thinking of making 2 new columns in the blogs table, keywords, and description, and the meta tags would be filled up correspondingly from the database, and the database would get the keywords and description from user input (whover wrote the blog). I know how I would do this but is this efficient? Because I heard search engines have a harder time reading stuff from the database, so I wanted to make sure. So I can use that OR do you recommend that I use JQuery to get text from the title tag and use that type of stuff? It would be really great because I was hoping to use PHP to make it dynamic, but if I should use Jquery and javascript then please tell which is better! Thanks!

XCode 5.0 Console Not Showing After Exiting App and Reopening. I put a simple NSLog in the next screen that I push to and there is no logging of it in my console. This makes it a pain to debug! I segue from one screen to a tabbar controller, if that helps? Has anyone encountered this issue?
If you're really worried about the if statement, you have a Stateful object. This class delegates the work to a object which is either a or a object. The object will actually load. The will not load. Note that there are no if-statements.
I have an Android app that looks absolutely horrible if the user sets their font size to large or extra large (via Settings -> Display -> Font size in Ice Cream Sandwich). It just plain wasn't designed for variable font sizes, and it makes a lot of the text unreadable. I've seen applications that preserve the font size for most views, so I know that there has to be a way to do this. Is there a simple way for me to tell the application to ignore the user's font size preference? And if there isn't, how would you suggest that I go about calculating the font sizes? If nothing else, is there a way for me to retrieve the user's font size preference?
Wow, great link!
Probably the date format does not match the string and `dateFromString` is `nil`. - Single-stepping in the debugger (and inspecting the variables) can be extremely helpful!

In VS 2008, there are XML code snippets that seem to be pretty awesome :) However, it seems that the snippets we created do not indent properly. For example if we have the following code: We get something like: Is there any way to make it so that all lines keep the same indentation?
I recommend VirtualBox. Every time I use VPC I soon give up because the performance is terrible. I run VirtualBox with a Vista virtual PC allocated 1.5gb ram and it runs really well. In fact I don't really notice much slow down from running natively.
Because the table design is wrong. If it can't be changed, that's short-sightedness and you'll have to suffer by using sub-optimal SQL. A table change is a one-time cost which can be amortized, sub-optimal queries cost every time you use them.
How do I pull a single column of data out of a filled dataset? I have a filled dataset object, with a variety of tables. I need to get all of the data that is stored in a particular column in one of the tables, and bind a ComboBox ItemSource to it. (This may require me to pull the data out and make it into a string collection ...) If anyone has any bright ideas, it would be very grateful!

How to print multiply flowdocumets in a batch? Following code should print different documents but print the same. This sample works pretty fine only if you print to the xps printer.
Hey guys. I told my wife all options that you gave and she went for "As Required", says it sounded more formal to her, and although Unspecified matches the scenario too, she didn't like how it looked on the agreement. Couldn't mark your answer as preferred since you put it as a comment ceejayoz. But, really thank you all for the very quick answers and taking the time to help!
The indexes you need are dictated by your query requirements, not your schema design.
I'm working with JBoss 6.1 and just hit this issue. There's no emptySessionPath option in my server.xml. So, how can this be done for version 6.1?
For the record, .Net Framework 3.5 SP1 is required for Microsoft SQL Server 2008 to install and RTM'd around the same time as the release this week. Still a hefty install but you can extract the client profile from it. Just not to sure how.

Indeed, this is awful. A pity there is no option to change it. Every other IDE/editor I used opened tabs to the right.
If you're doing a git merge of a bunch of files and this is all you have to worry about, you have nothing to worry about.
How does one make M-( the default behavior for typing an opening "(" character? I want Emacs to automatically insert the closing ")" after the cursor when I type a "(" character regardless of whether it's part of an M-key combination. Additionaly, I want to extend this behavior to quotes, subquotes, brackets and braces. Typing M-( is a pain, and there don't appear to be any comparable forms for those other characters.
While this could work when I'm developing and debugging the solution, I'm afraid it wouldn't work once the solution is deployed and a user needs to change the settings.
Also, make sure the mouse is using VMware drivers. Sometimes it reverts to general PS/2 drivers, which can cause very irritating lag.
Actually, I've just fixed it. Fiddled with ColorBox and got it working. I'm running it in a function every time the images change, which didn't seem to work with the previous lightbox plugin but does with this one. Hurray!
For you guys who can't find the 'Documents and Settings' (whatever reason there may be) here is another path where the trusted.certs can be found: Hope this helps!
Excellent - Cool
path/to/build/dir/libtool --mode=execute gdb path/to/executable. I think libtool is an effective and terrible solution.
It doesn't appear to be possible.
No, I'm afraid not
This could be terribly trivial, but I'm having trouble finding an answer that executes in less than n^2 time. Let's say I have two string arrays and I want to know which strings exist in both arrays. How would I do that, efficiently, in VB.NET or is there a way to do this other than a double loop?
I just have to say this is a brilliant idea, love it! +1
I abhor debugging a `forEach` loop. Step in, step out. It's so much easier to just debug a `for` loop;
The operative word in your question being "I". When _I_ step through... it works. When _I_ double click... it works. When _Windows_ runs... it doesn't work.
Link is down again.
I for checking whether the function exists yet. In summary: Does that work for you? If it does then you can just wrap in a loop. A bit less nasty than a setTimeOut!
i thought the question said 'specifically in SQL Server 2005'?
I want to copy a file from A to B in C#. How do I do that?
I've seen this bug in resharper 4.1. It happens when the base class is in the App_Code directory. Don't know how to fix it, very annoying, code still compiles though.
It appears that Microsoft is aware of this issue and they have ... I don't know if this was addressed in IE8 B2... you might try it and see. Good luck!
great question!
You should really take a look at sprox ( ). It builds on RESTController, is very straight forward, well documented (imo), generates forms and validation "magically" from your database and leaves you with a minimum of code to write. I really enjoy working with it. Hope that helps you :)
-1 This is due to omitting "var" before "a" making it global and is unrelated to the question.
Wide lines are a #@$# in most diff'ing tools as well, which can make code reviews a pain.
If the files were never committed and they're no longer on the hard drive, then I'm afraid they're probably gone, unless your user has manual backups, or some other recovery/undeletion strategy works out.

Ugh, indecent exposure of mod_rewrite should be a crime. Put a bathrobe on it, or something.
Filip is both correct and incorrect, at least wrt to Java and ASP.NET. An applet can get access to the ASP.NET session by cheating. In my case, we added the session id as a parameter to the applet, which the applet then adds as a cookie in it's requests. Seems to work ok. (We encrypted the session id to foil those nasty hacker folk!)
Maybe, but that's not what he asked. He was worried instead about losing a pointer to that particular location in memory, which is a dubious concept in Python anyhow.
I was using ruby and glade2 to design the user interface for a while in the new version of glade3 i can use gtkbuilder format to generated xml file instead of libglade. is there any example? i searched google but i had no luck!

Wow, thanks for the answers! This helps a lot.
Malice? Seriously though, it's hard to account for formatting style sometimes. It's largely a matter of personal taste. Personally, I think that both forms are a little nasty unless you're seriously restricted in terms of line-length.

Any suggestions to what I'm doing wrong here? Cheers

Background: The MSMQ is hosted on Windows 2003. The queue that will receive the messages is a public queue. I have installed MSMQ HTTP Support on the server. From some of the white papers on MSDN, it appears that you can insert messages into MSMQ using SOAP/XML. The process, however, of just finding the WSDL endpoint is not clear to me. Any help you could offer would be greatly appreciated! Wish you the best!
Can anyone think of a quick, easy and fullproof way of listing only ClearCase Remote Client views from UNIX? ct lsview obviously lists all the views, and you could search by looking at the Properties: section if you run a ct lsview -properties -full (gives you Properties: snapshot webview readwrite) then use a regex or something, but I'd be worried that someone calls their view 'webview' or something. Has anyone got a foolproof way? Am I missing a flag or something? If only there was -fmt on lsview :S

I want to be able to grab content from web pages, especially the tags and the content within them. I have tried XQuery and XPath but they don't seem to work for malformed XHTML and REGEX is just a pain. Is there a better solution. Ideally I would like to be able to ask for all the links and get back an array of URLs, or ask for the text of the links and get back an array of Strings with the text of the links, or ask for all the bold text etc.
Using Rails, is there a reason why I should store attachments (could be a file of any time), in the filesystem instead of in the database? The database seems simpler to me, no need to worry about filesystem paths, structure, etc., you just look in your blob field. But most people seem to use the filesystem that it leaves me guessing that there must be some benefits to doing so that I'm not getting, or some disadvantages to using the database for such storage. (In this case, I'm using postgres).
but i'm afraid the cacheobject would get gc'ed not the data it caches.
Wrote it down for you, hope it works as you expected!
Great! Thank you.
but stackoverflow is awesome!
Excellent Answer :-)
As said by Gawie below, this is all mapped to a command named "View.ShowSmartTag". Instead of using an uncomfortable shortcut, you can find the command and remap it to something that makes sense to you!
XmlSimple is a part of Rails, but it's not dependent on Rails. You can install it into Ruby without installing all of Rails by using `gem install xml-simple`.
If you don't mind working at a slightly lower level, httplib2 () is an excellent HTTP library that includes caching functionality.

I have an .ico file with 5 icon sizes embedded in it being used as the main application icon and the System Tray icon. When it shows up in the task bar the icon is using the 16x16 format which is desired. When the icon shows up in the Notification Area/System tray, it is using the 32x32 format and Windows is rendering it down to a 16x16 icon, which looks horrible. How do I force windows to use the 16x16 icon size in the notification area? Here's my code to put the icon in the system tray:
To get the width of the image you can use this code: You could use this in the document preamble to create a new command to automatically set the width: and then, in your document: I hope this helps!

Yes, as a number of the excellent responses spotted, it is (was) a homebrew fiber implementation - my first implementation of Flow-Based Programming on a PC. The 16-bit version was actually used for production work at a big US company. I didn't realize that Win32 has a fibers implementation - I'll read the article cited by Greg Hewgill. Thanks to all of you!

I'm developing a propietary (non Open Source) Web Application in ASP.NET, and I want to use the Look And Feel of Joomla (images, control distribution, etc.). Is this illegal? I'm violating the license doing this?
The fact that this is even remotely possible in JavaScript scares me.

It's not a place, but I've found by Charles Petzold excellent. It covers everything you ask about and is focused specifically on WPF/silverlight. Of course Petzold (as usual) is able to communicate the important concepts beautifully.
I've run into this problem a couple times now. Last time, I wanted to create an array of arrays (matrix) of BOOL's. I ended up encapsulating them in NSStrings, because apparently NSArray only has arrays of objects. This time, want an array of arrays again, but of CGPoints. I'm going to be using these to draw images to the screen. Is there a way to create an array of CGPoints without them being objects? Should I even worry about the memory/performance overhead of having a matrix of 96 objects?
Thanks! This looks very promising!
In VB.NET 4.0, most of you probably know you don't need to explicitly write getters and setters for your Property declarations as follows: VB automatically creates private member variables called _Foo and _Foo2. It seems as though Microsoft and the VS team have adopted the _ convention, so I don't see an issue with it.

An alternative to recording would be to use the MS Speech API with C#, enter the words via keyboard, and have it state what was keyed in. Just a thought... Good luck on your app -- it sounds like a really cool program!
struct.unpack() returns a tuple. That is why there is a comma at the end of the float. To get the float out of there just ask for the index.
Indeed, but OP asked for a character not a substring. Of course if you interpret character broadly to include multibyte characters, `strstr` is the right function to use.
We have a servlet hosted on jboss which works on HttpServletRequest. But sometimes we receieve requests that do not get decoded by jboss, and when we do getQueryParam on HttpServletRequest, we get null. The jboss access log shows the url in encoded form. Normally, when everything works smooth, url is shown decoded in access log. e.g.: This was a problematic request: This was a proper request: Could we be missing some jboss decode settings, or is it just a case of malicious user?

Wow! I have an idea of cool web 2.0 app, and i will share it with you now.

Pity you haven't said what you are monitoring for. You should decide whether 15 seconds is ok or not.

I'll add another sugestion: "iotop", for answering a "who is thrashing the HDD" questions.
I know this doesn't answer your question directly, but it might be worth checking out the SQL Server 2005 migration tool for Access. I've never used the tool, but it might be worth using with SQL Server 2005 Express Edition to see if there are the same issues as you had with MySQL

Make it work with all browsers up front. This will mean extra testing during development but will cause you less pain later.

I have an existing javascript/flash -interaction kludge that sucks terribly. Now I've decided it'd be better to write a flash app that does the specific thing without the need to interact with javascript. Therefore I'd need to produce flash apps in linux, and I don't have money to throw at adobe right now (perhaps never if their software keeps being terrible). Also not going to do software development on windows, have been there, conclusion: that's not going to work well ever. So, any solutions? Free or open source?
The whole purpose of J# is to ease the transition of Java developers to the .NET environment which didn't work so well (I guessing here) so Microsoft dropped J# from Visual Studio 2008. For your question, "Is there a real benefit of using J#?".. in a nutshell... No..

This is probably silly but very frustrating. Using VS2008 with a C++ project, when I'm working normally, the breakpoints window is visible and active but when I'm debugging it disappears and can't be shown.

Pressing the breakpoints window button doesn't do anything and neither does pressing Ctrl+Alt+B Does this happen to anybody else? It's a brand new install with Visual Assist and QT integration as extensions. same configuration with VS2005 doesn't have any problems.

Also is there a more efficient way than comparing the year month and day parts of a Date object?
I do hate the plain id name. I strongly prefer to always use the invoice_id or a variant thereof. I always know which table is the authoritative table for the id when I need to, but this confuses me What's worst of all is the mix you mention, totally confusing.

Like others I'm using larger fonts, since getting on the plus side of fifty. Most recently I started using the Consolas typeface and have really enjoyed it. Fixed width indents well. The clear differences between lowercase L and number 1 and the letter O and zeronumber 0 for example also makes this a really good programming font.

Is there a way I can compile them down?
This is simple I hope :) When I create a new web application in WSS does it need to be on port 80 if I want to point an external domain name at it? Everything is standard in terms of IIS and ports that are open i.e. port 80 is the only one open. I am guessing if I let WSS assign a port number to the new web application surely this can never be accessed externally unless I open the assigned port? Cheers
Would it help to create a View in your database that excludes the blob, and then generate your dbml from the view? It's not too terribly different from your second option, but keeps the changes mainly in the database itself, without requiring any changes to your existing table structure.
Don't use it. I hate std::pair exactly for this reason. You never know which is which, and since access to first and second are public you can't enforce contracts either. But after all, it's a matter of taste.

i think that scope of 'killed' is ok.
Here's the current code I am using. The above code works perfect in making vertical (top to bottom) gradients but I'd like to be able to make horizontal ones as well. I have a very good understanding for PHP, but I don't deal with PHP image functions very often. If someone can help me and figure this out I'd really appreciate it!
That link is full of horrible advice.
I've created an Ant task to compile VB6 applications. After some preprocessing of the source files, I start with the appropriate parameters using But when I press Ctrl+C while Ant is running, the script and my task are terminated but the spawned process is still running. How can I automatically terminate the process I started when the Ant script gets terminated? What exactly happens if I press Ctrl+C? Is my task killed immediately or is there some way to react?
@startec The question was about 4-byte floats. Which string ends with a comma? Only the tuple from `struct.unpack` has a comma.

I have the following code: This code causes python to go in an infinite recursive loop, and the output is actually incredibly cool: This keeps growing exponentially :) Its pretty but why is this happening?
Does anyone have a recommendation for an excellent reference on Microsoft's ReportViewer (VS 2008 flavour) when used in local mode? I'm currently using it but parts of it are a bit of a black box so I'd like to read up on the entire subject. Especially want to start using sub-reports to display more complex parent-child reports. I'm assuming they work in a similar mode to Crystal Reports with which I'm reasonably familar. Thanks, Rob.
I am working on an opensource app that using SubSonic 2.0.3 I need to regenerate some of the code so I need the tool that does that. I cannot find this version 2.0.3 of the code generator executable. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
@John Saunders: ok thanks. The only reason to ask you was that you seemed to be pretty knowledgeable, so I thought what the hey! I didn't mean to break any SO rules here.
That's what I meant. He needn't worry about the response being returned....you are correct about the HTTP Proxy.
My problem with Boost (here, and elsewhere) is that you can often get on without it (in this case with C++11 or before C++11 [with a function](http://stackoverflow.com/a/138633/111307)). Boost adds a significant compile time overhead, had tons of files to park into your repository (and to have to copy around/zip/extract if you are making an archive). That's the reason I try not to use it. I know you can choose what files to include/not include, but you usually don't want to have to worry about Boost's cross dependencies with itself so you just copy the whole thing around.
You really should look at an NIO framework like or . I've used MINA with great success in an enterprise chat server. It is also used in the chat server. Grizzly is used in Sun's JavaEE implementation.
Another good reason is relative longevity. db40 is an excellent product for what it does, but its user base is small and it isn't likely to outlive something like SQL Server. Of course, I also used to say there was no way Java was going to survive.
Yeah - my solution to this was to limit IE users - they can only select a tiny subset of the rows and columns that FX and Chrome users can. Even then IE8 only just copes with maybe 25 cells (5x5 grid), 7 and 6 remain hopeless. It brings back memories of late 90s web development and is an ugly thing to do, but what else can you do if their browser is so poor?
In addition to the great LINQ-implementation of Dean, I had fun wrapping the code into an extension for DependencyObjects: This makes it extremely nice considering reuseablity.
Just wondering; do you hate the string variable type?
Derek, I'm familiar with the *beforefieldinit* "optimization" but, personally, I never worry about it.

Wow I frickin love this site! Thanks for the quick and concise responses. I plan to keep the client-side regex validation but move the username check to the server-side on submit.
Has anyone ever made a sharepoint lookup column that allows fill inn choices and does writeback to the list it does lookup from? what would it take to make such a column? If a 3.rd party solution is arround that would be realy great to :) Cheers!
Fair enough: if your JDK upgrade messes up Serializable, the clients of the your big boy JDK (i.e. Sun, BEA, IBM, etc.) should scream bloody murder (and I have). Admittedly the question wasn't clear whether it was only about JDK classes.
I knew about the _viemurc/.viemurc file, but I didn't realize you could map commands to VS ones with vsc. Very good tip!
IMHO multi-core processors are still so rare, and threading is such a horrible and hairy and dangerous place to go, that you're just better off sticking to one thread.
I've been using for a little while now, but there's one glaring piece of functionality that is either missing or I just can't figure out (I hope the latter!). If you pass cfg.getTemplate() an absolute path, it just doesn't work. I know you can specify a template directory, but I can't afford to do that, my use case could deal with files in any directory. Is there any way to set FreeMarker to render absolute paths the way any user would expect?
The first time I load the website in the production web server, it start very slow, subsequent pages load very quickly (included the home page). I precompiled the site, but nothing changes. I don't have any code at Application start. I don't have cached items. Any ideas? How can I find out what is happening?

I've found the following macros pretty useful! So you can just call or from within your app (as long as the header is included of course!).

We'll eventually use Code Contracts when .NET 4.0 ships. However, in our production code right now we have had great success with a "Guard" class along with common way to generate exceptions. For more details, see .
You might want to check out the and methods. I'm afraid the method for array objects performs a shallow comparison, and does not properly (at least for this case) compare the inner arrays.
I want to format a XML document during unmarshal with JAXB. Unmarshal looks like: While marshaling one can format the code via: But this isnÂ´t possible for the unmarchal process...

FlexUnit is pretty awesome - Also ASUnit - They are both pretty similiar and both haven taken quite a bit from frameworks like JUnit. FlexMonkey () although I haven't used it myself seems to do UI unit testing.
I'm trying to build 3 packages, A, B and C. A defines some base classes that are used in B and C. I've got all 3 of them in the same project group, all set up to output to the same custom BPL output folder. This folder is in the search path for B and C. But when I go to build B and C, the compiler chokes on the Requires list. "Required package 'A' not found." How do I tell B and C where to find A so they'll build correctly?
I don't believe there is a general J2ME API for determining location. I do know that BlackBerry has a specific API for retrieving not only the rough 'cell' location, but also a GPS API as well. I'm afraid, at the moment, the GPS solutions are proprietary by manufacturer.
You've got to start with a custom instance of . We'd prefer to implement the simpler , but in this scenario we need access to the underlying . Then, to wire it up in the iBATIS config: Hope this helps!
Additionally you may customize the parsing behavior by providing appropriate dependency properties.
I am looking for a very fast way to filter down a collection in C#. I am currently using generic List<object> collections, but am open to using other structures if they perform better. Currently, I am just creating a new List<object> and looping thru the original list. If the filtering criteria matches, I put a copy into the new list. Is there a better way to do this? Is there a way to filter in place so there is no temporary list required?
I'd really like to know if anyone knows of a way to do this, also! I need to connect to it frequently from the server and a browser will never be an option - the server has no GUI and it should be run from cron.
Is it possible to add messages to the built-in error console of Firefox from JavaScript code running in web pages? I know that I there's Firebug, which provides a object and its own error console, but I was looking for a quick fix earlier on and couldn't find anything. I guess it might not be possible at all, to prevent malicious web pages from spamming the log?
@EBGreen - I didn't want to be guilty of "Not invented here"; if there is a pre-canned answer, I'm game.
Your code sample strikes me as a very strange design and an abuse of what properties are intended for. Why not just an instance method : Your property also returns if the key does not exist, but claims to return an , nor a .
Be careful since it's often not "morally reprehensible", but in fact illegal copyright infringement.
While this is excellent advice, as other answers state, there is a more nuanced answer in the case of an immutable, safely published map instance. But you should do that only if You Know What You're Doing.

Can someone tell me how I go about upgrading the Telerik ASP.NET controls? I am currently using the Q3 2008 release and I just recently bought the Q1 2009 SP1 release. How do I upgrade my projects? Do I need to uninstall the old one and install the new one or just install the new one? Also how do my projects get upgraded? Also, what about my projects that I have "live"? Do I just need to upload the new DLLs and and change my web.config? Any guidance would be great!
Excellent answer, worked for me.

C# syntax is so close to Java (and better in some ways) that you might as well learn C# instead of J#. And since C# is more widely used, you can easily find Java --> C# tutorials on google or check out and watch some videos.
I've got a table with a BLOB collum. What I want to do is get it to be able to pick out words and list them in order.

I'd like to be able to do it in just mysql alone, but I can use php as well. Thanks in advance, kenny

If you're using a general-purpose method which has the signature that's called from any event handler and is passed both the and , it can call , e.g., for logging events, without worrying about a null pointer exception.

This is recognized around our office as the "Ah, crap! I forgot about that." burndown:
My advice is to not even worry about it. HTML and XML, unlike most languages, are almost trivial to re-indent to any style the programmer wants. In HTML I use width-2 tabs, and regularly have sections that run off the edge of the editor window. There's not really any way to avoid that unless you just skip indenting sections of the document.
@sll: Not True... See my Edit
I can't understand where the extra bits are coming from in this article about s-boxes. Why doesn't the s-box take in the same number of bits for input as output?
You should prepare your statement only once, outside of the loop, and then bind the parameters in the loop. This is why prepared statements have bind parameters - so you can reuse the prepared statement. Hibernate does exactly this, treating all SQL as a prepared statement behind the scenes, though you can obviously abuse this if you use literal rather than bind parameters.
An excellent and elegant solution. Kudos.
I have done some research for "The bast way to insert huge data into DB with C#" then a lot of people just suggested me using SqlBulkCopy. After I tried it out and it really amazed me. Undoubtedly, SqlBulkCopy is very very fast. It seems that SqlBulkCopy is a perfect way to insert data (especially huge data). But why dont we use it at all times. Is there any drawback of using SqlBulkCopy?

We use Xceed's 3.0 DataGrid (pro version..but free version is excellent) more extensively than probably anybody. It has the flexibility to handle more things than the other grids.. in my opinion of course. Try them all, there are limitations to each.
