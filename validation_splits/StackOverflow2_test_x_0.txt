Have you tried removing 'preload' attribute? (Afraid I can't be much help otherwise!)
Ok, I find the reason: device won't answer to simple user (and doesn't matter what permissions did you ask in program manifest). You can directly speak to device only if you are root (or from kernel mode). That means you cannot use devices directly from general applications. Very sad :(
I don't understand why (Apple in this moment I'm hating you!), but ALAssetsLibrary in iOS 4.3.4 does not allow fetching in a background thread (I was running a series of in a ). I solved by creating a little wrapper using . EDIT: After a code refactoring and the upgrade to iOS 5, I finally realized that the problem is actually related to how ALAssetsLibrary works, there is no need to use . .
Hi I'm using the chrome inspector (F12) to try and analyze the z-index of a twitter bootstrap popover, and finding it extremely frustrating... Is there a way to freeze the popover (while shown) so that I can assess and modify the associated CSS? Placing a fixed 'hover' on the associated link does not cause the popover to appear.
This is an absolutely horrid wart in the API, but it's never going away.
I am working with Eclipse (Indigo) to develop C projects. When I create a new C project in a new workspace, by default the "Autosave before build" option is not set. This is extremely frustrating, as autosave is usually the default behavior in other IDE's I worked on. I change some code, build and nothing seems to go as expected - until I remember that the option is not set... Is there a way to make Eclipse open a new workspace with this option set?
I have hit this too. No solution as yet. This is very worrying though!
Compare these two methods: Aside from the method signatures (bar can declare instead of ), is there any practical difference between the two methods? To be clear: I'm aware that this is a horrible approach to exception handling, and should not be done!
This is one of the shortcomings of DGV that I absolutely hate and why I almost always bind to an IEnumerable of an anonymous type.
Your are really violating the idea of TDD if your code if doing something different for the Test. Why do you only need to change it inside the test?
FEAR!!!!!!!!!!!
put your path and your shadow in a set. apply your animation to the set and it'll affect both. a really terrible example where I move both at once.
Still printed but had that dreaded extra page! -_-
I have developed a cumulative sum function as defined below in the Haskell library Repa. However, I have run into an issue when combining this function with the transpose operation. All 3 of the following operations take well under a second: However, if I write: performance degrades horrendously. While each individual operation in isolation takes well under a second on a 1920x1080 image, when combined they now take 30+ seconds... Any ideas on what could be causing this? My gut tells me it has something to do with delayed arrays, not forcing at the right time, etc... But I do not have enough experience to track this down quite yet.
@Mario I disagree, while the answer is outrageously awful, it's still an answer.
If I have a setup project in a VS 2010 solution and I add/remove another project, or unload/reload another project any setup projects in the solution are expanded in the solution explorer. It only does this for setup projects and it is extremely annoying. Is there any way to disable this behaviour?
@MikeChristensen that's horrible :| and weird!!
Can't find any manual about changing width of taglist element size. Taglist element is wider than icons I had set. It looks really awful =( Screenshot:
My guess is that you would have to extend the classes for DataTip, to check for NULL hitData objects, to kill/stop the drawing of the display. I do not think there is a way to do that normally in FLEX. You would have to customize and override the hitData class unfortunately. What a pain!!
By the way, I agree with Henrik P. Hessel. This is a very horrible piece of code.
I had a memory crash on UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext() ... if you're creating and releasing a lot of them, you should wrap them in a fresh AutoReleasePool for each iteration. Even allowing the NSRunLoop to tick WAS NOT ENOUGH for Apple/iOS to do housekeeping on garbage lying around from this. e.g.
i am currently having some difficulties trying converting a Unicode character string (DT_WSTR) into an INT this is what i have (Note most writings are in German, but i think someone who has worked with SSIS will unterstand anyways) Data Type selected: A four-byte, unsigned integer.but all it does is fail terribly
yes it does it in IE8 as well. Very annoying !
Out of all that pseudocode, the only thing that really worries me is "extracts code samples from file". Reading files from a directory is trivial, saving a file is trivial. Regardless of the test framework I'd spend most of my time focusing on the parsing bit. For direct testing, I'd embed the snippets directly into the test case: Ah, I see another change I subtly made while writing the test: my ExamplesToCode.parse() returns an Array (or other iterable container), so that it can be tested apart from the iteration itself.
as you can see folks hate spending time giving details on bad advice!
sounds scary !!
Back in the day I had to solve this with a panel where the text box is a component inside and had DockPadding set to 3 or 4 pixels. I'd then style that panel to a single pixel. I always found this really annoying!
the two are not mutually exclusive, archmage.
That's what I thought...but I'm terrible with C. Absolutely terrible.
That's really sad...
If I delete this question will it increase my reputation? 5 down votes it really sad.
Shameeeee on me!!!
I need from document object or from a DOM element (i.e. a DIV) to know which is its window object. In Firefox I can do: but obviously in that AWFUL browser that statement not work!!!
I have a fairly large codebase with several directories and files and I would like to check out a view or have a view as of a given date (Septermber 12th). I am manually checking file histories and doing and this is extremely painful. I wonder if there is a way to do a checkout and load everything as of a particular day at once?
After I changed my windows regional setting from my native language to USA, the problem has gone. Do not forget to restart Visual Studio. really annoying problem !
It's impossible to receive unicast UDP packets in Silverlight (rage!!!).
yeah, compiled, but output is so horrible !!!
I agree with this. For *non-essential services* increasing timeouts is incredibly frustrating.
There's an error here: $r3 only has one result column (which you haven't given a name). Are you sure you are using the correct variable because there's no way that your code should work as you have posted it. Also your variable naming is really awful. Use meaningful names instead of , , etc...
OK, then, no solution that going DB mysql... so sad ! :-( i will close the question !
@Aggieboy that's really sad, and I have to hand-code stuff .
The 0x1A byte is a terrible, painful [source of agony](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12483711/serialdata-eof-circumstances).
This does seem to be the answer. Absolutely terrible API design.
That is awful advice! I don't mean to be overtly mean but I lolled.
Oh, absolutely horrible practice. But still the answer he was looking for.
Effective, but what a pain! You'd think there'd be an easier way.
Putting data in the ID is a terrible, terrible idea.
avoid the auto method, to apply by hand is such painful :(
You must be a sad sad person...
Somewhat new to OOP (i.e. C programmer converting to C++) and cannot figure out why my data members in my backpack class are empty. I make pass an array of potions to my backpack, yet the data members are saying mType = "" (i.e. nothing). I have never felt this lost in a program before. Starting to hate OOP (i.e. kidding...but this extremely frustrating). main.cpp potion.cpp backpack.cpp
Tools -> Options -> Projects & Solutions -> Build and Run "On Run, when projects are out of date:" Select "Always Build" That's it, had it myself, extremely annoying.
I got to this question via the Almighty Google. To complement on what Andrew said above, for those of you on OSX you might want to take a peek at /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/Resources/vim/runtime/indent/html.vim and the modifications necessary should become evident. I can't believe I spent so much time suffering from poorly indented <li>s!
From my experiences so far, I've concluded that the HTML5 Manifest scheme was really terribly designed. My site serves a manifest file when a user is logged in. Unfortunately, when they log out, they can still access the cached protected materials. Can anyone think of a way to fix this?
Tried it again - it worked. God I hate reporting services!
Someone is scared to tell the reason of -1 !
Although, using this outside testing is a horrible, horrible idea...
Can I fix the width and the height of jQueryMobile dialog? Currently, the size of width is 100% which is really awful in iPad.
Maybe someone knows how to disable content assist only on 'else' keyword when working with PHP source editor in Aptana? As I really, really hate it with this keyword, because after newest release it's really messing with my workflow as after entering 'else' and pressing enter it replaces it with: and sometimes it decides to get rid of indents completely. Mind you I don't want to disable content assist completely, I just want to disable it for 'else' keyword.
I have just started using Vim in a terminal (PuTTY or MinTTY), after always using gVim. However, when using syntax highlighting, rather than the actual text colour changing appropriately, its background is changed to whatever colour -- and it looks horrible! I've set my terminal to use 256 colours and downloaded a 256 colour colour scheme. I checked that the and settings are as I expect, but I still get this problem... Is this a Vim or a terminal configuration issue?
I am developing a web page which embedded a "Google maps" view. In this web page, the user must specify several positions on the maps At this time, I am able to spread the balloons on the map displayed when the user click on a button to be dragged, but according to the zoom it can be very painful to zoom in and out to drag the balloon to a place. I would like to know if it could be possible to have a panel with all balloons to drag/drop on the map? My current development : My target :
Talking about feelings.. I really hate the asp.net CalendarExtender..
Horribly inefficient! It re-encodes the image each time. Try this instead.
Oh, this was was a pain! I probably lost 2 hours on this. Here is the solution: CMake uses short 'C' applications to test/try things. If the CMakeLists.txt states that C++ is used for the project, without also listing C, then some of those shorts tests incorrectly fail, and cmake then thinks those things aren't found. The solution was to change the first line of CMakeLists from this: ...to include C as a language: Then delete , recreate it, and everything then works:
I am building the Android OS on Mac OSX (Lion), and Eclipse as an IDE. I am trying to understand certain parts of the OS however this requires performing many searches throughout the project. These searches take 5 or 10 minutes on Eclipse, and the way they are presented is also extremely annoying. Also, I need a separate editor to open up the native files found in the OS, since if they are opened in Eclipse there is no color coding of the C++ syntax. I feel that Eclipse is really slowing me down - can anyone suggest a better IDE for browsing the Android OS (preferably free)?
I recently worked on a product that was targeted to .NET 3.5. Out of hundreds of beta testers, I can probably count on one hand the number that already had .NET 3.5. The rest had to sit through the absolutely painful .NET 3.5 install from microsoft (~30 minutes, and most of the time the progress bar stays near 0 so people think it is broken).
I wish I'd have found this question yesterday, as it has been causing me grief for hours! Surely this is a bug with the emulator?
I'm doing one app which requires AJAX call on almost every user interaction possible, I started writing JS functions, webservices etc. to handle all of that(still long way to go from here). Now I am wondering If I made a mistake maybe I should put whole page in update panel because I really hate writting JS. Is there some drawback to use it instead of custom written ajax calls to web service and js functions, and is it better to use more update panels or one big?
The problem was due to a malfunctioning . Very painful and a lot of time wasted.
I'm trying to do this in a makefile and it fails horribly: do you know why? I guess it has to do with escaping, but what and where?
the problem that I am having is while designing an email to be sent to users the border of the HTML table is not disappearing even though it is set to 0 and so leaves horrible white lines through areas which are menu to be solid blue colors, below is my HTML code! Untitled Document
ps really hate the response limits on comments.
clicking the zoom (or pan) button again, restores it. terribly silly - yes!
done... stackoverflow makes you wait several minutes. I really hate that
@Rob same problem, nothing. very disgusting
Why do you need the class explicitly? Couldn't you use the interface? Note that casting is not encouraged, which is why it looks so awful in Scala!
I have a page running on my local django dev server with the Django Debug Toolbar that seems to be running quite slowly but I'm unsure why: Django Debug Toolbar says SQL - 46 queries in 39.80ms And then running a profiler I get 7926 function calls (7774 primitive calls) in 0.024 seconds So I'm left wondering why is the profile time so much lower than the Total CPU Time? And then how can I find out what's causing the difference? And secondary to that - should i be worried about the 16842 involuntary context switches!?
It sounds very scary to me to use a floating point number for a key in a `map`.
Ahw... that's plain sad :(
Extending the class to handle new tags or syntax is not a bad idea, but eval'ing inline ruby code from a possibly untrusted source is an absolutely horrible idea!
Im trying to work with this awful language and I have to change an item of list by accessing to it with index I dont understand the awful syntax of TCL! How can I realise it?
This is extremely ugly C-style code, easy to get wrong. While the bugs in your code have been fixed by earlier birds, here is the C++ way to do this:
I am working on an app that uses some basic view types, but I find the default attributes extremely ugly in Android (for example, a bright yellow ). I can get the basic seekbar if I create it from code, using only the parameter, but I would like to know if there is a way to do this inside an XML Layout file. Is there an attribute I can set that will remove all default attributes - such as ?
@BoristheSpider :( :( That is really sad. :(
here's my hack that assumes arguments are all imaginary: ...horrible! but what you ask for isn't really possible without for instance hacking to dispatch to a new subtype of java.lang.Number. Really it would make more sense to use a Java or Clojure complex number library.
I am experiencing exactly this problem (and am in exactly the same world of pain): Whereby I am offering an update to SQL using LinqToSQL and it is failing with a because is set to . Due to legacy databases also on the server I am targeting, I am not able to re-configure the default connection settings as is quite rightly stated in the accepted answer in . My question is: How do you convince LinqToSQL to run a SQL before executing an update?
I'm currently having exactly the same issue with Monotouch and that's why I found your question. I get the very same exception as you do. This makes me assume that I'm not facing a Monotouch issue but a basic (mis)behavior of XIBs/Cocoatouch. So the answer is: no, it is not possible. Very sad though. RenÃ©
That's horrible!!
I just tried installing those missing plugins ... what a pain!
can I replace my entire windows vista with ubuntu and is it free? I really hate vista
I've been tackling the same issue. It's a pain!
Why would you do that? You're begging for horrible debugging sessions!
I found this great node mysql boilerplate: it works terrific! However, now I need to hook it in to my existing user table, and my key field is named userID, not simply id, and changing the key fieldname in mysql breaks the example. So my question is, where in the project do I need to specify a different id field name? I see user.id in /util/auth.js passport.serializeUser and id in passport.deserializeUser functions, but it seems it must be specified elsewhere too. I'm hoping this is a simple question for users of passportjs!
I'm trying to create some ads in Admob, but on last step I always get error: but it didn't specify WHERE. I swear god, there are no errors on whole page, all fields are correctly filled, I see no red shapes around fields, everything match criterias written under fields, but I stil get this error - without any explanation. Has anybody same experiences? It's totally frustrating :(
Scary question!
I'm not sure that the given approach will work with hosts using NPT/EPT.
Come on, you are worrying about efficiency while your first line of code is incorrect!
I don't see how this is possible, but I really, really hate to run my query an extra time just to get the record count so I can build a pager. When I say a "pager" I simply mean the common gizmo with a link for each 10 records for example.
I can't believe that answer from a company. Horrible!
Well, this is a bit of an awful hack but quite frankly any C++ application which needs a way to define an unconstructable object is probably already an awful hack! And under GCC, I get the following: test.cpp: In function âint main()â: test.cpp:9: error: cannot declare variable âan_instanceâ to be of abstract type âlaâ test.cpp:2: note: because the following virtual functions are pure within âlaâ: test.cpp:4: note: virtual void la::oh_no_you_dont()
Very scary! O_O
no, it is not possible -- we tried hard and ended up reverting to the 10.7 way of using a custom class.. check MAAttachedWindow well with enough swizzling and posing it'd be possible of course... but that is very evil and at least as much work as your own class!
EDIT: Also you should avoid using it can make debugging extremely frustrating.
So "options" always has one item, and "option" can have multiple? What a horrid API!

I just installed AndroidStudio in my System I am trying to create my Very First Project . I set up JAVA_HOME and Android SDK path that has been used previuosly by eclipse in Android Studio Android SDK has the below versions for Tools and Platform Android SDK Tools - 22.6.2 SDK Platform - 19 As soon as started Android studio downloaded the Gradle-1.12 in the below path C:\Users\DELL.gradle\wrapper\dists\gradle-1.12-all after that it shows the build screen as below.

I am working on a test application based on ASP.NET MVC. I am new to CSS stuff so I am learning that as well. I have created a master page called "new.master" and created a new css "new.css". I am calling the view from controller as: What I am doing is that I am frequently updating the css and master page. So I run the application in debug mode frequently. After sometime I stop seeing the effect of changes in css. When I "view source" in chrome and check the css, it shows an old version. When I change the name of both master page and css, I start to receive updated views but that works for sometime and then again I stop getting the CSS updates. Have you faced this problem? How can I fix it? (Its terribly annoying!)
I am very jealous of your name!

I am right now on a weekend, so i cant check my code on the server( been developing the basics on localhost with xampp which has latest php). Has anyone tried laravel 4 on pre-5.3.7 php?? i m very worried all of last week's work is going to the bin... :(

I have a long scrolling page, and want to test if an element is 100px from the top, then apply a class elsewhere (until the next element in line is 100px from the top) If I could just get the basic statement I would be ecstatic, anything extra would be a bonus!
Great time saver and hidden gem. Excellent!
Excellent! That makes life considerably easier. I really didn't want to add another layer to the application if I could avoid it. As far as StackOverflow etiquette goes, if I set this question as answered, Nikos won't get the rep for it as the answer is in the comments. What's the protocol?
Excellent article! Very useful :)
@Oded thank you this tool is very great!
Yep I've been testing some stuff recently under Safari 5.1.5 (WinXP) recently and when you have elements with tabindex="0", all the elements EXCEPT links ( with "href" defined) are focusable. By all elements, I mean s, s etc. It's absolutely amazing for me from the accessibility point of view!

You might want to look into JAXB. If you have a defined XML schema it will automatically create java classes that will easily allow you to 'marshal' (move data from java -> XML) and much much more. It's incredibly useful!
No worries! IE11 does a poor job of emulating other browser versions.
Well I'm kind of new with magento, and at work they ask me to do a group of products that they will be put in discount, so I created a category sales where I can link the products and put them in sale, so this is working perfectly, but the ask me to put dates in the products so the web master can put dates where the products will be shown between dates, so now I have no idea how to do this.

I'm pretty familiar with PGP, and the way it works. I'd like to include some functionality in a project, but so far my research has left my head spinning. What I'd like to do is create a public key with a defined private pass phrase. From there, I'd share the public key with someone where they can then encrypt a message using the key and return it to me where I can decrypt. I envision the code looking something like this. To generate my private pgp key: To encrypt I'd give my shared key to a friend: To decrypt the encrypted string after being sent back to me: Obviously I know I'm skipping out on a ton of details. Through my research I've seen references to libraries like Bouncy Castle and Spongy Castle. Any help would be hugely appreciated!

I've been experimenting with Linq to see what it can do - and I'm really loving it so far :) I wrote some queries for an algorithm, but I didn't get the results I expected... the Enumeration always returned empty: case #1 I changed the query declaration to be inline like this, and it worked fine: case #2 Does anybody know why it doesn't work in case #1 ? The way I understood it, the query wasn't evaluated when you declared it, so I don't see how there is a difference.
Well, I was using the setControlValueToUpperCase() method too soon it seems. So changing my keydown first if statement to fixed my issue. Horray Me!!

Thanks so much for the excellent answers! All answers worked beautifully.
Wow! It is really great answer! So helpful! Thank you very much!
That answer was extremely helpful Scott, thanks for the pointer on that!

So I'm trying to write a RR Rotation and LL Rotation with Java for an AVL tree. I have most of it figured out, however I don't know where I should modify the height within the method. I've been trying to understand it for a few days here but I cannot figure out where exactly it would go in the method I currently have. If someone could help explain exactly where I should put the modifications for the height of the node (it uses getLeft/setLeft for it's left height and getRight/setRight for it's right height) it would be extremely helpful!

I have 2 files I need to merge based on 2 columns. I have tried using awk as well as tried combining the 2 columns using _ and then using the join command.

I need someone to point me in the right direction on this.... In my Android application I have a ListView with custom views for each row containing various textviews each. I retrieve weather information for multiple locations and then want to write the results for each location to its own listview item. The question is, how do I refer to each textview on each listview item? I can't do it by name using , can I? If there are three items in the list, will the temperature textview for each item be names the same, just differ by an array index? If so, how do I specify TextViewName(0), TextViewName(1) and TextViewName (2) for the three list items? Yes, I'm still very new to Android....but loving it!

In ASP.NET MVC, I have a form. In this form the user selects a country, and then the ID is posted back to the server, using a normal . However, for some UX reasons, I use Knockout. Therefore I need to get my observable value to have the value of a dropdownlist. I want my label in the markup, to show the countryId, depending on the selected value on the dropdownlist. Markup: ViewModel: Then my question is: How do I modify my DropDownListFor, so the countryId is being set automatically? :-) Thanks a lot! I really enjoy learning Knockout, but this one has taken me a long time!
