I need urgent help with a CSS tumblr theme header found here grandneue.tumblr.com (1) Stretch: I want it to be able to stretch but only up to a maximum size as the header gets too pixelated otherwise), probably around 800px. (2) Shrink: The second issue I have is, while the header does shrink down to a certain size (it does when I change the desktop browser window and to a certain extent on the iphone5), it doesn't shrink down fully so it fits 100% on a vertical iphone5 browser display. Can anyone please help me solve these two queries? The content is totally fine so I don't understand why the header won't follow suit! Thanks very much!
We have a file named wordlist, which contains 1,876 KB worth of alphabetized words, all of which are longer than 4 letters and contain one carriage return between each new two-letter construction (ab, ac, ad, etc., words all contain returns between them): I want to create a new file that contains only words that are not derivatives of other, smaller words. For example, the wordlist contains the following words ["abuser, abused, abusers, abuse, abuses, etc.] The new file that is created should retain only the word "abuse" because it is the "lowest common denominator" (if you will) between all those words. Similarly, the word "rodeo" would be removed because it contains the word rode. I tried this implementation: But it always froze my computer. Any solutions?
You could use a : Of course this code looks extremely ugly in C#. Depending on what manipulations you are performing on those strings you could take advantage of the features built into C# to convert it into a one-liner and avoid writing all those imperative loops. This is to say that when converting source code from one language to another it's not a matter of simply searching for the equivalent data type, etc... You could also take advantage of what the target language has to offer.

It might be questionable, but not a cause for rejection as long as you have a fallback behavior when/if the method can not be found. There are worse abuses that have passed.
Overall bytes includes those that have been released and is a running total of what has been allocated to your app during the lifetime of the app. The Live Bytes is the one to really worry about as that is the one that shows bytes that are currently allocated. Overall bytes could keep going on forever as long as you release stuff and the Live Bytes doesn't go too high then you will have no problems. From that screenshot live bytes looks ok. There are more details here

I'm using the ImageMapster jQuery plugin, and I want to limit the number of selections that can be made on a (image-) map to a certain number.

Found the culprit! At first I tried the solution suggested by @billinkc in the comment, it worked (I managed to create a folder) but the folder wasn't usable as I couldn't upload packages. I have db_owner permission on the MSDB database and so I can see and access the SSIS MSDB folder. What I really needed was the db_ssisadmin permission. Not to worry as db_owner permissions allow me to give myself the db_ssisadmin permission! After this was done, all the problems (the one in the original Q and more) disappeared.
I'm trying to create a grid (matrix) of squares in a given area with n columns and m rows, and an option to set a spacing between the squares if desired. The grid should fill squares with random coloring. I'd also like to add a zoom function, so the colored squares will appear much bigger in a region that is double-clicked. Can anyone suggest a good method to generate the grid and assign random colors to the squares? If you can suggest how to create the zoom effect too that would be SUPER :) I'm new to canvas, so any method help would be great! Thanks

Some guidelines would be really helpful because I'm not sure should I even use AJAX or something else for my needs. Links for some tutorials will be also great :) Thanks a lot for any help!
I am using NHibernate mapping-by-code to map the classes.

I am new to Delphi (been programming in it for about 6 months now). So far, it's been an extremely frustrating experience, most of it coming from how bad Delphi is at handling dates and times. Maybe I think it's bad because I don't know how to use TDate and TTime properly, I don't know. Here is what is happening on me right now : That's not the exact code I use, everything is in variables and used in another context, but I think you can see the problem. Why is that calculation wrong? How am I suppose to work around this problem?

I think that's absolutely terrible practice. First of all you do not need to make the trip to the server to hide and show controls, unless you need new data. Second, any decent javascript framework will allow you to hide show controls based on the control's id, class name, or whatever css selector. Moreover using a javascript post/get to a generic handler will give you the data that you need without the postback. I'd suggest using JQuery, or some other alternative.

You DO need to modify web.xml whenever it's needed. Especially with JAX-RS, you will have to define your servlet in web.xml. I recommand you to use Maven. There are plenty of exemple in the web to do so. Good luck, JAX-RS is really great ! Maven is also nice.

A simpler approach (rather than using a binding group) is to use the default button's click event to set the focus to itself. As this happens before the command is executed it means the ViewModel is updated in time. And if you really hate code behind, you could always write an attached property...

You forgot regression tests - it is a real pain for a manual tester to run through hundreds of forms just to check for some basic stuff which could be easier done automatic. Better spare the tester this tedious stuff, so he can concentrate on the nasty testing.
Make sure the designer doesn't put anything that he thinks is fancy and well animated. Many a times, it becomes a big pain to simulate such effects in ASP.net unless you are a pro with CSS or Javascript.

I maintain an application which, during the course of two years, has constantly required new hardware to be even usable, due to the amount of new users / new data inserted. However, justifying the investiment is sometimes very hard to do. I started to wonder - how can I establish the maximum number of users a web application currently suports? I thought of using JMeter scripts but they can get really nasty to implement when having to simulate file transfers and decison trees. What do you guys use?
I need to send and receive data over serial connections (RS-232 and RS-422). How do I set up and communicate with such a connection? How do I figure out what the configuration settings (e.g. baud rate) should be and how do I set them?

This is how you find the arc length given the parameter, but finding equidistant points requires the inverse of this function.

Well, this may not be very graceful... but you can retrieve the current focused control pretty easily. So you might consider setting up a timer that asks every 1/2 second or so "Where is the current focus?"... Then you can observe changes. Example Delphi code is below; it should be pretty easy to adapt, since the real work is in the Windows API calls.

The length of a Python Unicode string in a narrow-Unicode build is the number of UTF-16 *code units*, not actual Unicode code points. Truncating and other slicing options that go by arbitrary index can indeed split a surrogate pair in half, with the result of some missing/replaced characters. On a narrow build, `unichr(0x10345)` simply fails; `len(u'\U00010345')` is `2`. This is the price you pay for easy interaction with Win32 UTF-16LE APIs. Most other environments use UCS-4 which doesn't suffer from any such problem.
We make heavy use of Velocity in our web application. While it is easy to debug the Java side of things and ensure the Velocity Context is populated correctly, it would be extremely valuable to be able to step through the parsing of the VTL on the merge step, set breakpoints, etc. Are there any tools or IDEs/IDE plugins that would make this kind of thing possible with VTL (Velocity Template Language)?

I'm afraid I don't know any answer other than to start looking around in your area for old hardware. The CPU isn't the only variable that can (usually) affect things. L1/L2 cache size, memory bus speed, memory speed/latency, hard drive speed, etc. are all significant factors in many applications.

I always try to avoid to return string literals, because I fear they aren't defined outside of the function. But I'm not sure if this is the case. Let's take, for example, this function: Is this correct code? It does work for me, but maybe it only works for my compiler (gcc). So the question is, do (string) literals have a scope or are they present/defined all the time.
I have created a VB.Net lending application for a cooperative that caters to widows. The application tracks the members' loans and payments, and is also used as an accounting system. In my first release, the users felt that showing a messagebox every time an error occurs is very annoying. My solution is to output errors in a label control. The users accepted the modification, but i feel i am doing it wrong.
Im using the AutoPersistenceModel in Fluent NHIbernate to map all my entities and that all works fine :D However, several of my objects have In the database there is a single comments table, and each entity with the above code, has its own link table to comments. At the moment what im doing is: for every entity. Is there some way i can set a convention where by all mappings to IList<Comment> are wired up automatically as manytomany with the above table name convention? Thanks Andrew
Would use double.TryParse, it has performance benefits.
"You should never use a named mutex" - never say never. If malicious code is running on my machine, I'm probably already hosed.
What are you worried about/trying to prevent ?
You made an excellent point in a comment below, @RailsSon: you want to print Â£s to display a specific currency, but employ that display using a Japanese expression for financial numbers. I find it strange that your request hasn't been implemented in the language by decoupling the `locale` module's use of currency value and that currency's display properties.
Jonathan's comment sums up my feeling. In EF4, char(1) fields come across as string, so MS obviously recognized the pain.
Wow! Yeah, I did'nt know that! Great new feature.
I'm writing an Eclipse plugin for the JDT. I need a functionality that tracks certain strings or regular expressions and possibly creates markers. I know that Eclipse already does that for //TODO comments, for example (creating task markers for them) but I'm not sure if I can use the same mechanism. I can write my own but worried it would be too inefficient and not sensitive enough to code chnanges.
This is a terrible idea, as a compact on a database already in a suspect state can lose data that would otherwise be recoverable before the compact. Compact On Close should under all circumstances be turned OFF.
Update way later: there's actually a built in function to get the current user. I think it's in nativeApplication.
FlexeLint is a commercial product which has no development history in common with Johnson's original Unix Lint, AFAIK. A non-commercial alternative is Splint.
what's their max baudrate for communicating with USB converters? I looked on their website, it says 230400 but I may have misread something. (230Kbaud's not enough for my application)
Got some code here that isn't working: Basically I have 3 lists and want to add a class (last) to each item appearing last in each unordered list. Hope that makes sense, Cheers!
Nice work !! Loved it.
This is similar to the accepted answer (because it is using Java to represent the newline rather than EL) but here the <c:set/> element is used to set the attribute: The following snippet also works, but the second line of the <c:set/> element cannot be indented (and may look uglier):
hI, I'm trying to get this code from Larry Nyhoff's book to compile in Bloodshed. It's actually been taken word for word from the author's website, though I declared it on .cpp instead of .h (the .h file ain't working with the tester application). The search(const DataType & item) function is what's giving me grief. The compiler error says: What I'm I missing here?
Excellent answer. This should be the selected answer.
Restoring splitter distances has given me a lot of grief too. I have found that restoring them from my user settings in the form (or user control) Load event gave much better results than using the constructor. Trying to do it in the constructor gave me all sorts of weird behaviour.
Any, but Solaris especially loves threads.
While your basic point is correct, the code you've shown is much slower than the two versions given in the question: Afaik, you get four `int` in one cache line, that means on average you get a latency of less than 30 cycles to load the data (not considering prefetching), you have conditional jumps in your loop (modern architectures hate mispredicting those), so you get much, much more than a cycle for each loop iteration. I'd wager, your swap will take at least 100 to 200 cycles, probably more, but that heavily depends on the numbers you are swapping (how many mispredictions are made).
I guess that works, but I'd never do that. It's screaming bad practice. Think about code readability etc.. Come back to your code in six months and figure out all the function calls inside your HTML markup.
[Building Tcl/Tk with Mingw](http://wiki.tcl.tk/14828)
My form receives asynchronous callbacks from another object on random worker threads. I have been passing the data to the main thread (where it can be used to update onscreen controls) using delegates as shown below. Performance is dreadful -- once I reach 500 updates per second, the program completely locks up. My GUI processing itself is not the problem, as I can simulate this level of updating within the form and have no problems. Is there a more efficient mechanism I should be using to hand off the data from thread to thread?
if the 2 structures variable are initialied with calloc or they are set with 0 by memset so you can compare your 2 structures with memcmp and there is no worry about structure garbage and this will allow you to earn time

I am looking at moving my company's internal business app from VB.NET to PHP. Some of the people were worried about losing GUI features that can be found in .NET. I am under the impression that with the right javascript framework, anything in .NET GUI can be replicated. While I am still researching this point, I would like to ask if form features in .NET GUI can in fact be replicated with javascript and slightly more importantly, will it take much longer to develop to get the same results?

Does anyone know of a link to a reference on the web that contains a sample English dictionary word script, that can be used to populate a dictionary table in SQL Server? I can handle a .txt or .csv file, or something similar. Alternatively, I'm adding custom spellchecking functionality to my web apps...but I don't want to integrate the standard components. If there are good references (with samples) on building a dictionary word checker, I'd love that too!
To further explain: Apple once had a section in their agreement that specifically listed the allowable programming languages C, C++, Objective-C and Javascript. This was cause for a lot of confusion, doubts and fear. Eventually Apple stopped naming the languages. I know for a fact that even while this was in place, a variety of apps were on the store, being published, or in development that used Lua scripting in some way or another.

For C/C++ on Windows you have (at least) two choices: Use the SerialPort class provided by .NET. Use the Win32 API. There is an dating back to 1995, and many free libraries and examples on the web to get you started. The .NET option will be much easier.

At work we use teraterm and realterm for checking serial data is correctly formatted. Also we have a hardware splitter with a switch so we can monitor traffic to our application via a cable back to another port. Windows allows you access to the serial port via CreateFile. That gives you a handle and from there you can configure access.
It will create a new enumerable, which may not be desirable in some scenarios. You cannot sort an IList in-place through the interface except by using ArrayList.Adapter method in my knowledge.
Another thing I hate to see is the : I've seen this in real code.
This is an excellent question. I look forward to hearing an answer.
You can probably instruct your web server to compress the data for you at the HTTP level, and then you won't have to worry about it on either end. For Apache, have a look at .

I'm trying to decode the result of the Python os.wait() function. This returns, according to the Python docs: a tuple containing its pid and exit status indication: a 16-bit number, whose low byte is the signal number that killed the process, and whose high byte is the exit status (if the signal number is zero); the high bit of the low byte is set if a core file was produced. How do I decode the exit status indication (which is an integer) to obtain the high and low byte? To be specific, how do I implement the decode function used in the following code snippet:

As far as I know, and I'm definately not a hacker, you are completely fine. Really, if someone wanted to, they could exploit your code anyway clientside, but i don't see how they could exploit your server side code using javascript (unless you use server side javascript)
My application links against libsamplerate.a. I am doing this to make distributing the final binary easier. I am worried that perhaps the code inside the .a file depends on some other libraries I also will need to distribute. But if it doesn't I am worried I am bloating up my application too much by including multiple copies of eg. libc. What exactly will be inside libsamplerate.a? Just libsamperate's bytecode? Or more?

As a dev I worry about event logs getting full and then hitting an error when logging an error. But I suppose you have to deal with 'logging' failures with whatever you are logging to (file/db).

Great thanks fung! It was especially the "Starting Our Debugging Session" section that helped.
I really liked which C++ however you can easily translate that to C# the author has a web site too.
on the root window is how xbindkey does it. Be careful about having some alternative method of killing the grab though, it's very annoying to have to go somewhere to into your own box just to kill that process... And that's why, if it was me, +"echo 'moo' > /tmp/moo-fifo" would be the way to do it. That way, you could also control it in any number of other ways you haven't thought of yet.
Excellent. Thanks.

When you say it didn't detect it do you really mean you were collecting everything and the packet you wanted wasn't there? I find that hard to believe. It doesn't need any configuration, it just works. Getting a sensible filter so it gets what you want and not loads of other crap is harder!

After doing some more digging and hacking it turns out to not be terribly hard to drop the Cakewalk interface into an application. It's not pretty without a lot of work, but it works right away.
This code is 99% correct. However, if we call Peek or Pop without putting anything on the stack, it will crash as the index is -1. This could be easily fixed by adding index bounds checking.
might be an answer, but I'm afraid I can't speak from experience.
If I understand this correctly: Current CPU developing companies like AMD and Intel have their own API codes (the assembly language) as what they see as the 2G language on top of the Machine code (1G language) Would it be possible or desirable (performance or otherwise) to have a CPU that would perform IL handling at it's core instead of the current API calls?
i think by using this code you can have a limited size queue..which is also Circular buffer.

Does string immutability work by statement, or by strings within a statement? For example, I understand that the following code will allocate two strings on the heap. "hello" will remain on the heap until garbage collected; and s now references "hello world!" on the heap. However, how many strings does the following line allocate on the heap...1 or 2? Also, is there a tool/way to verify the results?
My work just gave me a quad core computer, and WOW build times are fast! (What used to take 20+ minutes now takes 7 minutes). Anyway, Visual Studio builds project in parallel (great for build times), but scrambles the output: Is there a plugin that sorts the output when the build is complete?
I've tried msysGit and Git on Cygwin. Both work just fine in and of themselves and both run gitk and git-gui perfectly. Now how the heck do I configure a mergetool?

Tom - I did the Java thing from 1996 until 2002. My official reason for leaving Actuate? Microsoft understood the need for basic things like enumerated types (since added to Java but it took way too long) and excellent Windows UI support and Actuate had no interest in building .NET products.
Is there a standard way to see how much stack space your app has and what the highest watermark for stack usage is during a run? Also in the dreaded case of actual overflow what happens?

This is great, thanks for the tip!

David Flanagan's excellent book on JavaScript has an example that shows how to perform XPath queries in IE. On page 518 of fifth edition, you can see the following code snippet taken from example 21-10: I found out the hard way that this code is absolutely necessary. It appears (although I cant understand why) that on IE XMLHttpRequest seems to to randomly return a reference to either the document corresponding to the received XML or the documentElement. Whats happening here?
The StackOverflow transcripts are enormous, and sometimes I want to link to a little bit within it. How do I create an HTML anchor in a FogBugz wiki page?
As I'm a former C++ programmer that code makes me cringe. Multiple postincrements in C/C++ have "undefined behaviour" (i.e. it's an error, but the compiler won't tell you so.) It's legal in C# and Java will always output "1,2,3" but your C++ programmer colleagues will hate it.
The (NLTK) is an excellent resource if you're considering Python as a language.

I worked on a desktop app that used EJB and Hibernate. We had to set everywhere, because when the objects get serialized, they lose their ability to be fetched from the backend. That's just how it goes, unfortunately. If you are concerned with performance, you could use caching on the backend so that your non-lazy fetches are not as painful.
Any progress on this one? To embed complex functionality (including history-aware interactivity) on an MVC page without involving the rest of the page is a reasonable and common desire. The only alternative I see, to require the using page to track each components query-string state, is horrible.

I recently imported about 60k records into a table that relates data in one table to data in another table. However, my client has since requested that a sort order be added to all 60k records. My hope is there is a nice clean way to auto generate these sort orders in a SQL Update. The finished data should look something like this: Can this be done? Any suggestions would be hugely appreciated. --Anne
This can probably be done using JavaScript.
This is really great, worked a treat thanks
Not without logging or tracing, I'm afraid
If you can edit the code, you should just re-write it to use a custom API that does what you want. Failing that, use Maximilian's technique, but be warned that it is a maintenance horror. If you cannot edit the code, you can patch the import tables to redirect calls to your own code. A description of this technique can be found in - search for the section titled "Spying by altering of the Import Address Table". This is dangerous, but if you're careful you can make it work. Also check out , which does the same sort of thing but doesn't require you to mess around with the actual patching.
I can't seem to find the answer to this anywhere... I have a function that needs to set the bg color of two tables. Only the first table in the function is being affected. Is only one for loop allowed in a function? ...or is the 1st for loop maybe never exiting? I can pretty much work around this by creating multiple functions but I really want to understand why this behaves the way it does! Thanks! Here is my simplified code:

I'm receiving a recovery feed from an exchange for recovering data missed from their primary feed. The exchange strongly recommends listening to the recovery feed only when data is needed, and leaving the multicast once I have recovered the data I need. My question is, if I am using asio, and not reading from the NIC when I don't need it, what is the harm? The messages have sequence numbers, so I can't accidentally process an old message "left" on the card. Is this really harming my application?
I currently have speakers set up both in my office and in my living room, connected to my PC via two sound cards, and would like to switch the set of speakers I'm outputting to on the fly.

If you are getting thrown off by the fact that the user/group is listed as having "Limited Access" on the ACLs on, say, the parent site/web. That's just a placeholder SharePoint uses to make sure people have access to at least the bare minimum set of objects (e.g. theme and other UI files and the parent web itself) to get to the list or item you actually want them to have access to. As long as the group only has access on a single list, you should have to worry about them having access to anything else.
too bad this behavior isn't a setting. I think it makes sense in theory why they did it this way, but in practice it's just really annoying
If DevStudio is crashing a lot on you, you might try uninstalling any add-ins and extensions as a first step. It might save you a lot of pain.
All the places I've worked have given me liberty with regard to development environment, although the production env. has always been some brand of Linux - usually RH or CentOS. I personally use Windows 7 for dev., and I wouldn't use anything else. You spend way less time debugging the OS, and more time coding. This makes management much happier! (PHP developer mostly)
To add something to this (cause I found it while searching on this problem, and my solution involved slightly more)... If you don't have a "Browse with..." option for .aspx files (as I didn't in a MVC application), the easiest solution is to add a dummy HTML file, and right-click it to set the option as described in the answer. You can remove the file afterward. The option is actually set in: C:\Documents and Settings[user]\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\VisualStudio[version]\browser.xml However, if you modify the file directly while VS is running, VS will overwrite it with your previous option on next run. Also, if you edit the default in VS you won't have to worry about getting the schema right, so the work-around dummy file is probably the easiest way.

I'm not sure why this is marked down. AutoHotkey is an excellent solution when you need to do something that you just can't do using an existing API. It has many safeguards that can be used to ensure that the correct program is targeted. There are many possibilities. The answer that is marked as an answer, isn't an answer. It just an obvious statement which is the reason the question was asked in the first place. I would suggest anyone marking down this answer should first look into AutoHotkey and learn what it can do. It should be built into windows.
Part of the reason why this is "Dog Slow" is that you are building the proxy every time you connect to the service. You could avoid this pain by using wsdl2ruby to build the proxy permanently and then call the pre-generated proxy.

Excellent comment, Flea. My head asplode.
May want to replace `"\\"` with `File.separator` to make it work on linux.
I'd like to be able to see what registry keys are used for. A book on the registry would be fine as well. Info on Windows Vista changes would be great!
What is the replacement string for an image url? (edit your question to add this info). For example, what is the desirable result for "http://www.mysite.com/nonono.jpg"?
The ebook summarises Thread.Suspend and Thread.Resume thusly: The deprecated Suspend and Resume methods have two modes â dangerous and useless! The book recommends using a synchronization construct such as an or to perform thread suspending and resuming.
I tested this code out with an Access 2007 database with no exceptions (I went as high as 13000 inserts). However, what I noticed is that it is terribly slow as you are creating a connection every time. If you put the "using(connection)" outside the loop, it goes much faster.
log4php has great functionality but for me it worked very slow!
Programming Student here...trying to work on a project but I'm stuck. The project is trying to find the miles per gallon per trip then at the end outputting total miles and total gallons used and averaging miles per gallon How do I loop back up to the first question after the first set of questions has been asked. Also how will I average the trips...will I have to have a variable for each of the trips? I'm stuck, any help would be great!
totally awesome
If I can avoid it, no. And, to my knowledge, there is always a way to avoid it. But I'm not stating that it's totally useless either
Strange - No one mentioned GEdit (Gnome) or OpenKomodo (Windows, Mac, GNU/Linux...). Both of them are great! OpenKomodo especially deals with tabs and spaces very well. And - it's free. Whee! When I need a lighter weight thingy, I just use GEdit. Download OpenKomodo here -
I am suffering from the problem in the first example - my enums don't show up at all. This answer doesn't even attempt to address that issue.
I just came across this idiom in some open-source Python, and I choked on my drink. Rather than: or even: the code read: I can see this is the same result, but is this a typical idiom in Python? If so, is it some performance hack that runs fast? Or is it just a once-off that needs a code review?
Craig Shoemaker has made an excellent show on asp.net caching:

Both of these answers were really helpful - thanks!
Great question!

Google led me to solution (base64_encode). Hope this helps!
Actually it doesn't even have to be malicious code. It could just be a accidental name collision.
Ew, that sounds a bit ugly! Is it possible for an instance of a class to be created before its unit's initialization section has run? In other words could an instance of TMyObject try to use FLogger before it's been set in the initialization section?
I'm new to developing web applications using the .NET framework. I'm just wondering if .NET has any support for saving a custom int value for each (logged in) user? Could I perhaps use the HttpContext.User property or something? I'd be really grateful for some help on this! /Ylva
RegEx is a horrible option for performing replaces on a large amount of text. As powerful as it is, many RegEx proponents see all the world as a nail and RegEx as their hammer. For use cases involving large amounts of text, look at FastReplacer http://stackoverflow.com/a/11442008/141172

I'm building a marketplace application that uses PayPal Express. I've got a form for sellers to input their PayPal API credentials, but I need a way to validate them by making some sort of call to PayPal. I'm using the PaypalExpressGateway in ActiveMerchant, and I don't see anything other than the standard purchase controls. Is there any sort of null-operation that can be used? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Very well put, I really like this !!!
In that case I'm afraid you're not going to get this to do what you want. You could do it with javascript if you have control over that & you want to go down that road, but it's a dark, scary road with dragons ;)
If you are not forced to use a particular compiler I suggest to use Qt and in the new 5.3 version you will find a class dedicated to serial ports: The code you will write will run on all supprited Qt platforms, at least those that have serial ports.
I have a .net assembly that has a COM+ ServicedCopmonent in it and at the moment I install it into the GAC to get everything working. This means that I need to have every assembly that it references in the GAC as well. During development it is quite painful to make changes to thes assemblies, re-install them to the GAC and then test. Is it possible to maintain the COM+ component but not have everything in the GAC?

I have found Html Helpers extremely useful to simplify view pages code. Apart from the ones included in the latest release of Asp.Net Mvc which one do you use? How much you can reuse them in different projects and are they linked only to html generation or did you put some custom logic inside?
awesome - what started off as a gripe turned into a real educational experience - thanks everyone!
I've knocked up a basic version of what I'm looking for, it's not perfect but it'll do the job until something better comes along.
Bookmark the Use your web browser's find-text command. Unexpected as it may seem, I find this is actually quicker than using , which for some reason seems to take ages to start up. It is also much better than because the HTML page lists all the documentation for all the methods on a single page. Often methods are related to others, and switching between 2 's is painful
Too awesome! This actually answered an unasked question of mine, how to stop people from cutting off others in my corporate meeting.
Use case for me: So I can compare objects against a MSSQL Compact Entity without worrying about how they typed the fields. (I am comparing an object against a compact database where some fields are name isSomething and IsSomething.) In other words, for sake of laziness.
Creating custom types can be done in PowerShell. Kirk Munro actually has two great posts that detail the process thoroughly. The book also has a code sample for creating a domain specific language to create custom types. The book is excellent all around, so I really recommend it. If you are just looking for a quick way to do the above, you could create a function to create the custom object like
I think your question would be more appropriately phrased as "What are some recommended ways to handle auditing in a database?"
Well, keep in mind that (in theory) you have the original code to help, as well as the text of the log messages. The only thing that should be obfuscated would be the class and member names. In addition, many tools (Dotfuscator is one) create a map file to tell you what obfuscated construct name maps back to which original name - this can make it a pain to figure out exactly where the log messages come from, but nowhere near impossible.
Great point - will change!

Matt - can you revue the accepted answer. You have to scroll a long way to get to a [pure javascript answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5686237/360211) and I fear some users just take the accepted answer as gospel and use antiquated libraries as a result.
@Cocowalla: the finalizer should dispose the unmanaged mutexes unless it can't know if the mutex was created by the managed app or attached to an existing one.
The class in Java has only two data members, a reference to an array and a sizeâwhich you need anyway if you don't use an . So the only advantage to not using an is saving one object allocation, which is unlikely ever to be a big deal. If you're creating and disposing of many, many instances of your container class (and by extension your instance) every second, you might have a slight problem with garbage collection churnâbut that's something to worry about if it ever occurs. Garbage collection is typically the least of your worries.
lint is constantly updated... so why would you want a more recent one. BTW flexelint is lint
List comprehension performance link is dead :(
Thanks djuth, this works great and is very simple! I have to admit it is pretty limiting though, for example, I would love to have it autocomplete a staff name and then return a staffID but I can probably play around with what's added and parsed.
There are major oversights in the CSS spec related to basic page layout. Sad. It is about as well thought out as HTML.
This is a problem with Windows Firewall that is very annoying from its introduction. And persist trough several versions of windows. I have two questions: Is it possible to be disabled or at least require confirmation in XP/2003 Server ? Does UAC handles this in Vista/2008 server? If it does not - is there any way to disable it?
Thank you Gumbo, I suppose this'll have to do. I would've liked a more concise solution but thank you anyway, I never knew this js-uri class existed!
I need to pass a regex substitution as a variable: This, of course, doesn't work. I tried eval'ing the substitution: but that didn't work either. What horribly obvious thing am I missing here?
This was annoyingly annoying... If you have a the need to export your RegexBuddy history you can take a look at , which prints to the console your history, also as Json.
Great question!
if/when you figure this out - you definitely need to share it back to the world.. I'd love something like this!
I'm working on a webservice + AJAX interface, and I'm worried about authentication. This moment I'm passing username and password to the webservice as arguments, but I fear that this approach is highly insecure. I was told that ssl could solve my problem, but I want more alternatives. My webservice is written in php and my interface is in php + AJAX. The webservice receives arguments from POST or GET and retreives xml (in a future maybe I'll use JSON)
How come this doesn't work (operating on an empty select list But this does: Replace: var dropdownList = $("#requestTypes"); With plain old javascript: var dropdownList = document.getElementById("requestTypes"); Any insights greatly appreciated!!

is a really great option for git. Most of the free, public hosting sights will insist that you license your code with an OSS license (and, possibly, your documentation). That's potentially a different thing that you're talking about (backups). For just backups, you may want to try a for-pay service or even something like .
Why would you want to do that?? No offense, but that is the most annoying and useless 'feature' ever!
I really love anonymous inner classes...
This doesn't appear to be an answer to the question, and only tangentially related to the topic (this questions is about dealing with `Date` objects in JavaScript, not with parsing text to create `Date` objects). If this is an actual answer that you're posting with a differing method from the other answers, it isn't clear what that difference is. This may best be represented by a comment instead of an answer, or by another question altogether. If you have questions about what content belongs where, http://stackoverflow.com/faq might be helpful to you. Hope you enjoy the site!

recently I've been reading through Scott Meyers's excellent book. In one of the last tips he covered some of the features from TR1 - I knew many of them via Boost. However, there was one that I definitely did NOT recognize: tr1::reference_wrapper. How and when would I use tr1::reference_wrapper?

(Python Remote Objects) is fairly clever if all your server/clients are going to be in Python. I use alot though since I'm communicating with hosts that are not always Python. XMPP lends itself to being extended fairly easily too. There is an excellent XMPP library for python called which is reasonably up to date and has no dependancy on Twisted.
Excellent method for minor changes. Just what I was looking for. Thank you.
I have been given a .Hive file from a registry which i have to parse and use the contents as part of a html report(from this i assume i have to convert to text somehow). The whole thing must be done within the program so i cant just convert the hive file and then run it through my program. I currently have no idea how to even start this so any help on this would be great. Any ideas would be fantastic!

I've tried with Postsharp, but their current implementation targets 2.0, and it's getting painful to make it work. Should I roll out my own AoP implementation (I'm thinking of a very VERY basic and utilitarian implementation here) Or there is an alternative I'm not aware of?

In our eternal quest to integrate Javascript into our RSpec and Cucumber workflow we're evaluating and are provisionally very excited about it. Any advice on Culerity in general or specifically as compared to Selenium?
I would say yes, it was Anders Heljsberg's intent to make the observer pattern a first-class language feature with events in C#, based on his experience with Delphi. Anders makes this and other design intentions clear in an excellent interview on .

Background: I'm currently debugging an application written over a custom-built GUI framework in C++. I've managed to pin down most bugs, but the bugs I'm having the most trouble with tend to have a common theme. All of them seem to be to do with the screen refreshing, redrawing or updating to match provided data. This is a pain to debug, because I can't break on every refresh, and most of this stuff is time-sensitive, so breakpoints occasionally "fix" the bug. Q: Does anyone have any tips for debugging Windows-based GUIs, especially regarding the refreshing of individual components?
I always seem to use Get when working with data (strongly typed or otherwise) from the database and I have never really needed to use Fill although I just as easily could use Fill instead of get when pulling out and updating data. Can anyone provide guidance as to the implications and gotchas of each method? In what situations is it preferable to use one or the other? Any performance implications? Thanks in advance for the answers! I love this community!
Designing with Web Standards is a great first read!
Something that has always bugged me is how unpredictable the method in Javascript is. In my experience, the timer is horribly inaccurate in a lot of situations. By inaccurate, I mean the actual delay time seems to vary by 250-500ms more or less. Although this isn't a huge amount of time, when using it to hide/show UI elements the time can be visibly noticeable. Are there any tricks that can be done to ensure that performs accurately (without resorting to an external API) or is this a lost cause?

Is there a way to reuse a 3rd party control reference? For example, I have this referenced in my App.xaml I don't want to repeat this 3rd party control xml namespace on each page/control that needs a control from the library. Is there anyway to centralize these references and use the prefix defined here? The possibility of each control having a different prefix is also worrisome. In asp.net you would put a reference in the web.config and it was available globally, I'm just looking to see if there is a similar method in WPF.
Congratulations on the new job! Relax and keep your cool. Read something on . I guess, the process itself will make sure you are productive as long as you apply common sense :)
A quick remark to the excellent answer by Troy, if the version you downloaded is the newer one, 3.2, the Quick Nav has been remapped to Ctrl + Shift + Q.
A colleague recently asked me how to deep-clone a Map and I realized that I probably have never used the clone() method- which worries me. What are the most common scenarios you have found where you need to clone an object?
The solution is crying out for the MSMQ solution but unfortunately the posting service is not on the domain. Is there anyway to post to the public queue that is on the domain from the machine in the DMZ? I could use a webservice to post but this is a extra component to maintain. The database table is the alternative solution but again it is not the ideal.
Sorting the hashes is also a possibility that I have considered. I'm a bit concerned about memory usage, but I'll worry about that later.
I've been trimming the UI of our website by doing the following in the onload event of that control: This has become very tedious because there are so many controls to check again and again. As soon as I get it all working, designers request to change the UI and then it starts all over. Any suggestions?

We ended up using a Java applet. It was a nightmare. Normally it would have been awful, but as this was for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the added distance & language differences made it a nightmare. In the end, it worked "enough." But again, nightmare. I would not recommend it.
Dude I feel your pain. I used my blogger address but since moved my blog. I don't want to continue using my blogger address as my id now there is a google option.
Don't forget about ! JSON seems to have better support though. For example, the library has excellent built-in JSON functions.
Furthermore if you need to look at the .NET/unmanaged stack just donwload and look at your w3wp.exe processes to examine memory and other stats without having to do a remote/local debugging (just look at the .NET Tab on the properties of the process). It will show all the .NET performance counters for that particular process. Awesome tool!
I know I can configure command line arguments in the Run configuration but I want to run a java file multiple times with different command line arguments. It's a pain to change the Run Configuration every time. Is there a way I can make Eclipse prompt me for command line arguments every time I run the program?
Pretty new to this scene and trying to find some documentation to adopt best practices. We're building a fairly large content site which will consist of various media catalogs and I'm trying to find some comparable data / architectural models so that we can get a better idea of the approach we should use using a framework we've never made use of before. Any insight / help would be greatly appreciated!
