I am working on a test application based on ASP.NET MVC. I am new to CSS stuff so I am learning that as well. I have created a master page called "new.master" and created a new css "new.css". I am calling the view from controller as: What I am doing is that I am frequently updating the css and master page. So I run the application in debug mode frequently. After sometime I stop seeing the effect of changes in css. When I "view source" in chrome and check the css, it shows an old version. When I change the name of both master page and css, I start to receive updated views but that works for sometime and then again I stop getting the CSS updates. Have you faced this problem?

I am new to Delphi (been programming in it for about 6 months now). So far, it's been an extremely frustrating experience, most of it coming from how bad Delphi is at handling dates and times.

FlexMonkey may be more of a pain than it is worth. Gorrilla Logic claims it works with custom components but I have found this is not the case. Anything with a renderer seems to have serious problems. It is a lot harder to set up tests than they claim and the tests aren't stable.

Not for me, but I can suggest some possibilities :It may cause problem while editing--  This can be solved by using some comments--  And then this will cause the code messier Some code may crash and your code success will go away from you  . --  No solution - unless you know more about the code!

Everytime I execute my app in debug mode, the execution breaks inside some class file of an external library that I'm using. Even though it's a NullPointerException, for some reason I can hit resume and continue the execution. In case you're curious, I've put the stacktrace below.

You are processing the newline character as if it is legitimate input. You should either read the entire line (including the newline, perhaps using a ) and then process the first character of the line or simply add a test to skip newlines in your loop logic.P.S.

You have two divs, one over the other, and the one on top is transparent. However, when you scroll you want the div on the bottom to hide as it goes under the first transparent div.

I have a custom UITableViewController class that is shared among a few ViewControllers of my app. I would like to do pre-emptive fetching before the user has hit the bottom of the page. However, I noticed that if the user scrolls up and then down again, my VC will trigger another fetching. So I came up with a flag isFetching which checks to prevent double fetching. Unfortunately I am running asynchronous code and I need a way to reset this flag after my fetching operation has completed.

I have an application where I need to adjust view position according to current focused subview (it's a list with focusable items, current focused item must be in the center of the screen - used for a tv application controlled from tv remote). Position must be adjusted with animation. I got it working with just one problem: if the user changes focus before the animation is complete (quickly taps "up" button twice) next animation starts with "jump" - it starts from the same position as did the first one. So what I try to do is I cancel previous animation and start another, but then new animation starts from the point where first animation was started, so user can see a very obvious jumps in the animation, which look really awful.

I am trying to build an application that can request files from a service running on another machine in the network. These files can be fairly large (500mb   at times). I was looking into sending it via TCP but I'm worried that it may require that the entire file be stored in memory. There will probably only be one client.

So, the following hack seems to work, but it's really incredibly ugly IMO, as it relies on you controlling the line-height and using absolute positioning.

One justified, one centered. Then clip the justified one.HTML CSS Fiddle.Of course, the above code is hard-coded for the specific width.

I have a Django application built in our shop and currently we are moving to production that will run a apache web server. The application will run on multiple webservers Due to load issues.

Now, if a user goes to webservers-a and creates A unique id and then in the next request goes to webservers-b he will be invalidated because the unique id created for him will be local to webservers-a.

The objective of my endeavour is to have a linux computer execute a command (or maybe a local script - on the target) over a local network. Ideally, I would use SSH to do this but unfortunately my embedded target is running WinCE which is absolutely horrible. To do this, I would require an SSH server running on WinCE. I looked into the OpenSSH port but it doesn't work and development for that stalled six years ago. To wrap up, I am looking for an alternative solution to using SSH on WinCE. So, any ideas?

I have an Android app that looks absolutely horrible if the user sets their font size to large or extra large (via Settings -  Display -  Font size in Ice Cream Sandwich). It just plain wasn't designed for variable font sizes, and it makes a lot of the text unreadable. I've seen applications that preserve the font size for most views, so I know that there has to be a way to do this.

I can't help think that making XML ad XMLList both unrelated, as in both extend Object directly, is a design flaw in the AS3 core library.

I am sorry to say this but most Silverlight grids do not support cell merging. At least not out of the box. I have resorted to using Component One studio for Silverlight in order to achieve this, and even then it hasn't been exactly a walk in the park. Consider C1 Data Grid control. Here is a sample on with sample code and a small write up. The down side of such solutions is that C1's controls are extremely expensive :( I wish Micro oft came up with some enhancements in SL5 that would accommodate for such issues.

I have run into this too. It is very annoying! Here's why it might be happening. The width of your li items, plus any margins is more than the width of #maincontainer. That means the last li item spills over #maincontainer and the script will want to move that last bit in, leaving an extra click. One way to check this: assign an id to the last li, and make the width less, and see if that doesn't fix it. If so you need to make the #maincontainer wider.

Why use a  Mutex  here? The  Acquire  method just returns a reference to an instance (this is a reference type). Whether the object referenced is mutable or immutable is irrelevant. The reference is to the same object no matter if the object mutates. Why do locking?

I have a method that does a bunch of things; amongst them doing a number of inserts and updates. It's declared thusly... It works exactly as it is supposed to and I have no problems with it.

I'm pretty familiar with PGP, and the way it works. I'd like to include some functionality in a project, but so far my research has left my head spinning. What I'd like to do is create a public key with a defined private pass phrase. From there, I'd share the public key with someone where they can then encrypt a message using the key and return it to me where I can decrypt. I envision the code looking something like this.

In ASP.NET MVC, I have a form. In this form the user selects a country, and then the ID is posted back to the server, using a normal . However, for some UX reasons, I use Knockout.

I'm starting my first Drupal project, pretty excited :) I have a question the project is a hotel directory site. at sidebar I have locations list (London, Manchester, Liverpool, etc..) and filter the hotels related on location click. So, how should I create these cities? Should I put them manually and give links manually depending on location id? or is there any better way to create this location list and linking filtering dynamically (via cms, or custom module, etc...)

I'm working with a console application (C#) at the moment. What it does is pulls files from a database and stores them in their relevant folders on the C drive on a local machine. At the moment, every time I run the console app, it pulls ALL the files from the database. What I would like to be able to do, is each time I run it, It only pulls the files that were submitted since I last ran the console application. Currently, this is the linq statement that pulls the files from the database. Ideally I'd like something like the following where the date and time of the last run of the application is stored somewhere: I'm unsure on how to go about achieving this.

It would be a good practice to have a separate button that will disable method since it is very easy to get confused when using your program if the code for disabling and enabling this method is all written in one method named so I suggest you separate them to make the program's design more precise.Next thing you can do is to execute a , whic you are going to mark as .

I know if an ( bracket is entered i should push that into the stack and when a ( is entered i should pop one of the stack but I just cant work out the bits in the middle any help would be loved :) //ADT code	hi guys I am trying to create a program to allow a user to input a sequence of brackets (one at a time) and check to see whether there is a corresponding ending bracket.<br> The brackets are entered on a new line every time to aid in the reading.<br> I've set up an ADT for it but just cant think of how to get the while loop going and the checking.<br> I know if an ( bracket is entered i should push that into the stack and when a ( is entered i should pop one of the stack but I just cant work out the bits in the middle any help would be loved loved //ADT code	5	-1	 hi[0] guys[0] I[0] am[0] trying[0] to[0] create[0] a[0] program[0] to[0] allow[0] a[0] user[0] to[0] input[0] a[0] sequence[0] of[0] brackets[0] one[0] at[0] a[0] time[0] and[0] check[0] to[0] see[0] whether[0] there[0] is[0] a[0] corresponding[0] ending[0] bracket[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] The[0] brackets[0] are[0] entered[0] on[0] a[0] new[0] line[0] every[0] time[0] to[0] aid[0] in[0] the[0] reading[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] I've[0] set[0] up[0] an[0] ADT[0] for[0] it[0] but[0] just[0] cant[0] think[0] of[0] how[0] to[0] get[0] the[0] while[0] loop[0] going[0] and[0] the[0] checking[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] I[0] know[0] if[0] an[0] bracket[0] is[0] entered[0] i[0] should[0] push[0] that[0] into[0] the[0] stack[0] and[0] when[0] a[0] is[0] entered[0] i[0] should[0] pop[0] one[0] of[0] the[0] stack[0] but[0] I[0] just[0] cant[0] work[0] out[0] the[0] bits[0] in[0] the[0] middle[0] any[0] help[0] would[0] be[0] loved[3][+1 Emoticon] //ADT[0] code[0] [[Sentence=-1,5=word max, 1-5]][[[5,-1 max of sentences]]]

I second trying to put the whole path instead.

My client sells jewellery in different materials such as gold, silver, oxidised, etc. When using the Layered Nav widget I would like to display the thumbnails corresponding to the selected filter. So if the users selects the 'gold' attribute in the widget, the gold thumbnails should display in the archive. Using ACF I added image fields to the main product for thumbnails and modified the action in my functions.php. I am trying to write a function that will retrieve the right thumbnail for the currently viewed filter but I cant find a way to check the active attribute for the page. I think it may be possible to use a query_var variable, but my knowledge is too limited. Any help will be hugely appreciated!

I have a table with a field that needs to store 512 characters. My question is this: can you limit the length of a TEXT field (VARCHAR stops at 255 - I can't use it) to 512 characters?

I'm pretty new to Angular but loving it! I am trying to create a modal dialog to display a partial view. ui.bootstap.modal has an option which takes the URL to the partial view to be displayed. I have a route configured on my application module that looks like this: I would like to show the partial template defined as from the above routes. So in my controller I'm attempting to open the modal dialog like so: The modal dialog opens but the contents are just . Do I need to define the route on the server side or can I use Angular routing to return the partial? Thanks!

I have been trying to create a slider based on Nivo Slider that looks and functions similar to the Carousel found at I have viewed questions by and by , however I have been going round in circles for most of the weekend. Now back at square one and starting from the basics. Thus far I have managed to get the navigation working such that mouseenter on a particular nav item triggers nivo-controlNav to display the correct slide and pauses the slider: I also created a subsequent mouseleave function for the nav items (1,2,3 etc.) I'm now stuck at the part where non-mouse events come in. When the slider loads it should update the nav css to highlight the current nav item selected. Here is what I've got (not a lot I know, but I'm trying).

is there anyway to have two TextView in one AutoCompleteTextView result? e.g. And so on... The ArrayAdapter only allows one binding for a view so how could I bind more views in the adapter?

I have two files. File 1: a FASTA file with gene sequences, formated like this example: File 2: A simple text file with JUST the accession identification of the gene. Like so. Every entry in File 2 is somewhere in File 1, but not every entry in File 1 is in File 2. I need to remove all the entries from File 1 that are not in File 2. I feel like there must be something in the biopython module that could help me, I just don't know what. For instance, I originally thought that I could extract just the accessions from my FASTA file using the function, but this really just lands me with two files of accession numbers.

Ex: 06/08/2012 23:55 is "1 day and 13 minutes from now" I really hope you guys can help! :)	I want to find out how long time there is till a specific from .<br> I have searched everywhere, but can't really find anything.<br> I THINK I have to use the -function together with the -function somehow.<br> The scenario is: I have variable with the day of the week, ex: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 And another variable with a time of the day: h:m And the last variable also with a time of the day: h:m "How long time" could be like: "2 days, 3 hours and 27 minutes from now" The same output should be generated from a specific datetime.<br> Ex: 06/08/2012 23:55 is "1 day and 13 minutes from now" I really hope you guys can help!<br> !	4	-1	 I[0] want[0] to[0] find[0] out[0] how[0] long[0] time[0] there[0] is[0] till[0] a[0] specific[0] from[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] I[0] have[0] searched[0] everywhere[0] but[0] can't[0] really[0] find[0] anything[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] I[0] THINK[0] I[0] have[0] to[0] use[0] the[0] function[0] together[0] with[0] the[0] function[0] somehow[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] The[0] scenario[0] is[0] I[0] have[0] variable[0] with[0] the[0] day[0] of[0] the[0] week[0] ex[0] 1[0] /[0] 2[0] /[0] 3[0] /[0] 4[0] /[0] 5[0] /[0] 6[0] /[0] 7[0] And[0] another[0] variable[0] with[0] a[0] time[0] of[0] the[0] day[0] hh/h[0] mm/m[0] And[0] the[0] last[0] variable[0] also[0] with[0] a[0] time[0] of[0] the[0] day[0] hh/h[0] mm/m[0] How[0] long[0] time[0] could[0] be[0] like[1] "2[0] days[0] 3[0] hours[0] and[0] 27[0] minutes[0] from[0] now[0] The[0] same[0] output[0] should[0] be[0] generated[0] from[0] a[0] specific[0] datetime[0] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]] Ex[0] 06/08/2012[0] 23[0] :55[0] is[0] "1[0] day[0] and[0] 13[0] minutes[0] from[0] now[0] I[0] really[0] hope[2][1 LastWordBoosterStrength] you[0] guys[0] can[0] help[0] [[Sentence=-1,4=word max, 1-5]][+1 Emoticon] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]][[[4,-1 max of sentences]]]

This is simple I hope :) When I create a new web application in WSS does it need to be on port 80 if I want to point an external domain name at it?

I can't comment (yet) so I have to add my comment this way. I thing Mr. David Murdoch's advice is the best for Opera ( ). OMG, what a lovely girl he's got btw.

Although I didn't technically end up escaping the dot, your suggestion actually did make me realize another alternative.

First: I like your approach of being concentrated on a clean and proper state handling of your application.Excellent! But, as you said: Android can kill activities and manage their lifecycle for itself. The OS may release memory allocated for your activity as soon as possible requiring you to allocate it again. This means your fragment may or may not get destroyed. As you can see in your stack trace, FragmentActivity.onCreate is called.This obviously inddicates your existing resources created within the context of the old activity are not access - able anymore. The only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context. For all other resources you should be aware and handle properly that created resources may be invalid at the time you are trying to access them.

I just use following code right now. The table is MyISAM 90MB. terms has FULLTEXT INDEX and it is varchar(255). There are 1,000,000 rows on the table. I wonder if there is any solution which is more resource usage friendly than fulltext search on MySQL? Especially in terms of memory.

I have no clue if this approach would be feasible or not, but then there are two things you could try:1.Create a singleton class where you and the arraylist.

Else you might get .Also a receiver might start before the list is filled.

Does anyone know of a written or video tutorial that will explain how to create a list and list instance in MOSS 2007.

I use Grunt to run my unit tests without assert modules, i just log what i need with grunt and use my "custom" coditions to check the variables's states and values.

So I have a facebook page and a username /llamafont so I obviously want to keep that url. I have had the like button on sub pages (you save phrases and can like/share them on FB) since before I made the page on FB. When I have added the like button to my homepage for my base url, it shows 62k likes - GREAT! However on my facebook page i only have 107 - I guess these are the people who liked the page directly on FB? How can I make the 62K likes show up on my page in facebook? Do I need to add in all the meta og: stuff? Right now I only have og:image in there. Have I screwed it up for good? Or can I make FB recognize the likes somehow? Thanks in advance!

I want to update two channels on Xively and I can not get my datastream to update both. I am seeing one channel being updated ("Temperature"), but the other "sensor1" is not being updated. This is my first crack at a datastream, so any advice/pointers/tutorials to look at would be much appreciated. I have looked all over and can not get this to work. I intially used the Feed API to set up one feed for one sensor, but now i want to add more sensors. Again, any help would be extremely appreciated!

Since it would be quite important to know last reset when looking at the statistics, I want to make absolutely sure the date/time is accurate and shown. Question: How can you get the most accurate date/time of when a/all DMV statistic was reset?

Ryan Oberoi makes an excellent suggestion, but it's a bit overkill for my small ASP.NET MVC web application. I like Lobstrosity's idea since it could apply to any class tag and its short and simple... just what I need. Both are good answers yet one solves the general question (involving a css framework) and the other one solves my specific need...

I agree with PW. OPAL is an excellent choice.

Everytime I create a new IK handle in Maya via MEL, it creates an end effector named "effector1", or "effector2", depending on what is in my scene.

  I think it's cleaner. We do not have to re-implement and maintain different versions start-needed-srv in each script. Just one "vdsm_init_common.sh --start-needed-srv" to rule them all. Here we disagree. But we repeat our-selves... and not progressing, so we can stop doing that... and progress... as whatever we have now is much better than whatever existed before. When a user/downstream maintainer opens the service/unit/script whatever he expects to actually understand what happens there and why, and not start to dig within application to find issues and modify downstream specific logic. At upstart of have the start/stop convention (yeah... you need something for legacy sysv, but simple if is doing the work), for systemd you need nothing as it handles the dependencies, for openrc you need nothing as it handles the dependencies.

Actually, I realized late last night that it probably didn't make sense to specify the damage using frects, since the damage is defined on pixel boundaries (I was originally thinking frect because sourceCrop is a frect, but that's not exactly analagous).

That probably implies that we should use hwc_region_t, except that size_t is way overkill and will eat another 8 bytes in 64-bit relative to this (since we're currently getting the uint32_t for free because of padding).

Ah, ok. Let me explain a bit: The USBIP server/client is split into two parts. On the server side, there's an userspace daemon (usbipd) and a kernel module usbip-host.ko.

Request/Response stuff (which has a protocl version 0x111) is the user space portion. The usbip-host.ko and vhci-hcd.ko part (aka URBs handling, version   0x0000) is part of the kernel.

Here, we are making a bunch of datastore calls in a loop, which could fail (or time out) and drop half of the updates. Since this is derived data and an async update is probably okay, a more robust approach would be to put tasks on the App Engine task queue to refresh each graph. Failed tasks automatically get retried. The most robust way to do the update: given a graph id, regenerate the graph from a query of all its dependencies, sort of like a makefile. Then, since it's idempotent, it doesn't matter if it fails sometimes, and we can ignore concurrency as well since multiple writes don't matter. (Incremental updates would be more efficient but trickier to get right, so I typically put that off until it seems necessary.)

I don't like that I have still exposed policy-specific's in line 528 :/ newest_file   durable_file or data_file or ts_file I nearly changed this to pass the ondisk file set to is_obsolete() and let that method take care of (a) determining the policy-specific newest file and then (b) determining if the file under test is obsolete. But backed off because there would be a slight loss of optimisation because as it stands, the loop is never executed if there is *no* newest file. I guess a call to a policy.get_newest(file_set) would do it.

I remember seeing error like "Lproc: Attempting to register osc more than once" when trying to mount lustre file system on server node.

I still think you also need to check that the  bi- get('blocktype') is allowed for  artefacttype- name.

I swear I read somewhere on Smashing magazine along time ago that all pseudo selectors are less performant but I can't find such an article.

I think that this class makes more sense than the Branch class because there are several places in Gerrit where refs strings are manipulated without using Branch objects. Jgit does define some of those constants, but we cannot use jgit everywhere, particularly in GWT, which I suspect is why this class is here in the first place. We need a good place in Gerrit for these constants, and the Branch object itself is a much higher level object than this simple class (it isn't only about refs, but rather refs and projects).

I thought a little about this. Basically it should work like this: ImageName is null: there's no friendly name for the image, use the ImageId to list/display the image. ImageName is not null: there's a friendly name specified for the image but since it can be duplicated (it's not guaranteed to be unique), then we should also give an hint about which image it is (at the moment that's done reporting the initial part of ImageId, just as git does with short hashes). Now considering this last case if we set ImageName   ImageId, then the displayed name would be something like "myisoimagename.iso (myisoim)". Please let me know if you have a better idea on how to handle this all. Anyway (beside the image name displaying) I think that the safest way to address this now is not to set an ImageName since in fact there's not an additional friendly name to set.	I thought a little about this.<br> Basically it should work like this: ImageName is null: there's no friendly name for the image, use the ImageId to list/display the image.<br> ImageName is not null: there's a friendly name specified for the image but since it can be duplicated (it's not guaranteed to be unique) then we should also give an hint about which image it is (at the moment that's done reporting the initial part of ImageId, just as git does with short hashes)<br> Now considering this last case if we set ImageName   ImageId, then the displayed name would be something like "myisoimagename.<br>iso (myisoim)<br> Please let me know if you have a better idea on how to handle this all.<br> Anyway (beside the image name displaying) I think that the safest way to address this now is not to set an ImageName since in fact there's not an additional friendly name to set.	2	-1	 I[0] thought[0] a[0] little[0] about[0] this[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] Basically[0] it[0] should[0] work[0] like[1] this[0] ImageName[0] is[0] null[0] there's[0] no[0] friendly[1] name[0] for[0] the[0] image[0] use[0] the[0] ImageId[0] to[0] list/display[0] the[0] image[0] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]] ImageName[0] is[0] not[0] null[0] there's[0] a[0] friendly[1] name[0] specified[0] for[0] the[0] image[0] but[0] since[0] it[0] can[0] be[0] duplicated[0] it's[0] not[0] guaranteed[0] to[0] be[0] unique[0] then[0] we[0] should[0] also[0] give[0] an[0] hint[0] about[0] which[0] image[0] it[0] is[0] at[0] the[0] moment[0] that's[0] done[0] reporting[0] the[0] initial[0] part[0] of[0] ImageId[0] just[0] as[0] git[0] does[0] with[0] short[0] hashes[0] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]] Now[0] considering[0] this[0] last[0] case[0] if[0] we[0] set[0] ImageName[0] ImageId[0] then[0] the[0] displayed[0] name[0] would[0] be[0] something[0] like[1] myisoimagename[0] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]] iso[0] myisoim[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] Please[1] let[0] me[0] know[0] if[0] you[0] have[0] a[0] better[0] idea[0] on[0] how[0] to[0] handle[0] this[0] all[0] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]] Anyway[0] beside[0] the[0] image[0] name[0] displaying[0] I[0] think[0] that[0] the[0] safest[1] way[0] to[0] address[0] this[0] now[0] is[0] not[0] to[0] set[0] an[0] ImageName[0] since[0] in[0] fact[0] there's[0] not[0] an[0] additional[0] friendly[1] name[0] to[0] set[0] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]][[[2,-1 max of sentences]]]

I thought the point of the platform file is to make it easier by requiring only one option. Of course the user can also simply use "CC icc CXX icpc CFLAGS -mmic CXXFLAGS -mmic".

I would love to do this. The problem is that all SSH information is only available inside of the SSH project and the server project which implements the REST endpoints doesn't have a dependency on it. Since we don't want this dependency I don't know how to implement it. On the other hand, if you have SSH enabled and you are interested in the SSH summary and connections you can retrieve this information via SSH. The REST endpoints are mainly important for installations where SSH is not available, but in this case there is also no SSH summary and no SSH connections. This is why I'm okay with the current solution of ignoring the SSH stuff in the REST endpoint.

Is this the right API? An alternative is: func If(s RuneSet, tTrue, tFalse Transformer) Transformer type RuneSet interface { Contains(rune) bool } and have unicode.RangeTable implement this interface. If performance is a concern, the If function could do a type assertion to see if s is a *unicode.RangeTable, and switch to an optimized implementation, the same way that the image/draw package does in the stdlib. But I'm not sure if we even want a Ranges or If. The point of the Transformer interface is to transform things in bulk. If you're going to be chopping between two separate transformers depending on the input runes, then it seems like you're not getting the benefit of transforming in bulk. Instead, I'd just loop over the input and append to a []byte. It's not like you have some input that contains both Code Page 437 and Shift-JIS and you want to switch between them. Your phone number Ranges example seems a bit contrived, and again, I'd just for/range over the string for that particular task.

OK, thanks. The approach here and in my patch work fine if the user controls everything they way they want. When auto-detecting everything, this patch is better on non-AVX hardware that happens to have RDTSCP. Otherwise, they effectively work the same. When compiling on a new build host for old compute nodes, this patch will sometimes require the user to make two active settings to make a functional mdrun. That might mean they go hunting for docs twice, unless they find the new install guide section. At least we don't fail mysteriously any more! When compiling on an old build host for new compute nodes, both patches will sometimes make an mdrun that could be better in up to two ways. We could add a nag message for the double negation of the new code in gmx_detect_hardware.c "You, too, could be using RDTSCP!". AFAIK the proposition that using RDTSCP is good in user space is just educated guesswork, though. I was slightly concerned about one of the latter cases (build host is old, user knows they have AVX on the compute nodes, so they know to set SIMD and don't know RDTSCP exists / is relevant), but if we add the new nag then this case is solved well enough. So I'm happy to adopt this solution. Thanks! Shall I abandon my patch, send reviewers here, and one of us work on Erik's feedback and/or the new nag? If we add the nag, commit message needs updating.

On HTTP /abandon and /restore accept no body. This results in null being passed to the apply() method, which handles it gracefully by creating an empty input. I think its common to call /abandon and /restore with no input. Your tests are certainly showing that. Perhaps we should overload abandon() and restore() methods to also have a no-arg form that passes null to apply the same way the HTTP interface does when the client doesn't supply a body.

On second sought: actually you don't need this file (endpoint) at all. We have already POST /changes that creates a change and what are you doing here is to delegate to its apply() method, after translating your own Input to ChangeInfo. The only reason to have this class is to get the UiAction for granted (Guice DynamicItem binding and discovery). But you could solve this in different way: just construct UiAction on you own in ProjectJson and add it to actions map manually. See an example how it's done in InlineEdit series: [1]. Now, on the client side, from your custom UiAction you can invoke the original REST endpoint: POST /changes. The only difference to current solution: you would need to pass project name too, obviously. This also raises the question do we want to have this button on project info screen at all?

Patch Set 1: Thanks for your reviews. To be honest, it would be nice, if you could be a bit more friendly to - not first time in case of Thomas, but occasional - contributors. IMHO one or two -1 are enough for the beginning. Bjrn and Philipp, you're really helpful contributors, thanks for that. We were discussing the "patch for a patch rule" over the last days, which we enjoined on ourselves as core team members some time ago (and it works in at least most of the cases I think). Please don't treat this as harsh words, I just want to make you aware of the fact that motivating every new contributor is very important for us, and hopefully also for you as an essential part of the TYPO3 community. Thanks for your support! Steffen P.S: The reason, why Jenkins fails is probably, because of the parent commit is very old and the patch has to be rebased. Will try to get this done now (if network connection allows)	Patch Set 1: Thanks for your reviews.<br> To be honest, it would be nice, if you could be a bit more friendly to - not first time in case of Thomas, but occasional - contributors.<br> IMHO one or two -1 are enough for the beginning.<br> Bjrn and Philip, you're really helpful contributors, thanks for that.<br> We were discussing the "patch for a patch rule" over the last days, which we enjoined on ourselves as core team members some time ago (and it works in at least most of the cases I think)<br> Please don't treat this as harsh words, I just want to make you aware of the fact that motivating every new contributor is very important for us, and hopefully also for you as an essential part of the TYPO3 community.<br> Thanks for your support!<br> Steffen P.<br>S: The reason, why Jenkins fails is probably, because of the parent commit is very old and the patch has to be rebased.<br> Will try to get this done now (if network connection allows)	3	-3	 Patch[0] Set[0] 1[0] Thanks[1] for[0] your[0] reviews[0] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]] To[0] be[0] honest[0] it[0] would[0] be[0] nice[1] if[0] you[0] could[0] be[0] a[0] bit[0] more[0] friendly[1] to[0] not[0] first[0] time[0] in[0] case[0] of[0] Thomas[0] but[0] occasional[0] contributors[0] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]] IMHO[0] one[0] or[0] two[0] -1[0] are[0] enough[0] for[0] the[0] beginning[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] Bjrn[0] and[0] Philipp/Philip[0] you're[0] really[0] helpful[1][1 LastWordBoosterStrength] contributors[0] thanks[1] for[0] that[0] [[Sentence=-1,3=word max, 1-5]] We[0] were[0] discussing[0] the[0] patch[0] for[0] a[0] patch[0] rule[0] over[0] the[0] last[0] days[0] which[0] we[0] enjoined[0] on[0] ourselves[0] as[0] core[0] team[0] members[0] some[0] time[0] ago[0] and[0] it[0] works[0] in[0] at[0] least[0] most[0] of[0] the[0] cases[0] I[0] think[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] Please[1] don't[0] treat[1][NegatedDueToPreviousWord] this[0] as[0] harsh[-1] words[0] I[0] just[0] want[0] to[0] make[0] you[0] aware[0] of[0] the[0] fact[0] that[0] motivating[0] every[0] new[0] contributor[0] is[0] very[0] important[0] for[0] us[0] and[0] hopefully[0] also[0] for[0] you[0] as[0] an[0] essential[0] part[0] of[0] the[0] TYPO3[0] community[0] [[Sentence=-2,2=word max, 1-5]] Thanks[1] for[0] your[0] support[1] [[Sentence=-1,2=word max, 1-5]] Steffen[0] P[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]] S[0] The[0] reason[0] why[0] Jenkins[0] fails[-2] is[0] probably[0] because[0] of[0] the[0] parent[0] commit[0] is[0] very[0] old[0] and[0] the[0] patch[0] has[0] to[0] be[0] rebased[0] [[Sentence=-3,1=word max, 1-5]] Will[0] try[0] to[0] get[0] this[0] done[0] now[0] if[0] network[0] connection[0] allows[0] [[Sentence=-1,1=word max, 1-5]][[[3,-3 max of sentences]]]

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this (2 inline comments) I don't see the need for this change. If you built with the ebuild unmodified, you'd get an image.bin which would be what you want. As far as I could tell looking at the new function, it's identical to the old one except that you're leaving out the original image.bin. The difference between image.bin and image.rw.bin is that cros_bundle_firmware is being passed the --force-rw option in one case and not in the other. What that does is it changes the way parts of the image are put together so that vboot doesn't allow the RO only optimization even if the RO firmware claims it supports it. The RO only optimization is where you run the whole firmware out of RO instead of jumping into an RW copy partway through. If you really don't want to enable that optimization, you can not pass that flag to vboot when running VbInit.

Patch Set 4: Although already merged, I don't think this is the right solution. Currently the behavior of the permissions system (TCEmain and thus also all other components) is to use "checkLanguageAccess" only if the TCA for the table has a "languageField". "pages" is not such a table, because there is "pages_language_overlay". So the current integrators solution to restrict a user not to be able to edit the "Original Language" is to remove the permissions for editing table "pages" and only allow "pages_language_overlay". See also http://forge.typo3.org/issues/27794 This is not what is being done in the patch, but instead you simply check for checkLanguageAccess. Similar problem we have in the "List view", as the context menu provides more options (i.e. for content elements) than really permitted. Permission check in TCEmain is more "aggressive" than in the GUI. Correct solution for this particular fix would be to check if user has "edit permissions" on the "pages" table - just like TCEmain also does. As this is confusing for integrators in general, I would rather propose that someone thinks about a better approach on "language restriction permissions on pages" in the first place before fixing the GUI. I am undecided still if we should revert this merge, but I am currently pretty sure we should not backport that to 4.5. Maybe in your research you find out different aspects than I did or you can prove me wrong as I have only touched the "surface" of the whole complex. Please let me know!

That was actually the original code. If dest    src and you're only copying one byte at a time, if you start from the top you'll never overwrite the data you haven't copied yet. Otherwise, you have to start from the other end. *dest     *src memcpy;, but memcpy is not *dest     *src;. To quote from the pretty short man page: The memory areas must not overlap. That's the difference between memcpy and memmove. If there was no overlap at all (which we could check for) then you could use memcpy, and that would make the normal case work like it always has. But I'm working on a change to add optimized versions of memmove for x86 and ARM.

That's a bit of a philosophical discussion. I thought about it earlier, but the reason for limiting the range is that we only use the single precision range in the SIMD parts of Gromacs - since all algorithms in particular need to work if the user has set the precision to single - we only use double to improve precision, not range. One _could_ of course add double precision range tests, but then the next obvious question is why we allow routines to provide incorrect results for NaN,  -infinity, negative zero, etc? And, of course, not to mention - why we allow more than 1 ulp error :-) For the error functions I actually experimented a bit with only providing accurate results in a smaller-than-double-precision-range, and this might still be a useful optimization strategy in the future. Thus, I like the idea of merely testing what we actually need, and if somebody comes up with a neat idea to improve that while only altering things we don't need, that should fundamentally be a good thing(TM)!

When you move a host to maintenance then that calls disconnectStorageServer which should remove this definition so in general this shouldn't affect anything negatively. The case where this would remain is in case of an error flow where for some reason it wasn't disconnected properly or something. Even if that happens, it's not that interesting as a few leftover connections shouldn't affect the host negatively (think about FC where the host is always connected). The advantage is that most of the time (since hosts don't move between DCs very often) the host would automatically reconnect whenever it reboots (e.g. due to sanlock fencing) and it would be available to engine almost immediately reducing recovery time. Imo that is more important.

Yes, it is a bug in adb, no ambiguity here, but it's really subtle, so it'd be nice to have a better description of the problem, it's not really Python specific as you mention, i.e. something like: """ Some programs want to launch an adb command and collect its output by calling CreateProcess with inheritable stdout/stderr handles, then using read() to get its output. When this happens, the stdout/stderr handles passed to the adb client process will also be inheritable. When starting the adb server here, care must be taken to reset them to non-inheritable.

Yes. Actually, look at what I just merged to master with the query operators, in particular you might want to read the documentation in user-search.txt. You can write a query to identify changes that can be submitted: is:open CodeReview 2 Verified 1 -Verified-1 -CodeReview-2 If we put that string (minus the is:open part that would be implied) into your field, it means what you want it to mean... you can submit this only if the above expression is true. By making it a single string, all you need to do is feed the string from the table through the ChangeQueryBuilder to get a Predicate ChangeData , and then run match() on that to see if the submit is possible. That completely removes the FunctionState mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time. So the existence of that ChangeQueryBuilder and its Predicate support classes is why I was trying to steer you into a simple string here. We have the code already done to handle that as a string, and users can use the same syntax to search for changes as they can for controlling how we manage them.
