process of researching a possible fix for https://github.com/symfony/flex/issues/285.\r\n\r\nThe desired behaviour is for the symfony skeleton installation to just always remove the VCS directory and don't ask in the CLI for it.\r\n\r\nCurrently this is implemented that Symfony Flex just completely disables interactivity in IO, so that the call to `->askConfirmation()` [here](https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/994bac0c153348c09d42cd77225c465c1b81e8e9/src/Composer/Command/CreateProjectCommand.php#L201) just [returns the default value](https://github.com/symfony/console/blob/bf56f79b8604e4dd32c236048606c507e9dbbcd3/Helper/QuestionHelper.php#L55) (`true`).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately that also kills all subsequent interactive calls.\r\n\r\nAs I read the code:\r\nhttps://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/src/Composer/Command/CreateProjectCommand.php#L176-L202\r\n\r\nthere currently is no way to just disable interactivity for the one call to `askConfirmation()`.\r\nIt's always either all scripts + the \"delete VCS dir\" one, or nothing.\r\n\r\nSo I would like to ask whether it would be possible to:\r\n\r\n* dispatch another event between `Installer` and `->askConfirmation()` so that Flex can hook specifically in to disable interactivity in this event and re-enable again in the event `POST_CREATE_PROJECT_CMD ` (something like `POST_ROOT_PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES_INSTALL`).\r\n* provide a way to just always remove the VCS directory in a plugin (env var, some global setting or a callback somewhere).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7002/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,

Symfony installer has specified a php 5 version and I've changed my require to php 7 without realizing the config.platform issue. That leaves me hunting for a version of php that isn't installed anywhere on my system. Using verbose or even very very verbose doesn't seem to help. \r\n\r\nI used xdebug to track it down and saw that the package knew what the problem really was in its description but it wasn't revealing this to the user. This patch exposes that information. The nested parens aren't pretty, but I think developers will be able to parse it.\r\n\r\nThe patch starts by determining the version in the same way it used to. Then it double checks that we have a package, and that it is a CompletePackage so that it has a description. If so it appends the description to the version information.\r\n\r\nI double checked it with phpcs and it complained about line lengths, but it also did this for much of the rest of the file.\r\n\r\nThe output looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLoading composer repositories with package information\r\nUpdating dependencies (including require-dev)\r\nYour requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.\r\n\r\n  Problem 1\r\n    - This package requires php >=7.0.0 but your PHP version (5.6.0; Package overridden via config.platform (actual: 7.0.22)) does not satisfy that requirement.\r\n```", "created_at": "2018-01-15T15:00:04Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-15T15:32:37Z", "closed_at": null, "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha":

definitely not ready to actually merge yet, but @naderman suggested discussing PRs early, so here goes. Oh, in case there would otherwise be confusion, this is unrelated to my work on `replace`.\r\n\r\nThe problem this helps solve is enabling Drupal installations/updates for nontechie users without exceeding the resource limitations of a webserver environment; it's a huge pain point for Drupal right now that it isn't possible to do Composer-enabled installs/updates in a browser. The way it helps solve it is by allowing a plugin to initially restrict the `Pool` to a repository containing only one version of each required package, all of which are pre-selected to be compatible with each other; this should make the sat problem and number of modeled packages/decisions trivial/very fast in execution time/low in memory. For sites that only need things available from this special repository, a complete Composer run ought to work fine within the confines of a webserver environment. When the site does also have requirements from the wider world, the first solver run will fail, but it will fail fast. This PR would allow a plugin to then introduce packagist etc to the Pool and rerun the Solver. (I believe @thom8 has talked with some Composer maintainers about the possibility of running the solver on a remote \"solver as a service\" host; I've got a vague idea of also swapping out the standard solver for the remote one long-term when a full-scale dependency resolution is required.)\r\n\r\nSomething like this have a chance of going in?", "created_at": "2017-12-03T02:35:30Z",

first I did not consider it to be worth discussing about because the improvements are not significant enough (well, a penny saved is a penny earned but still). However, I still decided to make the changes public because at the end of the day this is what open source is all about. Maybe someone can improve the impact even more based on my idea \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nSo the idea behind it is that most `Rule` instances get a `$reasonData` assigned which mostly is an instance of `Link` or `CompletePackage`. While debugging a little, I noticed that even though a big amount of `Link` instances are actually of equal content, they are not the same (they do not share the same object hash). They are different objects because every `Package` creates its `Link` objects (`requires`,  `conflicts` etc.) when it is created. So the `Link` objects are not shared across memory.\r\nHence, I thought by making sure to not create them but instead reference to an already created one if it is the same should decrease memory usage. This seems to be true but I was expecting an even bigger impact. Now somebody can tell me maybe why the impact is not bigger or make it bigger based on my idea \ud83d\ude0b ", "created_at": "2017-03-21T20:44:17Z", "updated_at": "2017-04-18T21:35:03Z", "closed_at":

myext\npickle convert\n\nAdd the dep to your project. If you do not want to fork an ext, you can create a dep vs a zip file and use the artifact repository, it should work.\n\nStill many things to solve but at least there is something to play with now\n\nUpdate:\n\nAccording to our discussions, it is now a two steps process to install extensions, to make sure users understand that installing extensions may affect many projects:\n\nFirst, the usual command:\ncomposer install\n\ncomposer will tell you to run\ncomposer install --install-extensions\n\nif the project has extensions dependencies\n", "created_at": "2015-04-01T09:11:30Z",

Expect changes and check the TODO list. Review/testing is welcome.\n\nThis pull request is intended to add support for developer-level package signing to Composer using openssl. It includes a \"create-keys\" command to generate an RSA private and public keys (the private key should be encrypted using a passphrase), an \"add-dev-key\" command which imports a private key and extracts the public key for distribution in a package within keys.json, and a \"sign\" command which assembles a manifest of files, their checksums, and lengths, and signs the manifest using a private key within manifest.json. This PR does not address any form of package or metadata signing by Packagist which is also required for repository-level security. This PR does not depend on SSL/TLS support.\n\nTODO:\n1. ADD support for Composer to cache keys.json data since it should only be populated on first encounter so that attacks to alter keys.json have a chance to be detected.\n2. ADD support for Composer to verify package signatures as part of its install/update routines.\n3. ADD verification status to install/update output.\n4. ADD composer command options to reject unverified packages (I'll make it optional but it's strongly suggested that this become enabled by default in time).\n\nYou can currently test sign packages using the following commands (the first three are only required to setup keys):\n\n```\nphp composer.phar create-keys --prefix=myUniquePrefix\n\nphp composer.phar add-dev-key ./path/to/myUniquePrefix-private.pem\n\nphp composer.phar sign-dev-keys ./path/to/myUniquePrefix-private.pem\n```\n\n```\nphp composer.phar sign ./path/to/myUniquePrefix-private.pem\n```\n\nThis should result in two new files: keys.json (used to distribute authorised public keys) and manifest.json (a signed listing of all package files, their SHA256 checksums and lengths).\n\nThe theory is to sign packages and commit keys/manifest changes as the FINAL step before tagging a release. If you make any other changes, or altered the tag after signing, then the signatures could never be verified by users.\n", "created_at": "2014-03-16T11:01:20Z", "updated_at": "2017-04-18T19:12:12Z",

If so it appends the description to the version information.\r\n\r\nI double checked it with phpcs and it complained about line lengths, but it also did this for much of the rest of the file.\r\n\r\nThe output looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLoading composer repositories with package information\r\nUpdating dependencies (including require-dev)\r\nYour requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.\r\n\r\n  Problem 1\r\n    - This package requires php >=7.0.0 but your PHP version (5.6.0; Package overridden via config.platform (actual: 7.0.22)) does not satisfy that requirement.\r\n```", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7011/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7010", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7010/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7010/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7010/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/7010", "id": 288357014, "number": 7010, "title": "composer validate show report scripts-descriptions for non-existent scripts", "user": {"login": "mhujer", "id": 353372, "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/353372?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer", "html_url": "https://github.com/mhujer", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 4929226, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/labels/Easy%20Pick", "name": "Easy Pick", "color": "c2e0c6", "default": false}, {"id": 237341, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/labels/Feature", "name": "Feature", "color": "0e8a16", "default": false}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2018-01-13T20:22:11Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-16T07:24:48Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "My `composer.json` (note the _typo_ in the first item in `scripts-descriptions`):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"test\": \"phpunit\",\r\n    \"phpcs\": \"phpcs --standard=PSR2 src\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"scripts-descriptions\": {\r\n    \"phpcsxxx\": \"Checks that the application code conforms to coding standard\",\r\n    \"test\": \"Launches the preconfigured PHPUnit\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput of `composer diagnose`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nComposer version: 1.6.2\r\nPHP version: 7.1.12\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run this command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncomposer validate --strict\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./composer.json is valid\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I expected this to happen:\r\n```\r\nWarning: Description for non-existent script \"phpcsxxx\" found in \"scripts-descriptions\"\r\n```\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7010/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7007", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7007/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7007/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7007/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/7007", "id": 288310935, "number": 7007, "title": "`composer update` not work at local repo.

process of researching a possible fix for https://github.com/symfony/flex/issues/285.\r\n\r\nThe desired behaviour is for the symfony skeleton installation to just always remove the VCS directory and don't ask in the CLI for it.\r\n\r\nCurrently this is implemented that Symfony Flex just completely disables interactivity in IO, so that the call to `->askConfirmation()` [here](https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/994bac0c153348c09d42cd77225c465c1b81e8e9/src/Composer/Command/CreateProjectCommand.php#L201) just [returns the default value](https://github.com/symfony/console/blob/bf56f79b8604e4dd32c236048606c507e9dbbcd3/Helper/QuestionHelper.php#L55) (`true`).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately that also kills all subsequent interactive calls.\r\n\r\nAs I read the code:\r\nhttps://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/src/Composer/Command/CreateProjectCommand.php#L176-L202\r\n\r\nthere currently is no way to just disable interactivity for the one call to `askConfirmation()`.\r\nIt's always either all scripts + the \"delete VCS dir\" one, or nothing.\r\n\r\nSo I would like to ask whether it would be possible to:\r\n\r\n* dispatch another event between `Installer` and `->askConfirmation()` so that Flex can hook specifically in to disable interactivity in this event and re-enable again in the event `POST_CREATE_PROJECT_CMD ` (something like `POST_ROOT_PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES_INSTALL`).\r\n* provide a way to just always remove the VCS directory in a plugin (env var, some global setting or a callback somewhere).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7002/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,

Symfony installer has specified a php 5 version and I've changed my require to php 7 without realizing the config.platform issue. That leaves me hunting for a version of php that isn't installed anywhere on my system. Using verbose or even very very verbose doesn't seem to help. \r\n\r\nI used xdebug to track it down and saw that the package knew what the problem really was in its description but it wasn't revealing this to the user. This patch exposes that information. The nested parens aren't pretty, but I think developers will be able to parse it.\r\n\r\nThe patch starts by determining the version in the same way it used to. Then it double checks that we have a package, and that it is a CompletePackage so that it has a description. If so it appends the description to the version information.\r\n\r\nI double checked it with phpcs and it complained about line lengths, but it also did this for much of the rest of the file.\r\n\r\nThe output looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLoading composer repositories with package information\r\nUpdating dependencies (including require-dev)\r\nYour requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.\r\n\r\n  Problem 1\r\n    - This package requires php >=7.0.0 but your PHP version (5.6.0; Package overridden via config.platform (actual: 7.0.22)) does not satisfy that requirement.\r\n```", "created_at": "2018-01-15T15:00:04Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-15T15:32:37Z", "closed_at": null, "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha":

definitely not ready to actually merge yet, but @naderman suggested discussing PRs early, so here goes. Oh, in case there would otherwise be confusion, this is unrelated to my work on `replace`.\r\n\r\nThe problem this helps solve is enabling Drupal installations/updates for nontechie users without exceeding the resource limitations of a webserver environment; it's a huge pain point for Drupal right now that it isn't possible to do Composer-enabled installs/updates in a browser. The way it helps solve it is by allowing a plugin to initially restrict the `Pool` to a repository containing only one version of each required package, all of which are pre-selected to be compatible with each other; this should make the sat problem and number of modeled packages/decisions trivial/very fast in execution time/low in memory. For sites that only need things available from this special repository, a complete Composer run ought to work fine within the confines of a webserver environment. When the site does also have requirements from the wider world, the first solver run will fail, but it will fail fast. This PR would allow a plugin to then introduce packagist etc to the Pool and rerun the Solver. (I believe @thom8 has talked with some Composer maintainers about the possibility of running the solver on a remote \"solver as a service\" host; I've got a vague idea of also swapping out the standard solver for the remote one long-term when a full-scale dependency resolution is required.)\r\n\r\nSomething like this have a chance of going in?", "created_at": "2017-12-03T02:35:30Z",

first I did not consider it to be worth discussing about because the improvements are not significant enough (well, a penny saved is a penny earned but still). However, I still decided to make the changes public because at the end of the day this is what open source is all about. Maybe someone can improve the impact even more based on my idea \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nSo the idea behind it is that most `Rule` instances get a `$reasonData` assigned which mostly is an instance of `Link` or `CompletePackage`. While debugging a little, I noticed that even though a big amount of `Link` instances are actually of equal content, they are not the same (they do not share the same object hash). They are different objects because every `Package` creates its `Link` objects (`requires`,  `conflicts` etc.) when it is created. So the `Link` objects are not shared across memory.\r\nHence, I thought by making sure to not create them but instead reference to an already created one if it is the same should decrease memory usage. This seems to be true but I was expecting an even bigger impact. Now somebody can tell me maybe why the impact is not bigger or make it bigger based on my idea \ud83d\ude0b ", "created_at": "2017-03-21T20:44:17Z", "updated_at": "2017-04-18T21:35:03Z", "closed_at":

downloaders would need to be updated following the same principle, the GitDownloader also needs to be finished (only public repos can be managed by the loop for now).\nThe console output also would need to be handled differently.\nIf someone else likes the approach, help is welcomed for porting the other downloaders to use and return promises!

within a project.\n\nExample project and extension composer.json:\nhttps://gist.github.com/pierrejoye/1bbc2bdcec5887e60490\n\nIf you like to test with more extensions:\ngit  clone myext\ncd myext\npickle convert\n\nAdd the dep to your project. If you do not want to fork an ext, you can create a dep vs a zip file and use the artifact repository, it should work.\n\nStill many things to solve but at least there is something to play with now\n\nUpdate:\n\nAccording to our discussions, it is now a two steps process to install extensions, to make sure users understand that installing extensions may affect many projects:\n\nFirst, the usual command:\ncomposer install\n\ncomposer will tell you to run\ncomposer install --install-extensions\n\nif the project has extensions dependencies\n", "created_at": "2015-04-01T09:11:30Z",

Expect changes and check the TODO list. Review/testing is welcome.\n\nThis pull request is intended to add support for developer-level package signing to Composer using openssl. It includes a \"create-keys\" command to generate an RSA private and public keys (the private key should be encrypted using a passphrase), an \"add-dev-key\" command which imports a private key and extracts the public key for distribution in a package within keys.json, and a \"sign\" command which assembles a manifest of files, their checksums, and lengths, and signs the manifest using a private key within manifest.json. This PR does not address any form of package or metadata signing by Packagist which is also required for repository-level security. This PR does not depend on SSL/TLS support.\n\nTODO:\n1. ADD support for Composer to cache keys.json data since it should only be populated on first encounter so that attacks to alter keys.json have a chance to be detected.\n2. ADD support for Composer to verify package signatures as part of its install/update routines.\n3. ADD verification status to install/update output.\n4. ADD composer command options to reject unverified packages (I'll make it optional but it's strongly suggested that this become enabled by default in time).\n\nYou can currently test sign packages using the following commands (the first three are only required to setup keys):\n\n```\nphp composer.phar create-keys --prefix=myUniquePrefix\n\nphp composer.phar add-dev-key ./path/to/myUniquePrefix-private.pem\n\nphp composer.phar sign-dev-keys ./path/to/myUniquePrefix-private.pem\n```\n\n```\nphp composer.phar sign ./path/to/myUniquePrefix-private.pem\n```\n\nThis should result in two new files: keys.json (used to distribute authorised public keys) and manifest.json (a signed listing of all package files, their SHA256 checksums and lengths).\n\nThe theory is to sign packages and commit keys/manifest changes as the FINAL step before tagging a release. If you make any other changes, or altered the tag after signing, then the signatures could never be verified by users.\n", "created_at": "2014-03-16T11:01:20Z", "updated_at": "2017-04-18T19:12:12Z",

If so it appends the description to the version information.\r\n\r\nI double checked it with phpcs and it complained about line lengths, but it also did this for much of the rest of the file.\r\n\r\nThe output looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLoading composer repositories with package information\r\nUpdating dependencies (including require-dev)\r\nYour requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.\r\n\r\n  Problem 1\r\n    - This package requires php >=7.0.0 but your PHP version (5.6.0; Package overridden via config.platform (actual: 7.0.22)) does not satisfy that requirement.\r\n```", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7011/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7010", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7010/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7010/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7010/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/7010", "id": 288357014, "number": 7010, "title": "composer validate show report scripts-descriptions for non-existent scripts", "user": {"login": "mhujer", "id": 353372, "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/353372?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer", "html_url": "https://github.com/mhujer", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 4929226, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/labels/Easy%20Pick", "name": "Easy Pick", "color": "c2e0c6", "default": false}, {"id": 237341, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/labels/Feature", "name": "Feature", "color": "0e8a16", "default": false}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2018-01-13T20:22:11Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-16T07:24:48Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "My `composer.json` (note the _typo_ in the first item in `scripts-descriptions`):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"test\": \"phpunit\",\r\n    \"phpcs\": \"phpcs --standard=PSR2 src\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"scripts-descriptions\": {\r\n    \"phpcsxxx\": \"Checks that the application code conforms to coding standard\",\r\n    \"test\": \"Launches the preconfigured PHPUnit\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput of `composer diagnose`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nComposer version: 1.6.2\r\nPHP version: 7.1.12\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run this command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncomposer validate --strict\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./composer.json is valid\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I expected this to happen:\r\n```\r\nWarning: Description for non-existent script \"phpcsxxx\" found in \"scripts-descriptions\"\r\n```\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7010/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7007", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7007/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7007/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7007/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/7007", "id": 288310935, "number": 7007, "title": "`composer update` not work at local repo.

process of researching a possible fix for https://github.com/symfony/flex/issues/285.\r\n\r\nThe desired behaviour is for the symfony skeleton installation to just always remove the VCS directory and don't ask in the CLI for it.\r\n\r\nCurrently this is implemented that Symfony Flex just completely disables interactivity in IO, so that the call to `->askConfirmation()` [here](https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/994bac0c153348c09d42cd77225c465c1b81e8e9/src/Composer/Command/CreateProjectCommand.php#L201) just [returns the default value](https://github.com/symfony/console/blob/bf56f79b8604e4dd32c236048606c507e9dbbcd3/Helper/QuestionHelper.php#L55) (`true`).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately that also kills all subsequent interactive calls.\r\n\r\nAs I read the code:\r\nhttps://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/src/Composer/Command/CreateProjectCommand.php#L176-L202\r\n\r\nthere currently is no way to just disable interactivity for the one call to `askConfirmation()`.\r\nIt's always either all scripts + the \"delete VCS dir\" one, or nothing.\r\n\r\nSo I would like to ask whether it would be possible to:\r\n\r\n* dispatch another event between `Installer` and `->askConfirmation()` so that Flex can hook specifically in to disable interactivity in this event and re-enable again in the event `POST_CREATE_PROJECT_CMD ` (something like `POST_ROOT_PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES_INSTALL`).\r\n* provide a way to just always remove the VCS directory in a plugin (env var, some global setting or a callback somewhere).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7002/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,

Symfony installer has specified a php 5 version and I've changed my require to php 7 without realizing the config.platform issue. That leaves me hunting for a version of php that isn't installed anywhere on my system. Using verbose or even very very verbose doesn't seem to help. \r\n\r\nI used xdebug to track it down and saw that the package knew what the problem really was in its description but it wasn't revealing this to the user. This patch exposes that information. The nested parens aren't pretty, but I think developers will be able to parse it.\r\n\r\nThe patch starts by determining the version in the same way it used to. Then it double checks that we have a package, and that it is a CompletePackage so that it has a description. If so it appends the description to the version information.\r\n\r\nI double checked it with phpcs and it complained about line lengths, but it also did this for much of the rest of the file.\r\n\r\nThe output looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLoading composer repositories with package information\r\nUpdating dependencies (including require-dev)\r\nYour requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.\r\n\r\n  Problem 1\r\n    - This package requires php >=7.0.0 but your PHP version (5.6.0; Package overridden via config.platform (actual: 7.0.22)) does not satisfy that requirement.\r\n```", "created_at": "2018-01-15T15:00:04Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-15T15:32:37Z", "closed_at": null, "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha":

definitely not ready to actually merge yet, but @naderman suggested discussing PRs early, so here goes. Oh, in case there would otherwise be confusion, this is unrelated to my work on `replace`.\r\n\r\nThe problem this helps solve is enabling Drupal installations/updates for nontechie users without exceeding the resource limitations of a webserver environment; it's a huge pain point for Drupal right now that it isn't possible to do Composer-enabled installs/updates in a browser. The way it helps solve it is by allowing a plugin to initially restrict the `Pool` to a repository containing only one version of each required package, all of which are pre-selected to be compatible with each other; this should make the sat problem and number of modeled packages/decisions trivial/very fast in execution time/low in memory. For sites that only need things available from this special repository, a complete Composer run ought to work fine within the confines of a webserver environment. When the site does also have requirements from the wider world, the first solver run will fail, but it will fail fast. This PR would allow a plugin to then introduce packagist etc to the Pool and rerun the Solver. (I believe @thom8 has talked with some Composer maintainers about the possibility of running the solver on a remote \"solver as a service\" host; I've got a vague idea of also swapping out the standard solver for the remote one long-term when a full-scale dependency resolution is required.)\r\n\r\nSomething like this have a chance of going in?", "created_at": "2017-12-03T02:35:30Z",

first I did not consider it to be worth discussing about because the improvements are not significant enough (well, a penny saved is a penny earned but still). However, I still decided to make the changes public because at the end of the day this is what open source is all about. Maybe someone can improve the impact even more based on my idea \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nSo the idea behind it is that most `Rule` instances get a `$reasonData` assigned which mostly is an instance of `Link` or `CompletePackage`. While debugging a little, I noticed that even though a big amount of `Link` instances are actually of equal content, they are not the same (they do not share the same object hash). They are different objects because every `Package` creates its `Link` objects (`requires`,  `conflicts` etc.) when it is created. So the `Link` objects are not shared across memory.\r\nHence, I thought by making sure to not create them but instead reference to an already created one if it is the same should decrease memory usage. This seems to be true but I was expecting an even bigger impact. Now somebody can tell me maybe why the impact is not bigger or make it bigger based on my idea \ud83d\ude0b ", "created_at": "2017-03-21T20:44:17Z", "updated_at": "2017-04-18T21:35:03Z", "closed_at":

downloaders would need to be updated following the same principle, the GitDownloader also needs to be finished (only public repos can be managed by the loop for now).\nThe console output also would need to be handled differently.\nIf someone else likes the approach, help is welcomed for porting the other downloaders to use and return promises!

within a project.\n\nExample project and extension composer.json:\nhttps://gist.github.com/pierrejoye/1bbc2bdcec5887e60490\n\nIf you like to test with more extensions:\ngit  clone myext\ncd myext\npickle convert\n\nAdd the dep to your project. If you do not want to fork an ext, you can create a dep vs a zip file and use the artifact repository, it should work.\n\nStill many things to solve but at least there is something to play with now\n\nUpdate:\n\nAccording to our discussions, it is now a two steps process to install extensions, to make sure users understand that installing extensions may affect many projects:\n\nFirst, the usual command:\ncomposer install\n\ncomposer will tell you to run\ncomposer install --install-extensions\n\nif the project has extensions dependencies\n", "created_at": "2015-04-01T09:11:30Z",

Expect changes and check the TODO list. Review/testing is welcome.\n\nThis pull request is intended to add support for developer-level package signing to Composer using openssl. It includes a \"create-keys\" command to generate an RSA private and public keys (the private key should be encrypted using a passphrase), an \"add-dev-key\" command which imports a private key and extracts the public key for distribution in a package within keys.json, and a \"sign\" command which assembles a manifest of files, their checksums, and lengths, and signs the manifest using a private key within manifest.json. This PR does not address any form of package or metadata signing by Packagist which is also required for repository-level security. This PR does not depend on SSL/TLS support.\n\nTODO:\n1. ADD support for Composer to cache keys.json data since it should only be populated on first encounter so that attacks to alter keys.json have a chance to be detected.\n2. ADD support for Composer to verify package signatures as part of its install/update routines.\n3. ADD verification status to install/update output.\n4. ADD composer command options to reject unverified packages (I'll make it optional but it's strongly suggested that this become enabled by default in time).\n\nYou can currently test sign packages using the following commands (the first three are only required to setup keys):\n\n```\nphp composer.phar create-keys --prefix=myUniquePrefix\n\nphp composer.phar add-dev-key ./path/to/myUniquePrefix-private.pem\n\nphp composer.phar sign-dev-keys ./path/to/myUniquePrefix-private.pem\n```\n\n```\nphp composer.phar sign ./path/to/myUniquePrefix-private.pem\n```\n\nThis should result in two new files: keys.json (used to distribute authorised public keys) and manifest.json (a signed listing of all package files, their SHA256 checksums and lengths).\n\nThe theory is to sign packages and commit keys/manifest changes as the FINAL step before tagging a release. If you make any other changes, or altered the tag after signing, then the signatures could never be verified by users.\n", "created_at": "2014-03-16T11:01:20Z", "updated_at": "2017-04-18T19:12:12Z",

If so it appends the description to the version information.\r\n\r\nI double checked it with phpcs and it complained about line lengths, but it also did this for much of the rest of the file.\r\n\r\nThe output looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLoading composer repositories with package information\r\nUpdating dependencies (including require-dev)\r\nYour requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.\r\n\r\n  Problem 1\r\n    - This package requires php >=7.0.0 but your PHP version (5.6.0; Package overridden via config.platform (actual: 7.0.22)) does not satisfy that requirement.\r\n```", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7011/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7010", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7010/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7010/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7010/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/7010", "id": 288357014, "number": 7010, "title": "composer validate show report scripts-descriptions for non-existent scripts", "user": {"login": "mhujer", "id": 353372, "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/353372?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer", "html_url": "https://github.com/mhujer", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhujer/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 4929226, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/labels/Easy%20Pick", "name": "Easy Pick", "color": "c2e0c6", "default": false}, {"id": 237341, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/labels/Feature", "name": "Feature", "color": "0e8a16", "default": false}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2018-01-13T20:22:11Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-16T07:24:48Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "My `composer.json` (note the _typo_ in the first item in `scripts-descriptions`):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"test\": \"phpunit\",\r\n    \"phpcs\": \"phpcs --standard=PSR2 src\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"scripts-descriptions\": {\r\n    \"phpcsxxx\": \"Checks that the application code conforms to coding standard\",\r\n    \"test\": \"Launches the preconfigured PHPUnit\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput of `composer diagnose`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nComposer version: 1.6.2\r\nPHP version: 7.1.12\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run this command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncomposer validate --strict\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./composer.json is valid\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I expected this to happen:\r\n```\r\nWarning: Description for non-existent script \"phpcsxxx\" found in \"scripts-descriptions\"\r\n```\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7010/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7007", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7007/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7007/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7007/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/7007", "id": 288310935, "number": 7007, "title": "`composer update` not work at local repo.

process of researching a possible fix for https://github.com/symfony/flex/issues/285.\r\n\r\nThe desired behaviour is for the symfony skeleton installation to just always remove the VCS directory and don't ask in the CLI for it.\r\n\r\nCurrently this is implemented that Symfony Flex just completely disables interactivity in IO, so that the call to `->askConfirmation()` [here](https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/994bac0c153348c09d42cd77225c465c1b81e8e9/src/Composer/Command/CreateProjectCommand.php#L201) just [returns the default value](https://github.com/symfony/console/blob/bf56f79b8604e4dd32c236048606c507e9dbbcd3/Helper/QuestionHelper.php#L55) (`true`).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately that also kills all subsequent interactive calls.\r\n\r\nAs I read the code:\r\nhttps://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/src/Composer/Command/CreateProjectCommand.php#L176-L202\r\n\r\nthere currently is no way to just disable interactivity for the one call to `askConfirmation()`.\r\nIt's always either all scripts + the \"delete VCS dir\" one, or nothing.\r\n\r\nSo I would like to ask whether it would be possible to:\r\n\r\n* dispatch another event between `Installer` and `->askConfirmation()` so that Flex can hook specifically in to disable interactivity in this event and re-enable again in the event `POST_CREATE_PROJECT_CMD ` (something like `POST_ROOT_PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES_INSTALL`).\r\n* provide a way to just always remove the VCS directory in a plugin (env var, some global setting or a callback somewhere).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/issues/7002/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,

Symfony installer has specified a php 5 version and I've changed my require to php 7 without realizing the config.platform issue. That leaves me hunting for a version of php that isn't installed anywhere on my system. Using verbose or even very very verbose doesn't seem to help. \r\n\r\nI used xdebug to track it down and saw that the package knew what the problem really was in its description but it wasn't revealing this to the user. This patch exposes that information. The nested parens aren't pretty, but I think developers will be able to parse it.\r\n\r\nThe patch starts by determining the version in the same way it used to. Then it double checks that we have a package, and that it is a CompletePackage so that it has a description. If so it appends the description to the version information.\r\n\r\nI double checked it with phpcs and it complained about line lengths, but it also did this for much of the rest of the file.\r\n\r\nThe output looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLoading composer repositories with package information\r\nUpdating dependencies (including require-dev)\r\nYour requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.\r\n\r\n  Problem 1\r\n    - This package requires php >=7.0.0 but your PHP version (5.6.0; Package overridden via config.platform (actual: 7.0.22)) does not satisfy that requirement.\r\n```", "created_at": "2018-01-15T15:00:04Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-15T15:32:37Z", "closed_at": null, "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha":

definitely not ready to actually merge yet, but @naderman suggested discussing PRs early, so here goes. Oh, in case there would otherwise be confusion, this is unrelated to my work on `replace`.\r\n\r\nThe problem this helps solve is enabling Drupal installations/updates for nontechie users without exceeding the resource limitations of a webserver environment; it's a huge pain point for Drupal right now that it isn't possible to do Composer-enabled installs/updates in a browser. The way it helps solve it is by allowing a plugin to initially restrict the `Pool` to a repository containing only one version of each required package, all of which are pre-selected to be compatible with each other; this should make the sat problem and number of modeled packages/decisions trivial/very fast in execution time/low in memory. For sites that only need things available from this special repository, a complete Composer run ought to work fine within the confines of a webserver environment. When the site does also have requirements from the wider world, the first solver run will fail, but it will fail fast. This PR would allow a plugin to then introduce packagist etc to the Pool and rerun the Solver. (I believe @thom8 has talked with some Composer maintainers about the possibility of running the solver on a remote \"solver as a service\" host; I've got a vague idea of also swapping out the standard solver for the remote one long-term when a full-scale dependency resolution is required.)\r\n\r\nSomething like this have a chance of going in?", "created_at": "2017-12-03T02:35:30Z",

first I did not consider it to be worth discussing about because the improvements are not significant enough (well, a penny saved is a penny earned but still). However, I still decided to make the changes public because at the end of the day this is what open source is all about. Maybe someone can improve the impact even more based on my idea \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nSo the idea behind it is that most `Rule` instances get a `$reasonData` assigned which mostly is an instance of `Link` or `CompletePackage`. While debugging a little, I noticed that even though a big amount of `Link` instances are actually of equal content, they are not the same (they do not share the same object hash). They are different objects because every `Package` creates its `Link` objects (`requires`,  `conflicts` etc.) when it is created. So the `Link` objects are not shared across memory.\r\nHence, I thought by making sure to not create them but instead reference to an already created one if it is the same should decrease memory usage. This seems to be true but I was expecting an even bigger impact. Now somebody can tell me maybe why the impact is not bigger or make it bigger based on my idea \ud83d\ude0b ", "created_at": "2017-03-21T20:44:17Z", "updated_at": "2017-04-18T21:35:03Z", "closed_at":

downloaders would need to be updated following the same principle, the GitDownloader also needs to be finished (only public repos can be managed by the loop for now).\nThe console output also would need to be handled differently.\nIf someone else likes the approach, help is welcomed for porting the other downloaders to use and return promises!

within a project.\n\nExample project and extension composer.json:\nhttps://gist.github.com/pierrejoye/1bbc2bdcec5887e60490\n\nIf you like to test with more extensions:\ngit  clone myext\ncd myext\npickle convert\n\nAdd the dep to your project. If you do not want to fork an ext, you can create a dep vs a zip file and use the artifact repository, it should work.\n\nStill many things to solve but at least there is something to play with now\n\nUpdate:\n\nAccording to our discussions, it is now a two steps process to install extensions, to make sure users understand that installing extensions may affect many projects:\n\nFirst, the usual command:\ncomposer install\n\ncomposer will tell you to run\ncomposer install --install-extensions\n\nif the project has extensions dependencies\n", "created_at": "2015-04-01T09:11:30Z",

Expect changes and check the TODO list. Review/testing is welcome.\n\nThis pull request is intended to add support for developer-level package signing to Composer using openssl. It includes a \"create-keys\" command to generate an RSA private and public keys (the private key should be encrypted using a passphrase), an \"add-dev-key\" command which imports a private key and extracts the public key for distribution in a package within keys.json, and a \"sign\" command which assembles a manifest of files, their checksums, and lengths, and signs the manifest using a private key within manifest.json. This PR does not address any form of package or metadata signing by Packagist which is also required for repository-level security. This PR does not depend on SSL/TLS support.\n\nTODO:\n1. ADD support for Composer to cache keys.json data since it should only be populated on first encounter so that attacks to alter keys.json have a chance to be detected.\n2. ADD support for Composer to verify package signatures as part of its install/update routines.\n3. ADD verification status to install/update output.\n4. ADD composer command options to reject unverified packages (I'll make it optional but it's strongly suggested that this become enabled by default in time).\n\nYou can currently test sign packages using the following commands (the first three are only required to setup keys):\n\n```\nphp composer.phar create-keys --prefix=myUniquePrefix\n\nphp composer.phar add-dev-key ./path/to/myUniquePrefix-private.pem\n\nphp composer.phar sign-dev-keys ./path/to/myUniquePrefix-private.pem\n```\n\n```\nphp composer.phar sign ./path/to/myUniquePrefix-private.pem\n```\n\nThis should result in two new files: keys.json (used to distribute authorised public keys) and manifest.json (a signed listing of all package files, their SHA256 checksums and lengths).\n\nThe theory is to sign packages and commit keys/manifest changes as the FINAL step before tagging a release. If you make any other changes, or altered the tag after signing, then the signatures could never be verified by users.\n", "created_at": "2014-03-16T11:01:20Z", "updated_at": "2017-04-18T19:12:12Z",
