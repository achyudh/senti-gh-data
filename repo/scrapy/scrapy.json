I have set up the spider with a single start URL, to bring up the list of jobs I am interested in. From there, I launch a separate request for each page of the results. Within each of these requests, I launch a separate request calling back to a different parse method, to handle the individual job URLs.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm finding is that the start URL and all of the results page requests are handled fine - scrapy connects to the site and returns the page content. However, when it attempts to follow the URLs for each individual job page, scrapy isn't able to form a connection. Within my log file, it states:\r\n\r\n`[<twisted.python.failure.Failure twisted.internet.error.ConnectionLost: Connection to the other side was lost in a non-clean fashion: Connection lost.>]`\r\n\r\nI'm afraid that I don't have a huge amount of programming experience or knowledge of internet protocols etc. so please forgive me for not being able to provide more information on what might be going on here. I have tried changing the TLS connection type; updating to the latest version of scrapy, twisted and OpenSSL; rolling back to previous versions of scrapy, twisted and OpenSSL; rolling back the cryptography version, creating a custom Context Factory and trying various browser agents and proxies. I get the same outcome every time: whenever the URL relates to a specific job page, scrapy cannot connect and I get the above log file output.\r\n\r\nIt may be likely that I am overlooking something very obvious to seasoned scrapers, that is preventing me from connecting with scrapy. I have tried following some of the the advice in these threads:\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/1429](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/1429)\r\n[https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/4458](https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/4458)\r\n[https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/2717](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/2717)\r\n\r\nHowever, some of it is a bit over my head e.g. how to update cipher lists etc. I presume that it is some kind of certification issue, but then again scrapy is able to connect to other URLs on that domain, so I don't know.\r\n\r\nThe code that I've been using to test this is very basic, but here it is anyway:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport scrapy\r\n\r\nclass Test(scrapy.Spider):\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tstart_urls = [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t'https://www.totaljobs.com/job/welder/jark-wakefield-job79229824'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/job/welder/elliott-wragg-ltd-job78969310'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/job/welder/exo-technical-job79019672'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/job/welder/exo-technical-job79074694'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t]\r\n\t\r\n\tname = \"test\"\r\n\r\n\tdef parse(self, response):\r\n\t\tprint 'aaaa'\r\n                yield {'a': 1}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe URLs in the above code **are not** being connected to successfully.\r\n\r\nThe URLs in the below code **are** being connected to successfully.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport scrapy\r\n\r\nclass Test(scrapy.Spider):\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tstart_urls = [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t'https://www.totaljobs.com/jobs/permanent/welder/in-uk'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/jobs/permanent/mig-welder/in-uk'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/jobs/permanent/tig-welder/in-uk'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t]\r\n\t\r\n\tname = \"test\"\r\n\r\n\tdef parse(self, response):\r\n\t\tprint 'aaaa'\r\n                yield {'a': 1}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIt'd be great if someone could replicate this behavior (or not as the case may be) and let me know. Please let me know if I should submit additional details. I apologise, if I have overlooked something really obvious.

"https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3062.patch"}, "body": "First, let me say thanks for the extremely useful tool - it really has made a lot of things much simpler than they otherwise would have been. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I'd like to give back what I can if it's useful. The problem I'm having is I don't know exactly where to post this. I'm not familiar enough with scrapy internals to suggest where to put the feature, or if it's even necessary enough to put into the main code base. It also likely needs one more modification before being ready for a main branch contribution. \r\n\r\nThe problem this solves is something at least a few people seem to have run into:\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35289054/scrapy-crawl-multiple-times-in-long-running-process\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22116493/run-a-scrapy-spider-in-a-celery-task/22202877#22202877\r\n\r\nMy use case is a website which requires a virtually endless process able to use various scrapy functionalities at whim. To solve the problem of restarting the twisted reactor, I essentially took the solutions I could find and rolled everything into an extremely simple decorator. Basically all the end-user needs to do is label the function they'd like to run as a scrapy function, and the decorator handles everything necessary in order to use scrapy in a library capacity:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t@reactor_process(timeout=10)\r\n\tdef execute(self, keyword_list):\r\n\t\t''' Crawl the site specifically for certain keywords '''\r\n\t\tfrom crawlers.backend.spider_interface import construct_spider\r\n\t\tfrom scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess\r\n\r\n\t\tspider = construct_spider(self)\r\n\t\tspider.create_start_urls(keyword_list)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tcrawler  = CrawlerProcess(self.settings)\r\n\t\tdeferred = crawler.crawl(spider)\r\n\t\tdeferred.addBoth(lambda _: crawler._stop_reactor())\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the decorator, the function above would only be able to run once - the reactor engine would complain about being restarted. The one problem is that the necessary imports have to be made *within* the function itself - though I think this can be solved with a multiprocessing manager (or worst case, global inspection). \r\n\r\nI also have an interface which allows dynamic creation of contract docstrings / crawlers with different settings inside the same process, which might be useful; but that's something that would probably be better as its own discussion. \r\n  ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3062/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3061", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3061/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3061/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3061/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3061", "id": 285650331, "number": 3061, "title": "Make autothrottle slow down on HTTP 429 response", "user": {"login": "Matthijsy", "id": 5302372, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5302372?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy", "html_url": "https://github.com/Matthijsy", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2018-01-03T10:39:07Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-12T11:03:18Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/pulls/3061", "html_url": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3061", "diff_url": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3061.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3061.patch"}, "body": "When a response has status 429 (Too Many Requests) it is ignored by the AutoThrottle (because the latency is low, so otherwise the spider will speed up).

has made a lot of things much simpler than they otherwise would have been. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I'd like to give back what I can if it's useful. The problem I'm having is I don't know exactly where to post this. I'm not familiar enough with scrapy internals to suggest where to put the feature, or if it's even necessary enough to put into the main code base. It also likely needs one more modification before being ready for a main branch contribution. \r\n\r\nThe problem this solves is something at least a few people seem to have run into:\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35289054/scrapy-crawl-multiple-times-in-long-running-process\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22116493/run-a-scrapy-spider-in-a-celery-task/22202877#22202877\r\n\r\nMy use case is a website which requires a virtually endless process able to use various scrapy functionalities at whim. To solve the problem of restarting the twisted reactor, I essentially took the solutions I could find and rolled everything into an extremely simple decorator. Basically all the end-user needs to do is label the function they'd like to run as a scrapy function, and the decorator handles everything necessary in order to use scrapy in a library capacity:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t@reactor_process(timeout=10)\r\n\tdef execute(self, keyword_list):\r\n\t\t''' Crawl the site specifically for certain keywords '''\r\n\t\tfrom crawlers.backend.spider_interface import construct_spider\r\n\t\tfrom scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess\r\n\r\n\t\tspider = construct_spider(self)\r\n\t\tspider.create_start_urls(keyword_list)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tcrawler  = CrawlerProcess(self.settings)\r\n\t\tdeferred = crawler.crawl(spider)\r\n\t\tdeferred.addBoth(lambda _: crawler._stop_reactor())\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the decorator, the function above would only be able to run once - the reactor engine would complain about being restarted. The one problem is that the necessary imports have to be made *within* the function itself - though I think this can be solved with a multiprocessing manager (or worst case, global inspection). \r\n\r\nI also have an interface which allows dynamic creation of contract docstrings / crawlers with different settings inside the same process, which might be useful; but that's something that would probably be better as its own discussion. \r\n  ", "created_at": "2018-01-03T19:57:42Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-09T19:42:34Z", "closed_at": null, "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha":

`get_output_value()` is not an empty list.\r\n\r\nThat is because `self._local_values` , which stores the new values included via `add_*` or `replace_*` methods, is a[`defaultdict(list)`](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/loader/__init__.py#L37). Then, when we call `get_output_value()` for a field only available in the initial item, an empty list will be set for that field in `self._local_values` (because of [this](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/loader/__init__.py#L125)).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis way, we make sure we don't miss fields from the initial item, in case `get_output_value()` gets

We added test reporting to your repo. We have a blog article on [why we are staging repos](https://blog.testspace.com/testspace-and-open-source).\r\n\r\nNote that we contacted you in the past via an email. We thought it would be easier for you (if interested) by using a Pull Request.   \r\n\r\nFew of the benefits using Testspace:\r\n- view all your test results from a single dashboard\r\n- triage and manage your test failures faster\r\n- add more metrics\r\n- leverage built-in analytics \r\n- get a [test badge](https://help.testspace.com/how-to:get-badge) \r\n[![Space Health](https://open.testspace.com/spaces/74470/badge?token=2f48b759d52023674602ea42e90a5508cad6c953)](https://open.testspace.com/spaces/74470?utm_campaign=badge&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=test \"Test Cases\")\r\n\r\nCheckout **your** test results: https://open.testspace.com/projects/TryTestspace:scrapy from our fork.\r\n\r\n**Why** we are doing this: https://blog.testspace.com/testspace-and-open-source \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Give Testspace a try?**\r\n\r\n1. Create **Open** (free) account: https://testspace.com/pricing\r\n2. Add a **New Project** from the list of Github repo's\r\n3. Add a Travis **Environment Variable**: Name: `TS_ORG`  Value: `organization name` - based on subdomain selected in step 1\r\n4.

nofollow=False)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nPassed the same unit tests as the original code when running tox\r\n```\r\n========================================================= 1679 passed, 6 skipped, 14 xfailed in 458.89 seconds =========================================================\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________ summary ________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n  py27: commands succeeded\r\n  congratulations :)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe that scrapy now handle relative url's

For now I've disabled the call to log.err(). If we want to keep logging the error, we'll need to call flushLoggedErrors() -- see http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/trial.html#auto11 .

One test you can see this with is scrapy.tests.test_engine.EngineTest.test_crawler\n\nFor now I can't promise I'll have time to figure out what's going on with leaving the reactor unclean, but I

spider to scrape a small group of job listings from totaljobs.com. I have set up the spider with a single start URL, to bring up the list of jobs I am interested in. From there, I launch a separate request for each page of the results. Within each of these requests, I launch a separate request calling back to a different parse method, to handle the individual job URLs.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm finding is that the start URL and all of the results page requests are handled fine - scrapy connects to the site and returns the page content. However, when it attempts to follow the URLs for each individual job page, scrapy isn't able to form a connection. Within my log file, it states:\r\n\r\n`[<twisted.python.failure.Failure twisted.internet.error.ConnectionLost: Connection to the other side was lost in a non-clean fashion: Connection lost.>]`\r\n\r\nI'm afraid that I don't have a huge amount of programming experience or knowledge of internet protocols etc. so please forgive me for not being able to provide more information on what might be going on here. I have tried changing the TLS connection type; updating to the latest version of scrapy, twisted and OpenSSL; rolling back to previous versions of scrapy, twisted and OpenSSL; rolling back the cryptography version, creating a custom Context Factory and trying various browser agents and proxies. I get the same outcome every time: whenever the URL relates to a specific job page, scrapy cannot connect and I get the above log file output.\r\n\r\nIt may be likely that I am overlooking something very obvious to seasoned scrapers, that is preventing me from connecting with scrapy. I have tried following some of the the advice in these threads:\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/1429](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/1429)\r\n[https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/4458](https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/4458)\r\n[https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/2717](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/2717)\r\n\r\nHowever, some of it is a bit over my head e.g. how to update cipher lists etc. I presume that it is some kind of certification issue, but then again scrapy is able to connect to other URLs on that domain, so I don't know.\r\n\r\nThe code that I've been using to test this is very basic, but here it is anyway:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport scrapy\r\n\r\nclass Test(scrapy.Spider):\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tstart_urls = [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t'https://www.totaljobs.com/job/welder/jark-wakefield-job79229824'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/job/welder/elliott-wragg-ltd-job78969310'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/job/welder/exo-technical-job79019672'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/job/welder/exo-technical-job79074694'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t]\r\n\t\r\n\tname = \"test\"\r\n\r\n\tdef parse(self, response):\r\n\t\tprint 'aaaa'\r\n                yield {'a': 1}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe URLs in the above code **are not** being connected to successfully.\r\n\r\nThe URLs in the below code **are** being connected to successfully.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport scrapy\r\n\r\nclass Test(scrapy.Spider):\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tstart_urls = [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t'https://www.totaljobs.com/jobs/permanent/welder/in-uk'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/jobs/permanent/mig-welder/in-uk'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/jobs/permanent/tig-welder/in-uk'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t]\r\n\t\r\n\tname = \"test\"\r\n\r\n\tdef parse(self, response):\r\n\t\tprint 'aaaa'\r\n                yield {'a': 1}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIt'd be great if someone could replicate this behavior (or not as the case may be) and let me know. Please let me know if I should submit additional details. I apologise, if I have overlooked something really obvious.

been. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I'd like to give back what I can if it's useful. The problem I'm having is I don't know exactly where to post this. I'm not familiar enough with scrapy internals to suggest where to put the feature, or if it's even necessary enough to put into the main code base. It also likely needs one more modification before being ready for a main branch contribution. \r\n\r\nThe problem this solves is something at least a few people seem to have run into:\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35289054/scrapy-crawl-multiple-times-in-long-running-process\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22116493/run-a-scrapy-spider-in-a-celery-task/22202877#22202877\r\n\r\nMy use case is a website which requires a virtually endless process able to use various scrapy functionalities at whim. To solve the problem of restarting the twisted reactor, I essentially took the solutions I could find and rolled everything into an extremely simple decorator. Basically all the end-user needs to do is label the function they'd like to run as a scrapy function, and the decorator handles everything necessary in order to use scrapy in a library capacity:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t@reactor_process(timeout=10)\r\n\tdef execute(self, keyword_list):\r\n\t\t''' Crawl the site specifically for certain keywords '''\r\n\t\tfrom crawlers.backend.spider_interface import construct_spider\r\n\t\tfrom scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess\r\n\r\n\t\tspider = construct_spider(self)\r\n\t\tspider.create_start_urls(keyword_list)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tcrawler  = CrawlerProcess(self.settings)\r\n\t\tdeferred = crawler.crawl(spider)\r\n\t\tdeferred.addBoth(lambda _: crawler._stop_reactor())\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the decorator, the function above would only be able to run once - the reactor engine would complain about being restarted. The one problem is that the necessary imports have to be made *within* the function itself - though I think this can be solved with a multiprocessing manager (or worst case, global inspection). \r\n\r\nI also have an interface which allows dynamic creation of contract docstrings / crawlers with different settings inside the same process, which might be useful; but that's something that would probably be better as its own discussion. \r\n  ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3062/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3061", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3061/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3061/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3061/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3061", "id": 285650331, "number": 3061, "title": "Make autothrottle slow down on HTTP 429 response", "user": {"login": "Matthijsy", "id": 5302372, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5302372?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy", "html_url": "https://github.com/Matthijsy", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2018-01-03T10:39:07Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-12T11:03:18Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/pulls/3061", "html_url": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3061", "diff_url": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3061.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3061.patch"}, "body": "When a response has status 429 (Too Many Requests) it is ignored by the AutoThrottle (because the latency is low, so otherwise the spider will speed up).

has made a lot of things much simpler than they otherwise would have been. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I'd like to give back what I can if it's useful. The problem I'm having is I don't know exactly where to post this. I'm not familiar enough with scrapy internals to suggest where to put the feature, or if it's even necessary enough to put into the main code base. It also likely needs one more modification before being ready for a main branch contribution. \r\n\r\nThe problem this solves is something at least a few people seem to have run into:\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35289054/scrapy-crawl-multiple-times-in-long-running-process\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22116493/run-a-scrapy-spider-in-a-celery-task/22202877#22202877\r\n\r\nMy use case is a website which requires a virtually endless process able to use various scrapy functionalities at whim. To solve the problem of restarting the twisted reactor, I essentially took the solutions I could find and rolled everything into an extremely simple decorator. Basically all the end-user needs to do is label the function they'd like to run as a scrapy function, and the decorator handles everything necessary in order to use scrapy in a library capacity:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t@reactor_process(timeout=10)\r\n\tdef execute(self, keyword_list):\r\n\t\t''' Crawl the site specifically for certain keywords '''\r\n\t\tfrom crawlers.backend.spider_interface import construct_spider\r\n\t\tfrom scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess\r\n\r\n\t\tspider = construct_spider(self)\r\n\t\tspider.create_start_urls(keyword_list)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tcrawler  = CrawlerProcess(self.settings)\r\n\t\tdeferred = crawler.crawl(spider)\r\n\t\tdeferred.addBoth(lambda _: crawler._stop_reactor())\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the decorator, the function above would only be able to run once - the reactor engine would complain about being restarted. The one problem is that the necessary imports have to be made *within* the function itself - though I think this can be solved with a multiprocessing manager (or worst case, global inspection). \r\n\r\nI also have an interface which allows dynamic creation of contract docstrings / crawlers with different settings inside the same process, which might be useful; but that's something that would probably be better as its own discussion. \r\n  ", "created_at": "2018-01-03T19:57:42Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-09T19:42:34Z", "closed_at": null, "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha":

`get_output_value()` is not an empty list.\r\n\r\nThat is because `self._local_values` , which stores the new values included via `add_*` or `replace_*` methods, is a[`defaultdict(list)`](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/loader/__init__.py#L37). Then, when we call `get_output_value()` for a field only available in the initial item, an empty list will be set for that field in `self._local_values` (because of [this](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/loader/__init__.py#L125)).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis way, we make sure we don't miss fields from the initial item, in case `get_output_value()` gets

We added test reporting to your repo. We have a blog article on [why we are staging repos](https://blog.testspace.com/testspace-and-open-source).\r\n\r\nNote that we contacted you in the past via an email. We thought it would be easier for you (if interested) by using a Pull Request.   \r\n\r\nFew of the benefits using Testspace:\r\n- view all your test results from a single dashboard\r\n- triage and manage your test failures faster\r\n- add more metrics\r\n- leverage built-in analytics \r\n- get a [test badge](https://help.testspace.com/how-to:get-badge) \r\n[![Space Health](https://open.testspace.com/spaces/74470/badge?token=2f48b759d52023674602ea42e90a5508cad6c953)](https://open.testspace.com/spaces/74470?utm_campaign=badge&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=test \"Test Cases\")\r\n\r\nCheckout **your** test results: https://open.testspace.com/projects/TryTestspace:scrapy from our fork.\r\n\r\n**Why** we are doing this: https://blog.testspace.com/testspace-and-open-source \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Give Testspace a try?**\r\n\r\n1. Create **Open** (free) account: https://testspace.com/pricing\r\n2. Add a **New Project** from the list of Github repo's\r\n3. Add a Travis **Environment Variable**: Name: `TS_ORG`  Value: `organization name` - based on subdomain selected in step 1\r\n4.

nofollow=False)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nPassed the same unit tests as the original code when running tox\r\n```\r\n========================================================= 1679 passed, 6 skipped, 14 xfailed in 458.89 seconds =========================================================\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________ summary ________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n  py27: commands succeeded\r\n  congratulations :)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe that scrapy now handle relative url's

For now I've disabled the call to log.err(). If we want to keep logging the error, we'll need to call flushLoggedErrors() -- see http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/trial.html#auto11 .

One test you can see this with is scrapy.tests.test_engine.EngineTest.test_crawler\n\nFor now I can't promise I'll have time to figure out what's going on with leaving the reactor unclean, but I

spider to scrape a small group of job listings from totaljobs.com. I have set up the spider with a single start URL, to bring up the list of jobs I am interested in. From there, I launch a separate request for each page of the results. Within each of these requests, I launch a separate request calling back to a different parse method, to handle the individual job URLs.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm finding is that the start URL and all of the results page requests are handled fine - scrapy connects to the site and returns the page content. However, when it attempts to follow the URLs for each individual job page, scrapy isn't able to form a connection. Within my log file, it states:\r\n\r\n`[<twisted.python.failure.Failure twisted.internet.error.ConnectionLost: Connection to the other side was lost in a non-clean fashion: Connection lost.>]`\r\n\r\nI'm afraid that I don't have a huge amount of programming experience or knowledge of internet protocols etc. so please forgive me for not being able to provide more information on what might be going on here. I have tried changing the TLS connection type; updating to the latest version of scrapy, twisted and OpenSSL; rolling back to previous versions of scrapy, twisted and OpenSSL; rolling back the cryptography version, creating a custom Context Factory and trying various browser agents and proxies. I get the same outcome every time: whenever the URL relates to a specific job page, scrapy cannot connect and I get the above log file output.\r\n\r\nIt may be likely that I am overlooking something very obvious to seasoned scrapers, that is preventing me from connecting with scrapy. I have tried following some of the the advice in these threads:\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/1429](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/1429)\r\n[https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/4458](https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/4458)\r\n[https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/2717](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/2717)\r\n\r\nHowever, some of it is a bit over my head e.g. how to update cipher lists etc. I presume that it is some kind of certification issue, but then again scrapy is able to connect to other URLs on that domain, so I don't know.\r\n\r\nThe code that I've been using to test this is very basic, but here it is anyway:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport scrapy\r\n\r\nclass Test(scrapy.Spider):\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tstart_urls = [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t'https://www.totaljobs.com/job/welder/jark-wakefield-job79229824'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/job/welder/elliott-wragg-ltd-job78969310'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/job/welder/exo-technical-job79019672'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/job/welder/exo-technical-job79074694'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t]\r\n\t\r\n\tname = \"test\"\r\n\r\n\tdef parse(self, response):\r\n\t\tprint 'aaaa'\r\n                yield {'a': 1}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe URLs in the above code **are not** being connected to successfully.\r\n\r\nThe URLs in the below code **are** being connected to successfully.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport scrapy\r\n\r\nclass Test(scrapy.Spider):\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tstart_urls = [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t'https://www.totaljobs.com/jobs/permanent/welder/in-uk'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/jobs/permanent/mig-welder/in-uk'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/jobs/permanent/tig-welder/in-uk'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t]\r\n\t\r\n\tname = \"test\"\r\n\r\n\tdef parse(self, response):\r\n\t\tprint 'aaaa'\r\n                yield {'a': 1}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIt'd be great if someone could replicate this behavior (or not as the case may be) and let me know. Please let me know if I should submit additional details. I apologise, if I have overlooked something really obvious.

been. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I'd like to give back what I can if it's useful. The problem I'm having is I don't know exactly where to post this. I'm not familiar enough with scrapy internals to suggest where to put the feature, or if it's even necessary enough to put into the main code base. It also likely needs one more modification before being ready for a main branch contribution. \r\n\r\nThe problem this solves is something at least a few people seem to have run into:\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35289054/scrapy-crawl-multiple-times-in-long-running-process\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22116493/run-a-scrapy-spider-in-a-celery-task/22202877#22202877\r\n\r\nMy use case is a website which requires a virtually endless process able to use various scrapy functionalities at whim. To solve the problem of restarting the twisted reactor, I essentially took the solutions I could find and rolled everything into an extremely simple decorator. Basically all the end-user needs to do is label the function they'd like to run as a scrapy function, and the decorator handles everything necessary in order to use scrapy in a library capacity:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t@reactor_process(timeout=10)\r\n\tdef execute(self, keyword_list):\r\n\t\t''' Crawl the site specifically for certain keywords '''\r\n\t\tfrom crawlers.backend.spider_interface import construct_spider\r\n\t\tfrom scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess\r\n\r\n\t\tspider = construct_spider(self)\r\n\t\tspider.create_start_urls(keyword_list)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tcrawler  = CrawlerProcess(self.settings)\r\n\t\tdeferred = crawler.crawl(spider)\r\n\t\tdeferred.addBoth(lambda _: crawler._stop_reactor())\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the decorator, the function above would only be able to run once - the reactor engine would complain about being restarted. The one problem is that the necessary imports have to be made *within* the function itself - though I think this can be solved with a multiprocessing manager (or worst case, global inspection). \r\n\r\nI also have an interface which allows dynamic creation of contract docstrings / crawlers with different settings inside the same process, which might be useful; but that's something that would probably be better as its own discussion. \r\n  ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3062/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3061", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3061/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3061/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3061/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3061", "id": 285650331, "number": 3061, "title": "Make autothrottle slow down on HTTP 429 response", "user": {"login": "Matthijsy", "id": 5302372, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5302372?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy", "html_url": "https://github.com/Matthijsy", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2018-01-03T10:39:07Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-12T11:03:18Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/pulls/3061", "html_url": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3061", "diff_url": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3061.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3061.patch"}, "body": "When a response has status 429 (Too Many Requests) it is ignored by the AutoThrottle (because the latency is low, so otherwise the spider will speed up).

has made a lot of things much simpler than they otherwise would have been. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I'd like to give back what I can if it's useful. The problem I'm having is I don't know exactly where to post this. I'm not familiar enough with scrapy internals to suggest where to put the feature, or if it's even necessary enough to put into the main code base. It also likely needs one more modification before being ready for a main branch contribution. \r\n\r\nThe problem this solves is something at least a few people seem to have run into:\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35289054/scrapy-crawl-multiple-times-in-long-running-process\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22116493/run-a-scrapy-spider-in-a-celery-task/22202877#22202877\r\n\r\nMy use case is a website which requires a virtually endless process able to use various scrapy functionalities at whim. To solve the problem of restarting the twisted reactor, I essentially took the solutions I could find and rolled everything into an extremely simple decorator. Basically all the end-user needs to do is label the function they'd like to run as a scrapy function, and the decorator handles everything necessary in order to use scrapy in a library capacity:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t@reactor_process(timeout=10)\r\n\tdef execute(self, keyword_list):\r\n\t\t''' Crawl the site specifically for certain keywords '''\r\n\t\tfrom crawlers.backend.spider_interface import construct_spider\r\n\t\tfrom scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess\r\n\r\n\t\tspider = construct_spider(self)\r\n\t\tspider.create_start_urls(keyword_list)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tcrawler  = CrawlerProcess(self.settings)\r\n\t\tdeferred = crawler.crawl(spider)\r\n\t\tdeferred.addBoth(lambda _: crawler._stop_reactor())\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the decorator, the function above would only be able to run once - the reactor engine would complain about being restarted. The one problem is that the necessary imports have to be made *within* the function itself - though I think this can be solved with a multiprocessing manager (or worst case, global inspection). \r\n\r\nI also have an interface which allows dynamic creation of contract docstrings / crawlers with different settings inside the same process, which might be useful; but that's something that would probably be better as its own discussion. \r\n  ", "created_at": "2018-01-03T19:57:42Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-09T19:42:34Z", "closed_at": null, "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha":

`get_output_value()` is not an empty list.\r\n\r\nThat is because `self._local_values` , which stores the new values included via `add_*` or `replace_*` methods, is a[`defaultdict(list)`](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/loader/__init__.py#L37). Then, when we call `get_output_value()` for a field only available in the initial item, an empty list will be set for that field in `self._local_values` (because of [this](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/loader/__init__.py#L125)).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis way, we make sure we don't miss fields from the initial item, in case `get_output_value()` gets

We added test reporting to your repo. We have a blog article on [why we are staging repos](https://blog.testspace.com/testspace-and-open-source).\r\n\r\nNote that we contacted you in the past via an email. We thought it would be easier for you (if interested) by using a Pull Request.   \r\n\r\nFew of the benefits using Testspace:\r\n- view all your test results from a single dashboard\r\n- triage and manage your test failures faster\r\n- add more metrics\r\n- leverage built-in analytics \r\n- get a [test badge](https://help.testspace.com/how-to:get-badge) \r\n[![Space Health](https://open.testspace.com/spaces/74470/badge?token=2f48b759d52023674602ea42e90a5508cad6c953)](https://open.testspace.com/spaces/74470?utm_campaign=badge&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=test \"Test Cases\")\r\n\r\nCheckout **your** test results: https://open.testspace.com/projects/TryTestspace:scrapy from our fork.\r\n\r\n**Why** we are doing this: https://blog.testspace.com/testspace-and-open-source \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Give Testspace a try?**\r\n\r\n1. Create **Open** (free) account: https://testspace.com/pricing\r\n2. Add a **New Project** from the list of Github repo's\r\n3. Add a Travis **Environment Variable**: Name: `TS_ORG`  Value: `organization name` - based on subdomain selected in step 1\r\n4.

nofollow=False)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nPassed the same unit tests as the original code when running tox\r\n```\r\n========================================================= 1679 passed, 6 skipped, 14 xfailed in 458.89 seconds =========================================================\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________ summary ________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n  py27: commands succeeded\r\n  congratulations :)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe that scrapy now handle relative url's

For now I've disabled the call to log.err(). If we want to keep logging the error, we'll need to call flushLoggedErrors() -- see http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/trial.html#auto11 .

One test you can see this with is scrapy.tests.test_engine.EngineTest.test_crawler\n\nFor now I can't promise I'll have time to figure out what's going on with leaving the reactor unclean, but I

spider to scrape a small group of job listings from totaljobs.com. I have set up the spider with a single start URL, to bring up the list of jobs I am interested in. From there, I launch a separate request for each page of the results. Within each of these requests, I launch a separate request calling back to a different parse method, to handle the individual job URLs.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm finding is that the start URL and all of the results page requests are handled fine - scrapy connects to the site and returns the page content. However, when it attempts to follow the URLs for each individual job page, scrapy isn't able to form a connection. Within my log file, it states:\r\n\r\n`[<twisted.python.failure.Failure twisted.internet.error.ConnectionLost: Connection to the other side was lost in a non-clean fashion: Connection lost.>]`\r\n\r\nI'm afraid that I don't have a huge amount of programming experience or knowledge of internet protocols etc. so please forgive me for not being able to provide more information on what might be going on here. I have tried changing the TLS connection type; updating to the latest version of scrapy, twisted and OpenSSL; rolling back to previous versions of scrapy, twisted and OpenSSL; rolling back the cryptography version, creating a custom Context Factory and trying various browser agents and proxies. I get the same outcome every time: whenever the URL relates to a specific job page, scrapy cannot connect and I get the above log file output.\r\n\r\nIt may be likely that I am overlooking something very obvious to seasoned scrapers, that is preventing me from connecting with scrapy. I have tried following some of the the advice in these threads:\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/1429](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/1429)\r\n[https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/4458](https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/4458)\r\n[https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/2717](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/2717)\r\n\r\nHowever, some of it is a bit over my head e.g. how to update cipher lists etc. I presume that it is some kind of certification issue, but then again scrapy is able to connect to other URLs on that domain, so I don't know.\r\n\r\nThe code that I've been using to test this is very basic, but here it is anyway:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport scrapy\r\n\r\nclass Test(scrapy.Spider):\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tstart_urls = [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t'https://www.totaljobs.com/job/welder/jark-wakefield-job79229824'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/job/welder/elliott-wragg-ltd-job78969310'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/job/welder/exo-technical-job79019672'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/job/welder/exo-technical-job79074694'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t]\r\n\t\r\n\tname = \"test\"\r\n\r\n\tdef parse(self, response):\r\n\t\tprint 'aaaa'\r\n                yield {'a': 1}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe URLs in the above code **are not** being connected to successfully.\r\n\r\nThe URLs in the below code **are** being connected to successfully.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport scrapy\r\n\r\nclass Test(scrapy.Spider):\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tstart_urls = [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t'https://www.totaljobs.com/jobs/permanent/welder/in-uk'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/jobs/permanent/mig-welder/in-uk'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,'https://www.totaljobs.com/jobs/permanent/tig-welder/in-uk'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t]\r\n\t\r\n\tname = \"test\"\r\n\r\n\tdef parse(self, response):\r\n\t\tprint 'aaaa'\r\n                yield {'a': 1}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIt'd be great if someone could replicate this behavior (or not as the case may be) and let me know. Please let me know if I should submit additional details. I apologise, if I have overlooked something really obvious.

been. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I'd like to give back what I can if it's useful. The problem I'm having is I don't know exactly where to post this. I'm not familiar enough with scrapy internals to suggest where to put the feature, or if it's even necessary enough to put into the main code base. It also likely needs one more modification before being ready for a main branch contribution. \r\n\r\nThe problem this solves is something at least a few people seem to have run into:\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35289054/scrapy-crawl-multiple-times-in-long-running-process\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22116493/run-a-scrapy-spider-in-a-celery-task/22202877#22202877\r\n\r\nMy use case is a website which requires a virtually endless process able to use various scrapy functionalities at whim. To solve the problem of restarting the twisted reactor, I essentially took the solutions I could find and rolled everything into an extremely simple decorator. Basically all the end-user needs to do is label the function they'd like to run as a scrapy function, and the decorator handles everything necessary in order to use scrapy in a library capacity:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t@reactor_process(timeout=10)\r\n\tdef execute(self, keyword_list):\r\n\t\t''' Crawl the site specifically for certain keywords '''\r\n\t\tfrom crawlers.backend.spider_interface import construct_spider\r\n\t\tfrom scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess\r\n\r\n\t\tspider = construct_spider(self)\r\n\t\tspider.create_start_urls(keyword_list)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tcrawler  = CrawlerProcess(self.settings)\r\n\t\tdeferred = crawler.crawl(spider)\r\n\t\tdeferred.addBoth(lambda _: crawler._stop_reactor())\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the decorator, the function above would only be able to run once - the reactor engine would complain about being restarted. The one problem is that the necessary imports have to be made *within* the function itself - though I think this can be solved with a multiprocessing manager (or worst case, global inspection). \r\n\r\nI also have an interface which allows dynamic creation of contract docstrings / crawlers with different settings inside the same process, which might be useful; but that's something that would probably be better as its own discussion. \r\n  ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3062/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3061", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3061/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3061/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3061/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3061", "id": 285650331, "number": 3061, "title": "Make autothrottle slow down on HTTP 429 response", "user": {"login": "Matthijsy", "id": 5302372, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5302372?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy", "html_url": "https://github.com/Matthijsy", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Matthijsy/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2018-01-03T10:39:07Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-12T11:03:18Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scrapy/scrapy/pulls/3061", "html_url": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3061", "diff_url": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3061.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/3061.patch"}, "body": "When a response has status 429 (Too Many Requests) it is ignored by the AutoThrottle (because the latency is low, so otherwise the spider will speed up).

has made a lot of things much simpler than they otherwise would have been. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I'd like to give back what I can if it's useful. The problem I'm having is I don't know exactly where to post this. I'm not familiar enough with scrapy internals to suggest where to put the feature, or if it's even necessary enough to put into the main code base. It also likely needs one more modification before being ready for a main branch contribution. \r\n\r\nThe problem this solves is something at least a few people seem to have run into:\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35289054/scrapy-crawl-multiple-times-in-long-running-process\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22116493/run-a-scrapy-spider-in-a-celery-task/22202877#22202877\r\n\r\nMy use case is a website which requires a virtually endless process able to use various scrapy functionalities at whim. To solve the problem of restarting the twisted reactor, I essentially took the solutions I could find and rolled everything into an extremely simple decorator. Basically all the end-user needs to do is label the function they'd like to run as a scrapy function, and the decorator handles everything necessary in order to use scrapy in a library capacity:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t@reactor_process(timeout=10)\r\n\tdef execute(self, keyword_list):\r\n\t\t''' Crawl the site specifically for certain keywords '''\r\n\t\tfrom crawlers.backend.spider_interface import construct_spider\r\n\t\tfrom scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess\r\n\r\n\t\tspider = construct_spider(self)\r\n\t\tspider.create_start_urls(keyword_list)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tcrawler  = CrawlerProcess(self.settings)\r\n\t\tdeferred = crawler.crawl(spider)\r\n\t\tdeferred.addBoth(lambda _: crawler._stop_reactor())\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the decorator, the function above would only be able to run once - the reactor engine would complain about being restarted. The one problem is that the necessary imports have to be made *within* the function itself - though I think this can be solved with a multiprocessing manager (or worst case, global inspection). \r\n\r\nI also have an interface which allows dynamic creation of contract docstrings / crawlers with different settings inside the same process, which might be useful; but that's something that would probably be better as its own discussion. \r\n  ", "created_at": "2018-01-03T19:57:42Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-09T19:42:34Z", "closed_at": null, "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha":

`get_output_value()` is not an empty list.\r\n\r\nThat is because `self._local_values` , which stores the new values included via `add_*` or `replace_*` methods, is a[`defaultdict(list)`](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/loader/__init__.py#L37). Then, when we call `get_output_value()` for a field only available in the initial item, an empty list will be set for that field in `self._local_values` (because of [this](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/loader/__init__.py#L125)).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis way, we make sure we don't miss fields from the initial item, in case `get_output_value()` gets

We added test reporting to your repo. We have a blog article on [why we are staging repos](https://blog.testspace.com/testspace-and-open-source).\r\n\r\nNote that we contacted you in the past via an email. We thought it would be easier for you (if interested) by using a Pull Request.   \r\n\r\nFew of the benefits using Testspace:\r\n- view all your test results from a single dashboard\r\n- triage and manage your test failures faster\r\n- add more metrics\r\n- leverage built-in analytics \r\n- get a [test badge](https://help.testspace.com/how-to:get-badge) \r\n[![Space Health](https://open.testspace.com/spaces/74470/badge?token=2f48b759d52023674602ea42e90a5508cad6c953)](https://open.testspace.com/spaces/74470?utm_campaign=badge&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=test \"Test Cases\")\r\n\r\nCheckout **your** test results: https://open.testspace.com/projects/TryTestspace:scrapy from our fork.\r\n\r\n**Why** we are doing this: https://blog.testspace.com/testspace-and-open-source \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Give Testspace a try?**\r\n\r\n1. Create **Open** (free) account: https://testspace.com/pricing\r\n2. Add a **New Project** from the list of Github repo's\r\n3. Add a Travis **Environment Variable**: Name: `TS_ORG`  Value: `organization name` - based on subdomain selected in step 1\r\n4.

nofollow=False)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nPassed the same unit tests as the original code when running tox\r\n```\r\n========================================================= 1679 passed, 6 skipped, 14 xfailed in 458.89 seconds =========================================================\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________ summary ________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n  py27: commands succeeded\r\n  congratulations :)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe that scrapy now handle relative url's

For now I've disabled the call to log.err(). If we want to keep logging the error, we'll need to call flushLoggedErrors() -- see http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/trial.html#auto11 .

One test you can see this with is scrapy.tests.test_engine.EngineTest.test_crawler\n\nFor now I can't promise I'll have time to figure out what's going on with leaving the reactor unclean, but I
