API update.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't give enough information on what to expect, thus creating uncertainty and needing a developer to first look through commits in history, narrow down to the gem in

This is because `BlockIO` is not truncatable, unlike a response target like `StringIO` or `Tempfile`, and aws-sdk-s3 needs it to be because it retries the whole download from the start.\n\nIn [Shrine][https://github.com/janko-m/shrine] and [tus-ruby-server](https://github.com/janko-m/tus-ruby-server) I'm using aws-sdk-s3's streaming download feature, mainly for streaming the S3 object through a web application. It would be great if these downloads were to be retried in case of network errors in this case as well, especially for tus-ruby-server where the S3 objects will typically be very large.\n\nThis PR adds this functionality. It does so by remembering how many bytes of the content was \"written\" to the response target so far; when the request is retried, part of the response body that has already been written is simply skipped, until it reaches the part it hasn't written yet.\n\nAfter this PR I plan to add support for [range requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests), so that the requests are retried from the last byte offset. But for start I wanted to add this because I didn't know whether all S3 endpoints support range requests, so I thought we would still need this as a safety net.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/issues/1617/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/issues/1615", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-ruby", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/issues/1615/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/issues/1615/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/issues/1615/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/1615", "id": 258139861, "number": 1615, "title": "Allow DynamoDB to write empty set attribute values, part 2", "user": {"login": "makeready", "id": 5519704, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5519704?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/makeready", "html_url": "https://github.com/makeready", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/makeready/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/makeready/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/makeready/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/makeready/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/makeready/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/makeready/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/makeready/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/makeready/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/makeready/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 600645612, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/labels/Version%203", "name": "Version 3", "color": "fef2c0", "default": false}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2017-09-15T19:23:34Z", "updated_at": "2017-12-14T19:54:20Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pulls/1615", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/1615", "diff_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/1615.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/1615.patch"}, "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nFirst off, thanks for merging in my original PR for this feature.

So, it doesn't guarantee a returned pathname points the pathname of File object's corresponding file.\r\n\r\nFor instance, File may have replaced with another file after original `File` object opened. Also, `File.open` with `File::TMPFILE` option don't create directory entry for created files (see `open(2)` manual). On current Ruby implementation, `O_TMPFILE` file objects returns a path of directory used to create a temporarily file.\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nFile.write '/tmp/foo', 'a'\r\nFile.write '/tmp/foo2',

`IO#dup` (`dup(2)`), `IO#rewind` and `IO#read` for calculating digest from `IO` object, always\r\n- Ensure binary mode when calculating digests\r\n- For non `IO` like objects, use #to_str to ensure the value is a `String` like object.\r\n\r\nSee also today's documentation change to note this pitfall. https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/efd36678e6041593a6b9cd64bdbe4318f1e7ad0e\r\n\r\n[1]:

This strips out whitespace that may be semantically significant, such as in the case of sending YAML documents via SQS. The setting proposed in this pull request strips only trailing spaces from contained content, which should leave most real-world white-space significant documents semantically intact. It certainly fixes Ox for use with YAML over SQS.\r\n\r\nThis proposed change explicitly changes a prior fix made in #1496, related to issue #1495. ~~I was unable to locate the \"kitchen_sink\" test harness referenced there, so was unable to manually check this change against whatever the undesirable behavior for that issue was.~~ [Edit: I see now that KITCHEN_SINK is a Travis target.]",

writable response target.\n\n```rb\nobject.get do |chunk|\n  # streaming\nend\n```\n\nNormally aws-sdk-s3 retries any failed downloads in case of network errors, but not for streaming downloads. This is because `BlockIO` is not truncatable, unlike a response target like `StringIO` or `Tempfile`, and aws-sdk-s3 needs it to be because it retries the whole download from the start.\n\nIn [Shrine][https://github.com/janko-m/shrine] and [tus-ruby-server](https://github.com/janko-m/tus-ruby-server) I'm using aws-sdk-s3's streaming download feature, mainly for streaming the S3 object through a web application. It would be great if these downloads were to be retried in case of network errors in this case as well, especially for tus-ruby-server where the S3 objects will typically be very large.\n\nThis PR adds this functionality. It does so by remembering how many bytes of the content was \"written\" to the response target so far; when the request is retried, part of the response body that has already been written is simply skipped, until it reaches the part it hasn't written yet.\n\nAfter this PR I plan to add support for [range requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests), so that the requests are retried from the last byte offset. But for start I wanted to add this because I didn't know whether all S3 endpoints support range requests, so I thought we would still need this as a safety net.", "created_at": "2017-09-19T12:15:07Z",

After tracing through the error it became clear that I forgot to create the new AttributeValue definitions to support empty sets. This PR is to fix those omissions.\r\n\r\nBTW, I wasn't clear on how to test this change - param_validator_spec uses a fake list of shapes, and client_api.rb doesn't have a corresponding test file, which means the definitions \r\nin client_api aren't actually tested anywhere. If you'd like me to write an integration test to cover it I can, but I assume this feature is too minor to deserve an integration test.\r\n\r\nThanks", "created_at": "2017-09-15T19:23:34Z",

object. So, it doesn't guarantee a returned pathname points the pathname of File object's corresponding file.\r\n\r\nFor instance, File may have replaced with another file after original `File` object opened. Also, `File.open` with `File::TMPFILE` option don't create directory entry for created files (see `open(2)` manual). On current Ruby implementation, `O_TMPFILE` file objects returns a path of directory used to create a temporarily file.\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nFile.write '/tmp/foo', 'a'\r\nFile.write '/tmp/foo2', 'a'\r\nopen('/tmp/foo', 'r') do |io|\r\n  File.rename '/tmp/foo2', '/tmp/foo'\r\n  s3.put_object(..., body: io) # Reads different file!\r\nend\r\n\r\nopen('/tmp', File::RDWR | File::TMPFILE) do |io|\r\n  s3.put_object(..., body: io) #=> error: Errno::EISDIR\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch changes Checksums module to correctly handle IO objects for\r\ncalculating digests.\r\n\r\n- Use `IO#dup` (`dup(2)`), `IO#rewind` and `IO#read` for calculating digest from `IO` object, always\r\n- Ensure binary mode when calculating digests\r\n- For non `IO` like objects, use #to_str to ensure the value is a `String` like object.\r\n\r\nSee also today's documentation change to note this pitfall. https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/efd36678e6041593a6b9cd64bdbe4318f1e7ad0e\r\n\r\n[1]:
