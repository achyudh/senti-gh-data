Everything works, but this extra junk is included in the data files my application uses, which makes it difficult to read if I ever decide to make the data files public for editing or debugging.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n* AWSSDK.Core version used: MonoAndroid10 AWSSDK.Core.3.3.19.1 & 3.3.21.6 (Net45 is OK)\r\n* Service assembly and version used: ???\r\n* Operating System and version: Windows 10\r\n* Visual Studio version: Visual Studio Community 2017\r\n* Targeted .NET platform:  Microsoft .NET 4.6.1.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core Info\r\nProblem arose on Xamarin Android using .NET Core but has been reproduced in a Windows Console application referencing MonoAndroid10 with .NET Framework 4.6.1. So .NET Core should be irrelevant.\r\n\r\n[logging]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/net-dg-config-other.html", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/837/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/835", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/835/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/835/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/835/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/835", "id": 288629327, "number": 835, "title": "Unable To Post Files", "user": {"login": "JGuthrie-Bluebeck", "id": 13253400, "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13253400?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/JGuthrie-Bluebeck", "html_url": "https://github.com/JGuthrie-Bluebeck", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JGuthrie-Bluebeck/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JGuthrie-Bluebeck/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JGuthrie-Bluebeck/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JGuthrie-Bluebeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JGuthrie-Bluebeck/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JGuthrie-Bluebeck/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JGuthrie-Bluebeck/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JGuthrie-Bluebeck/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JGuthrie-Bluebeck/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 310498135, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/labels/Information%20Requested", "name": "Information Requested", "color": "eb6420", "default": false}, {"id": 330382049, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/labels/Unity", "name": "Unity", "color": "5319e7", "default": false}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2018-01-15T15:20:49Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-17T18:14:28Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "body": "Folks this just feels like the SDK is broken and after reading issues like below it makes me want to move to another provider.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/332\r\n\r\nFor me the problem is pretty clearly that in the web request it is trying to set headers that it shouldn't be touching:\r\n\r\nInvalidOperationException: Cannot override system-specified headers\r\n\r\nLooks like the culprit is Content-Length.\r\n\r\nThis happening when I try to put anything into my bucket (I can get from it just fine).

from the class **HttpWebRequestMessage** (sdk\\src\\Core\\Amazon.Runtime\\Pipeline\\HttpHandler\\_mobile\\HttpRequestMessageFactory.cs) is throwing a TaskCanceledException either for a timeout defined in the HttpClient or when the Cancel method is called in the CancelationTokenSource. This behaviour makes hard to find the origin of errors.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->\r\n<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->\r\nThrowing an exception whit the proper error.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\r\n<!--- Include full errors, uncaught exceptions, stack traces, and relevant logs -->\r\n<!--- To turn on SDK logging, follow instructions provided [here][logging] -->\r\n<!--- If service responses are relevant, please include Fiddler-captured wirelogs -->\r\n<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n<!--- Not required, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug, -->\r\n<!--- or ideas how to implement the addition or change -->\r\nI know the workaround is hard because internally the HttpClient is cancelling the token when the timeout is reached.

On further analysis we have determined that the cause of the problem is the SDK is not retrying requests that timeout regardless of the MaxErrorRetry value configured.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Unit tests have been added to RetryHandlerTests.cs in this pull request\r\n- Further testing has been done by executing a test console app that queries AWS Dynamodb endpoints via a Fiddler proxy. The Fiddler proxy was configured to add a delay to certain requests to induce HTTP timeouts. Analysis of the AWS log output showed that the current Dynamodb client fails to retry on HTTP timeouts but does correctly after applying this pull request.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] My code follows the code style of this project\r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly\r\n- [x] I have read the **README** document\r\n- [x] I have added tests to cover my changes\r\n- [x] All new and existing tests passed\r\n\r\n## License\r\n- [x] I confirm that this pull request can be released under the Apache 2 license\r\n\r\n[issues]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues\r\n[license]: http://aws.amazon.com/apache2.0/\r\n[cla]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/807/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/806", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/806/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/806/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/806/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/806", "id": 278554640, "number": 806, "title": "AWS C:\\Users\\{name}\\.aws\\credentials file always open", "user": {"login": "Bluestreak2k5", "id": 825940, "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/825940?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bluestreak2k5", "html_url": "https://github.com/Bluestreak2k5", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bluestreak2k5/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bluestreak2k5/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bluestreak2k5/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bluestreak2k5/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bluestreak2k5/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bluestreak2k5/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bluestreak2k5/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bluestreak2k5/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bluestreak2k5/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 627630783, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/labels/Visual%20Studio%20Toolkit", "name": "Visual Studio Toolkit", "color": "98dafc", "default": false}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2017-12-01T18:29:32Z", "updated_at": "2017-12-12T01:12:04Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "body": "I have Visual Studio working with AWS Toolkit using an AWS Role credientials.\r\n\r\nI have a batch process that grabs credientials from a machine every hour and stores in the default location to run commands.

enable you to create one or more read-only copies of your database instance within the same AWS Region or in a different AWS Region. Updates made to the source database are asynchronously copied to the Read Replicas. In addition to providing scalability for read-heavy workloads, you can choose to promote a Read Replica to become standalone a DB instance when needed.Amazon RDS Multi-AZ Deployments provide enhanced availability for database instances within a single AWS Region. With Multi-AZ, your data is synchronously replicated to a standby in a different Availability Zone (AZ). In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, minimizing disruption to your applications.You can now combine Read Replicas with Multi-AZ as part of a disaster recovery strategy for your production databases. A well-designed and tested plan is critical for maintaining business continuity after a disaster. Since Read Replicas can also be created in different regions than the source database, your Read Replica can be promoted to become the new production database in case of a regional disruption.You can also combine Read Replicas with Multi-AZ for your database engine upgrade process. You can create a Read Replica of your production database instance and upgrade it to a new database engine version. When the upgrade is complete, you can stop applications, promote the Read Replica to a standalone database instance and switch over your applications. Since the database instance is already a Multi-AZ deployment, no additional steps are needed.For more information, see the Amazon RDS User Guide.", "tree": {"sha":

WebException statuses in the DefaultRetryPolicy so that it will retry on HTTP timeouts.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nWe have had an ongoing issue with Dynamodb WebException timeouts. On further analysis we have determined that the cause of the problem is the SDK is not retrying requests that timeout regardless of the MaxErrorRetry value configured.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Unit tests have been added to RetryHandlerTests.cs in this pull request\r\n- Further testing has been done by executing a test console app that queries AWS Dynamodb endpoints via a Fiddler proxy. The Fiddler proxy was configured to add a delay to certain requests to induce HTTP timeouts. Analysis of the AWS log output showed that the current Dynamodb client fails to retry on HTTP timeouts but does correctly after applying this pull request.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] My code follows the code style of this project\r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly\r\n- [x] I have read the **README** document\r\n- [x] I have added tests to cover my changes\r\n- [x] All new and existing tests passed\r\n\r\n## License\r\n- [x] I confirm that this pull request can be released under the Apache 2 license\r\n\r\n[issues]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues\r\n[license]: http://aws.amazon.com/apache2.0/\r\n[cla]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement", "created_at": "2017-12-04T15:32:17Z", "updated_at": "2017-12-04T15:32:17Z", "closed_at": null, "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha": "435905462a5ae47141df52898eecd0a9111e3770", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "milestone": null, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/pulls/807/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/pulls/807/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/807/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-net/statuses/ed041e738c5f9058719fd2171342afd012dc51fd", "head": {"label": "devodo:timeout_retry", "ref": "timeout_retry", "sha": "ed041e738c5f9058719fd2171342afd012dc51fd", "user": {"login": "devodo", "id": 5979609, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5979609?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo", "html_url": "https://github.com/devodo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 112329644, "name": "aws-sdk-net", "full_name": "devodo/aws-sdk-net", "owner": {"login": "devodo", "id": 5979609, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5979609?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo", "html_url": "https://github.com/devodo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/devodo/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "private": false, "html_url": "https://github.com/devodo/aws-sdk-net", "description": "The official AWS SDK for .NET.

a general summary of your changes in the Title above -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis change adds a check when composing a request URL and includes an intervening \"/\" between the base URL and resource path if there is not one included in either of those values already.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nThis change is a fix for a bug that arises when an S3 request has a ServiceURL containing a subdirectory specified,  ForcePathStyle set to true, and v4 signing enabled. \r\n\r\nThe CanonicalResourcePath is created for the AWS4Signer  by combining the ServiceURL with the ResourcePath (the BucketName and the Key) using CanonicalizeResourcePath at AWSSDKUtils.cs:282. Here it is assumed that there is no trailing  \"/\" in the ServiceURL or leading \"/\" in the BucketName/ResourcePath as one is placed in between them during concatenation. \r\n\r\nWhen the same request is composing the url against which the request will be made, these same values (ServiceURL and ResourcePath beginning with BucketName) are combined at AmazonServiceClient.cs:505.

"body": "Request marshaling is stateless by design and can be turned into a singleton like the response marshaling.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nFor educational purposes I was trying to understand the inner working of the SDK. I realized that the response marshalers are singletons. I was wondering why the request marshalers haven't been made singletons as well. I analyzed a few and came to the conclusion all of those can be made singletons by design since the state they gatter is per method invication. So I went ahead and changed the generator to turn the request marshalers into singletons as well. This will save an allocation per method call on the SDK for each service.\r\n\r\nFurthermore while testing out my changes I got tired of waiting for the generator so I implemented the generation calls on the driver with a Parallel.ForEach wich drastically reduces the generation time.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n* Less allocations on the hot path (one less object allocation per API call)\r\n* More speed while generating the SDK types\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n* Run the generator and compile the SDK (that's all I did)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
