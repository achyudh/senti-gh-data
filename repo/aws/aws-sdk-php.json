This is not a problem with non-NFS mounts and it is only a problem if you attempt to delete the folder in which the open file handler is using.\r\n\r\n**File download example use case:**\r\n* Create a temporary directory on the NFS mount.\r\n* Use `\\Aws\\S3\\S3Client::getObject` to download an object *that does not exist in S3*.  Set `SaveAs` to a file path within the temporary directory on the NFS mount.\r\n* Delete the temporary directory by iterating files and deleting each one.  Once the directory is empty, remove the directory.\r\n\r\n*Workaround*: instead of passing in a file path into `SaveAs`, pass in the file `resource` handler itself and ensure it is closed after calling `\\Aws\\S3\\S3Client::getObject`.\r\n\r\n**Multipart upload example use case:**\r\n* Create a temporary directory on the NFS mount.\r\n* Use `\\Aws\\S3\\S3ClientTrait::upload` to upload a large file which would trigger multipart upload (16Mb or larger).\r\n* Delete the temporary directory by iterating files and deleting each one.  Once the directory is empty, remove the directory.\r\n\r\n*Workaround*: None found, need to avoid using multipart uploads by using `\\Aws\\S3\\S3Client::putObject`.\r\n\r\n**Example error:**\r\nBoth of the above use cases result in an error that looks like this:\r\n> Warning: unlink(/path/to/directory/being/deleted/.nfs676dc60d2899deb8000000c5): Device or resource busy in /path/to/script.php on line X\r\n\r\nSome info about the `.nfs` files, http://nfs.sourceforge.net/#faq_d2\r\n\r\n**Solutions:**\r\n* Update the SDK to close these?\r\n* Is it possible for me to add middleware or listen to some events to automatically close these?\r\n* Others? Open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nCheers and thanks for the help.

"closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "body": "The multipart uploader does some 'special' handling of streams I'd like to discuss.\n\nStreams are only treated as seekable if the underlying resource is a filehandle (\"wrapper_type = plainfile\", see [AbstractUploader::getUploadCommands()](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/blob/master/src/Multipart/AbstractUploader.php#L46)). In the MultipartUploader implementations for S3 and Glacier there is even access to the underlying url and a new stream is created opening the file for each part, bypassing the original stream (see [MultipartUploader::createPart()](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/blob/master/src/S3/MultipartUploader.php#L90)).\n\nAs a result, all streams that don't have an underlying file are first copied into a new stream backed by \"php://temp\". That means they are written into a temporary file in a location provided by sys_get_temp_dir(). PHP writes the data to disk if the size is larger than 2 MB which is the case for every but maybe the last part of a multipart upload.\n\nThis all brings (a) latency because of copying data to disk, (b) additional space requirements on disk, (c) additional open filehandles and (d) the risk of the disk running full. This is done even if the stream is declared as seekable by it's implementation. And in case of an error and restarting the uploader all this buffering is repeated for parts that are still to be transmitted.\n\nIs there a reason for doing this and depending on the underlying source of a stream? Shouldn't it be the responsibility of the stream's implementation to handle all that?\n\nThe only reason I can think of is that multiple streams all have their own seek position and don't interfere with other consumers of the underlying file in an async program execution context. But shouldn't it be sufficient to call seek() before reading from the stream to make sure it is back in the right position? I am not aware of current multithreading features in other php implementations (HHVM, etc) but at least in plain old PHP I have no situation in mind where a seek() directly followed by a read() in the same \"unit of work\" should be disturbed by other code re-seeking the stream.\n\nFor non-seekable streams I can see that this buffering is necessary because the parts are uploaded concurrently. But if the source stream is seekable I don't think all this is needed.\n\nIn my case (and the reason I am writing all this) I have a seekable stream implementation that handles reading parts of a large file from multiple third-party API calls. Providing that stream to the multipart uploader first buffers the parts on disk which has the high risk of the disk running full in case of multiple concurrent requests in my application. This leaves me with either implementing multipart uploads using the low-level API myself or creating a stream wrapper for my stream implementation faking to be a \"plainfile\".\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1101/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1081", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1081/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1081/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1081/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1081", "id": 175738215, "number": 1081, "title": "Using the SDK for CloudSearch is a pain", "user": {"login": "assembledadam", "id": 729240, "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/729240?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam", "html_url": "https://github.com/assembledadam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 19969646, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/labels/feature-request", "name": "feature-request", "color": "009800", "default": false}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2016-09-08T12:15:18Z", "updated_at": "2016-09-09T18:52:38Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "body": "A snippet from a call like this:\n\n```\n$cloudSearchClient->search([\n    'query' => \"(phrase field=_id 'some-permalink')\",\n    'queryParser' => 'structured',\n])->get('hits');\n```\n\nGives me this result:\n\n```\narray:2 [\n  \"id\" => \"some-permalink\"\n  \"fields\" => array:10 [\n    \"category\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"screenshots\"\n    ]\n    \"permalink\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"some-permalink\"\n    ]\n    \"date\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"2016-06-21T11:25:22Z\"\n    ]\n    \"site_permalink\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"videogamer\"\n    ]\n    \"created_at\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"2016-06-21T11:24:40Z\"\n    ]\n    \"subtype\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"images\"\n    ]\n    \"keywords\" => array:2 [\n      0 => \"dead by daylight\"\n      1 => \"pc\"\n    ]\n    \"name_en\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"Dead by Daylight Screenshots\"\n    ]\n    \"type\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"content\"\n    ]\n    \"body_en\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"Check out these screenshots from Dead by Daylight\"\n    ]\n  ]\n]\n```\n\nWhy on earth is every result field an array?

Or in a years time when some is using 3.0?\n> \n> You can't (and shouldn't) have to guarantee perfect backwards-compatibility between all future versions.\n\nThe SDK should be viewed as a complete set by itself. Once SDK 2.x has complete support for all services, you should plan to migrate fully, and all of the 2.x code in your project should all come from the same version of the SDK.\n\nSDK 1.x started life in 2005 as a third-party open-source project called Tarzan. That codebase lasted for 7 years, and we expect that the code that we've recently shipped should last us another several years \u2014 even if we eventually version it as 3.0, 4.0, etc.\n\nThe reason why this particular change is so impactful is because of the changes that occurred in the PHP language when 5.3 came out. Switching to namespaces forced us to break everything. From the changes we've seen in 5.4 and in previews of 5.5, we don't see changes of this magnitude having to happen again for a long time.\n\n> What strategy should I use for using SDKs 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, etc all in the same PHP context side-by-side? Is there anything that can be done upstream (by you) to help?\n\nYou shouldn't. Any SDK code that you use should all be the same version of 1.x or all the same version of 2.x (and possibly 3.x and 4.x). Again, it took us 7 years before we had to go back and do a ground-up rewrite of the code.\n\nInstead of thinking in terms of version numbers, think in terms of generations.\n\n**First Generation:**\n- Tarzan 1.0 (2005)\n- Tarzan 1.1 (2005)\n- Tarzan 2.0 (2008)\n- CloudFusion 2.5 (2010; renamed)\n- AWS SDK for PHP 1.0 (2010; renamed; formerly CloudFusion 3.0)\n- ...\n- AWS SDK for PHP 1.5.15 (2012; equivalent to CloudFusion 3.5.15)\n\n**Second Generation:**\n- AWS SDK for PHP 2.0 (2012; equivalent to Guzzle-based SDK for AWS 1.0)\n- ...\n\nWe currently provide compatibility for jumping between _generations_ of SDK. You should use all the same version of one generation alongside all the same version of the other generation. Even though this _appears_ to be a jump from 1.x to 2.x, you shouldn't necessarily expect the same kinds of changes from our eventual 3.0.\n\nIt would be reasonable to suggest that a future 3.0 release might leverage Traits (new in PHP 5.4; not compatible with 5.3). In this case, _some_ changes might be required, but we anticipate them being _adjustments_ to the existing SDK 2.0 API, instead of being a wholesale rewrite that we're presently experiencing with the move from the older Tarzan/CloudFusion codebase to the new Guzzle-based codebase.\n\nAny time we've been forced to release a breaking change, we've made it a point to call it out **very specifically** in our release notes, change log, API reference documentation, and other update-related documentation. On the off-chance that a minor breaking change has to be made, we will continue to thoroughly document those changes in the places that we think people will look (it's _always_ a good idea to read release notes before upgrading, but we know that some customers don't).\n\nIf you're using Composer to install either SDK (definitely a best practice, and the de-facto successor to PEAR/Pyrus), it would be wise to scope updates down to minor releases (e.g., 1.5._, 2.0._) to make sure that you don't jump up to a new major version (e.g., 1._, 2._) without knowing it (whereas I'm defining version numbers as `<architecture>.<major>.<minor>`, like the Linux kernel, Mac OS X, and Firefox releases before 4.0).\n\nMake sense? :)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/10178857/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/10208466", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/5#issuecomment-10208466", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/5", "id": 10208466, "user": {"login": "ashishtilara", "id": 1509613, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1509613?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara", "html_url": "https://github.com/ashishtilara", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2012-11-08T22:47:32Z", "updated_at": "2012-11-08T22:47:32Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "@skyzyx Pardon my frustration, but this doesn't really answer my concerns. We have a massive code base, and it is literally impractical for us to move wholesale to a new library version every time you push out an update. We will likely always have classes that use 1.4, others using 1.5 and now potentially new classes using 2.0, and these classes all need to be able to used together.

We've never had anyone come to us that required dependencies on a full gamut of different versions of the SDK within the same codebase. I'd like to better understand what the problem actually is and what solutions you might have in mind. You had mentioned including the version in the namespace, but I have not seen any other libraries that are doing this, and it also is not really compatible with PSR-0. Are their any _other_ libraries that you consume that allow you to run multiple versions in the same codebase? I'd be willing to look at those for ideas, but I'm not personally aware of any other libraries out there that support the type of behavior you are asking for. I really would like to see what we can do to help you, but I'm not sure if there is bulletproof solution that is beneficial to everyone else, that doesn't involve you having to do some refactoring at some point.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/10237709/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/10348761", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/7#issuecomment-10348761", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/7", "id": 10348761, "user": {"login": "jeremeamia", "id": 107867, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/107867?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia", "html_url": "https://github.com/jeremeamia", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremeamia/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2012-11-13T23:30:42Z", "updated_at": "2012-11-13T23:30:42Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "I responded to your forum post earlier today with a fix: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=109616&tstart=0\n\nThe docs are wrong for the Body option.

In my `$options` array, I now have:\n\n``` php\n$options = array(\n    'acl' => CannedAcl::PUBLIC_READ,\n    'Content-Type' => 'audio/mpeg',\n    'key' => 'audio/a-test-podcast.mp3',\n    'success_action_redirect' => (string) $container['misc_config']->main->base_url . 'upload/success/',\n    'success_action_status' => 201,\n    'filename' => '^'\n);\n```\n\nDon\u2019t ask my have I managed to arrive at this solution, since it\u2019s not documented anywhere I don\u2019t think!\n\nAlthough I am now faced with yet another issue. When using a Flash-based uploaded, how can I actually redirect on successful upload? My JavaScript function to instantiate Uploadify looks like this:\n\n``` js\n$('#file_upload').uploadify({\n    'buttonClass': 'button',\n    'buttonText': 'Upload',\n    'formData': <?php echo json_encode($formInputs); ?>,\n    'fileObjName': 'file',\n    'fileTypeExts': '*.mp3',\n    'height': 36,\n    'multi': false,\n    'onUploadError': function(file, errorCode, errorMsg, errorString) {\n        console.log('onUploadError', file, errorCode, errorMsg, errorString);\n    },\n    'onUploadSuccess': function(file, data, response) {\n        console.log('onUploadSuccess', file, data, response);\n    },\n    'swf': '/assets/site/swf/uploadify.swf',\n    'uploader': '<?php echo $uploadPath; ?>',\n    'width': 120\n});\n```\n\nThe content of my success page is logged in the console as the `data` argument, but I\u2019d like to actually _redirect_ to that page, rather than having the response available to me in JavaScript. Is this an issue with Flash, JavaScript, Uploadify, what?\n\nFinally, how can I enforce that only files with an **.mp3** extension are uploaded?\n", "reactions": {"url":

It might be better to use the [FileInfo](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.fileinfo.php) so file extensions aren't needed.\n\nSo perhaps a feature similar to this, or maybe the ability to add a callback function to the stream context options which can inspect and modify the parameters before an object is written would be nice.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/comments/2959540/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/comments/2959949", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/commit/04007c23ce147a7ce1e9d6b2750ff5f37b0ddb60#commitcomment-2959949", "id": 2959949, "user": {"login": "mtdowling", "id": 190930, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/190930?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling", "html_url": "https://github.com/mtdowling", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "position": 236, "line": 236, "path": "src/Aws/S3/StreamWrapper.php", "commit_id": "04007c23ce147a7ce1e9d6b2750ff5f37b0ddb60", "created_at": "2013-04-07T00:39:59Z", "updated_at": "2013-04-07T00:39:59Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "Thanks for pointing this out.

This is not a problem with non-NFS mounts and it is only a problem if you attempt to delete the folder in which the open file handler is using.\r\n\r\n**File download example use case:**\r\n* Create a temporary directory on the NFS mount.\r\n* Use `\\Aws\\S3\\S3Client::getObject` to download an object *that does not exist in S3*.  Set `SaveAs` to a file path within the temporary directory on the NFS mount.\r\n* Delete the temporary directory by iterating files and deleting each one.  Once the directory is empty, remove the directory.\r\n\r\n*Workaround*: instead of passing in a file path into `SaveAs`, pass in the file `resource` handler itself and ensure it is closed after calling `\\Aws\\S3\\S3Client::getObject`.\r\n\r\n**Multipart upload example use case:**\r\n* Create a temporary directory on the NFS mount.\r\n* Use `\\Aws\\S3\\S3ClientTrait::upload` to upload a large file which would trigger multipart upload (16Mb or larger).\r\n* Delete the temporary directory by iterating files and deleting each one.  Once the directory is empty, remove the directory.\r\n\r\n*Workaround*: None found, need to avoid using multipart uploads by using `\\Aws\\S3\\S3Client::putObject`.\r\n\r\n**Example error:**\r\nBoth of the above use cases result in an error that looks like this:\r\n> Warning: unlink(/path/to/directory/being/deleted/.nfs676dc60d2899deb8000000c5): Device or resource busy in /path/to/script.php on line X\r\n\r\nSome info about the `.nfs` files, http://nfs.sourceforge.net/#faq_d2\r\n\r\n**Solutions:**\r\n* Update the SDK to close these?\r\n* Is it possible for me to add middleware or listen to some events to automatically close these?\r\n* Others? Open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nCheers and thanks for the help.

"closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "body": "The multipart uploader does some 'special' handling of streams I'd like to discuss.\n\nStreams are only treated as seekable if the underlying resource is a filehandle (\"wrapper_type = plainfile\", see [AbstractUploader::getUploadCommands()](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/blob/master/src/Multipart/AbstractUploader.php#L46)). In the MultipartUploader implementations for S3 and Glacier there is even access to the underlying url and a new stream is created opening the file for each part, bypassing the original stream (see [MultipartUploader::createPart()](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/blob/master/src/S3/MultipartUploader.php#L90)).\n\nAs a result, all streams that don't have an underlying file are first copied into a new stream backed by \"php://temp\". That means they are written into a temporary file in a location provided by sys_get_temp_dir(). PHP writes the data to disk if the size is larger than 2 MB which is the case for every but maybe the last part of a multipart upload.\n\nThis all brings (a) latency because of copying data to disk, (b) additional space requirements on disk, (c) additional open filehandles and (d) the risk of the disk running full. This is done even if the stream is declared as seekable by it's implementation. And in case of an error and restarting the uploader all this buffering is repeated for parts that are still to be transmitted.\n\nIs there a reason for doing this and depending on the underlying source of a stream? Shouldn't it be the responsibility of the stream's implementation to handle all that?\n\nThe only reason I can think of is that multiple streams all have their own seek position and don't interfere with other consumers of the underlying file in an async program execution context. But shouldn't it be sufficient to call seek() before reading from the stream to make sure it is back in the right position? I am not aware of current multithreading features in other php implementations (HHVM, etc) but at least in plain old PHP I have no situation in mind where a seek() directly followed by a read() in the same \"unit of work\" should be disturbed by other code re-seeking the stream.\n\nFor non-seekable streams I can see that this buffering is necessary because the parts are uploaded concurrently. But if the source stream is seekable I don't think all this is needed.\n\nIn my case (and the reason I am writing all this) I have a seekable stream implementation that handles reading parts of a large file from multiple third-party API calls. Providing that stream to the multipart uploader first buffers the parts on disk which has the high risk of the disk running full in case of multiple concurrent requests in my application. This leaves me with either implementing multipart uploads using the low-level API myself or creating a stream wrapper for my stream implementation faking to be a \"plainfile\".\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1101/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1081", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1081/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1081/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1081/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/1081", "id": 175738215, "number": 1081, "title": "Using the SDK for CloudSearch is a pain", "user": {"login": "assembledadam", "id": 729240, "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/729240?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam", "html_url": "https://github.com/assembledadam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/assembledadam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 19969646, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/labels/feature-request", "name": "feature-request", "color": "009800", "default": false}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2016-09-08T12:15:18Z", "updated_at": "2016-09-09T18:52:38Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "body": "A snippet from a call like this:\n\n```\n$cloudSearchClient->search([\n    'query' => \"(phrase field=_id 'some-permalink')\",\n    'queryParser' => 'structured',\n])->get('hits');\n```\n\nGives me this result:\n\n```\narray:2 [\n  \"id\" => \"some-permalink\"\n  \"fields\" => array:10 [\n    \"category\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"screenshots\"\n    ]\n    \"permalink\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"some-permalink\"\n    ]\n    \"date\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"2016-06-21T11:25:22Z\"\n    ]\n    \"site_permalink\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"videogamer\"\n    ]\n    \"created_at\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"2016-06-21T11:24:40Z\"\n    ]\n    \"subtype\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"images\"\n    ]\n    \"keywords\" => array:2 [\n      0 => \"dead by daylight\"\n      1 => \"pc\"\n    ]\n    \"name_en\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"Dead by Daylight Screenshots\"\n    ]\n    \"type\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"content\"\n    ]\n    \"body_en\" => array:1 [\n      0 => \"Check out these screenshots from Dead by Daylight\"\n    ]\n  ]\n]\n```\n\nWhy on earth is every result field an array?

And that would probably be too much of a coincidence in our case...\n\nDoes anyone know about this problem..? I can't even say if it's a problem in the SDK or something else.

Or in a years time when some is using 3.0?\n> \n> You can't (and shouldn't) have to guarantee perfect backwards-compatibility between all future versions.\n\nThe SDK should be viewed as a complete set by itself. Once SDK 2.x has complete support for all services, you should plan to migrate fully, and all of the 2.x code in your project should all come from the same version of the SDK.\n\nSDK 1.x started life in 2005 as a third-party open-source project called Tarzan. That codebase lasted for 7 years, and we expect that the code that we've recently shipped should last us another several years \u2014 even if we eventually version it as 3.0, 4.0, etc.\n\nThe reason why this particular change is so impactful is because of the changes that occurred in the PHP language when 5.3 came out. Switching to namespaces forced us to break everything. From the changes we've seen in 5.4 and in previews of 5.5, we don't see changes of this magnitude having to happen again for a long time.\n\n> What strategy should I use for using SDKs 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, etc all in the same PHP context side-by-side? Is there anything that can be done upstream (by you) to help?\n\nYou shouldn't. Any SDK code that you use should all be the same version of 1.x or all the same version of 2.x (and possibly 3.x and 4.x). Again, it took us 7 years before we had to go back and do a ground-up rewrite of the code.\n\nInstead of thinking in terms of version numbers, think in terms of generations.\n\n**First Generation:**\n- Tarzan 1.0 (2005)\n- Tarzan 1.1 (2005)\n- Tarzan 2.0 (2008)\n- CloudFusion 2.5 (2010; renamed)\n- AWS SDK for PHP 1.0 (2010; renamed; formerly CloudFusion 3.0)\n- ...\n- AWS SDK for PHP 1.5.15 (2012; equivalent to CloudFusion 3.5.15)\n\n**Second Generation:**\n- AWS SDK for PHP 2.0 (2012; equivalent to Guzzle-based SDK for AWS 1.0)\n- ...\n\nWe currently provide compatibility for jumping between _generations_ of SDK. You should use all the same version of one generation alongside all the same version of the other generation. Even though this _appears_ to be a jump from 1.x to 2.x, you shouldn't necessarily expect the same kinds of changes from our eventual 3.0.\n\nIt would be reasonable to suggest that a future 3.0 release might leverage Traits (new in PHP 5.4; not compatible with 5.3). In this case, _some_ changes might be required, but we anticipate them being _adjustments_ to the existing SDK 2.0 API, instead of being a wholesale rewrite that we're presently experiencing with the move from the older Tarzan/CloudFusion codebase to the new Guzzle-based codebase.\n\nAny time we've been forced to release a breaking change, we've made it a point to call it out **very specifically** in our release notes, change log, API reference documentation, and other update-related documentation. On the off-chance that a minor breaking change has to be made, we will continue to thoroughly document those changes in the places that we think people will look (it's _always_ a good idea to read release notes before upgrading, but we know that some customers don't).\n\nIf you're using Composer to install either SDK (definitely a best practice, and the de-facto successor to PEAR/Pyrus), it would be wise to scope updates down to minor releases (e.g., 1.5._, 2.0._) to make sure that you don't jump up to a new major version (e.g., 1._, 2._) without knowing it (whereas I'm defining version numbers as `<architecture>.<major>.<minor>`, like the Linux kernel, Mac OS X, and Firefox releases before 4.0).\n\nMake sense? :)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/10178857/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/comments/10208466", "html_url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/5#issuecomment-10208466", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/5", "id": 10208466, "user": {"login": "ashishtilara", "id": 1509613, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1509613?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara", "html_url": "https://github.com/ashishtilara", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ashishtilara/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2012-11-08T22:47:32Z", "updated_at": "2012-11-08T22:47:32Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "@skyzyx Pardon my frustration, but this doesn't really answer my concerns.

I have the following in my PHP script:\n\n``` php\n$bucket = (string) $container['misc_config']->images->amazon->bucket;\n$options = array(\n    'acl' => CannedAcl::PUBLIC_READ,\n    'Content-Type' => 'audio/mpeg',\n    'key' => 'audio/a-test-podcast.mp3',\n    'success_action_redirect' => (string) $container['misc_config']->main->base_url .

In my `$options` array, I now have:\n\n``` php\n$options = array(\n    'acl' => CannedAcl::PUBLIC_READ,\n    'Content-Type' => 'audio/mpeg',\n    'key' => 'audio/a-test-podcast.mp3',\n    'success_action_redirect' => (string) $container['misc_config']->main->base_url . 'upload/success/',\n    'success_action_status' => 201,\n    'filename' => '^'\n);\n```\n\nDon\u2019t ask my have I managed to arrive at this solution, since it\u2019s not documented anywhere I don\u2019t think!\n\nAlthough I am now faced with yet another issue. When using a Flash-based uploaded, how can I actually redirect on successful upload? My JavaScript function to instantiate Uploadify looks like this:\n\n``` js\n$('#file_upload').uploadify({\n    'buttonClass': 'button',\n    'buttonText': 'Upload',\n    'formData': <?php echo json_encode($formInputs); ?>,\n    'fileObjName': 'file',\n    'fileTypeExts': '*.mp3',\n    'height': 36,\n    'multi': false,\n    'onUploadError': function(file, errorCode, errorMsg, errorString) {\n        console.log('onUploadError', file, errorCode, errorMsg, errorString);\n    },\n    'onUploadSuccess': function(file, data, response) {\n        console.log('onUploadSuccess', file, data, response);\n    },\n    'swf': '/assets/site/swf/uploadify.swf',\n    'uploader': '<?php echo $uploadPath; ?>',\n    'width': 120\n});\n```\n\nThe content of my success page is logged in the console as the `data` argument, but I\u2019d like to actually _redirect_ to that page, rather than having the response available to me in JavaScript. Is this an issue with Flash, JavaScript, Uploadify, what?\n\nFinally, how can I enforce that only files with an **.mp3** extension are uploaded?\n", "reactions": {"url":
