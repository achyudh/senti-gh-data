"body": "Won\u2019t this problem just go away once Mvc.Razor fills out a bit?  Code in that assembly should be responsible for configuring the services provided in the default case.\n\nFrom: Ryan Nowak [mailto:notifications@github.com]\nSent: Monday, February 3, 2014 18:41\nTo: aspnet/DependencyInjection\nSubject: [DependencyInjection] Magic Service discovery (#1)\n\nRight now we have a bunch of services in mvc that don't live in mvc assembly - they live in assemblies that depend on mvc. The problem with this is that in the absence of a clever solution you need code like the following, and right now there's no place to put this code but in the user's project (which references both MVC and MVC.Razor)\n\n```\n        serviceProvider.AddInstance<IFileSystem>(new PhysicalFileSystem(appRoot));\n\n        serviceProvider.Add<IVirtualFileSystem, VirtualFileSystem>();\n\n        serviceProvider.AddInstance<IMvcRazorHost>(new MvcRazorHost(\"Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.Razor.RazorView<dynamic>\"));\n\n        serviceProvider.Add<ICompilationService, CscBasedCompilationService>();\n\n        serviceProvider.Add<IRazorCompilationService, RazorCompilationService>();\n\n        serviceProvider.Add<IVirtualPathViewFactory, VirtualPathViewFactory>();\n\n        serviceProvider.Add<IViewEngine, RazorViewEngine>();\n```\n\nThe alternative is some kind of configuration system, which means more required boilerplate (think views/web.config). So I'm spitballing a solution to spark discussion. All of the above code would be replaced with lines like this (inside mvc):\n\nvar services = new MvcServices();\n\nservices.DiscoverDefaults();\n\nGiven this kind of solution, I think a few restrictions probably apply:\n1. The assembly that provides a default service should be the one that defines the service type. This intentionally limits the set of possible error cases. Any condition where multiple assemblies attempt to default the same service would be really bad for the app developer.\n1. ```\n    We should think carefully about whether or not it's meaningful to allow 'override' with attributes as well. Right now it seems bad to allow overrides from attributes because of the same problem with multiples.\n   ```\n2. ```\n    These issues could potentially be solved with a 'resolve service' delegate of some kind, but that seems kludgy. At that point why not write your own code that put the service you want in the container.\n   ```\n\n---\n\nYou can merge this Pull Request by running\n\n  git pull
