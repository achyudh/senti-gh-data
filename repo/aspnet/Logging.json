interface. Here is the full scenario I'm seeking support for.\r\n\r\nI have an ILogger implementation for AppInsights's TelemetryClient. The ILogger.Log<TState> method implementation calls into the TrackTrace method of the underlying TelemetryClient instance. **Beside that, I also want to have a mechanism to expose the telemetryClient.LogMetric API**.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to change the ILoggerFactory.CreateLogger(string categoryName) method to be generic, maybe like the below one:\r\n    **`T CreateLogger<T>(string categoryName) where T : ILogger;`**\r\n\r\nI understand this would require some internal changes in the LoggerFactory class, but this would enable custom interface based telemetry support. In other words, I would be able to define a new interface:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public interface IExtendedLogger : ILogger\r\n    {\r\n        void LogMetric(string metricName, double value);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nand get an instance for that still using the ILoggerFactory as usual.\r\nThe TelemetryClient wrapping logger would then implement this interface instead, and would allow me to properly expose both LogMetric and Log methods.\r\n\r\nSo the classes using ILogger, which need to also be able to use the new API will need to be updated to use IExtendedLogger instead. But with that only change (on the consumer/client side) my existing logging code would just work as is, plus I would be able to also use the new LogMetric API wherever I need to.\r\n\r\nAnyway, bringing this up for discussion - would be glad to hear your feedback on this.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aspnet/Logging/issues/728/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aspnet/Logging/issues/727", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aspnet/Logging", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aspnet/Logging/issues/727/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aspnet/Logging/issues/727/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aspnet/Logging/issues/727/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aspnet/Logging/issues/727", "id": 269678372, "number": 727, "title": "CreateLogger<T>() design change proposal", "user": {"login": "squaredinfinity", "id": 1979832, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1979832?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/squaredinfinity", "html_url": "https://github.com/squaredinfinity", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/squaredinfinity/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/squaredinfinity/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/squaredinfinity/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/squaredinfinity/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/squaredinfinity/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/squaredinfinity/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/squaredinfinity/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/squaredinfinity/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/squaredinfinity/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aspnet/Logging/milestones/17", "html_url": "https://github.com/aspnet/Logging/milestone/17", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aspnet/Logging/milestones/17/labels", "id": 1409900, "number": 17, "title": "Discussions", "description": null, "creator": {"login": "muratg", "id": 1808428, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1808428?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/muratg", "html_url": "https://github.com/muratg", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/muratg/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/muratg/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/muratg/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/muratg/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/muratg/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/muratg/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/muratg/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/muratg/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/muratg/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 25, "closed_issues": 27, "state": "open", "created_at": "2015-11-13T07:03:42Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-12T21:23:49Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": null}, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2017-10-30T17:04:56Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-12T18:51:05Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nCurrently I can create a logger for a type using .CreateLogger<T>() extensions method.\r\nThis method calls .CreateLogger(Type) of the ILoggerFactory and wraps the result in Logger\\<T>().\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/Logging/blob/42ba2626b1a9e6327a43318e5888ed406e3f90da/src/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions/LoggerFactoryExtensions.cs#L25\r\n\r\nThis wrapper (Logger\\<T>) essentially makes it impossible to access wrapped logger directly, which from the end user is fine, but makes writing custom LoggerFactory/Logger bit harder for certain scenarios.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to change this slightly and, for example, introduce IGenericLoggerFactory with .CreateLogger\\<T>() method?

However, my last company had a couple nice features in our logging library that I would see as beneficial to this library as well.\r\n\r\n* `BeginContext` would be similar to `BeginScope` but would take a key and a potentially formattable value. This value would be carried though to each log message within the scope of the context `IDisposable`. This would avoid passing certain things around in the code. This is similar to #717  For instance:\r\n\r\nWithout `BeginContext`:\r\n```\r\nGuid correlationId = ...\r\nusing (logger.BeginScope(\"Process started {correlationId}\", correlationId))\r\n{\r\n    MyMethodThatTracesLotsOfThings(correlationId, ...);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid MyMethodThatTracesLotsOfThings(Guid correlationId, ...)\r\n{\r\n    logger.LogInformation(\"We did something here with {correlationId}\", correlationId); \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith `BeginContext`\r\n```\r\nGuid correlationId = ...\r\nusing (logger.BeginContext(\"correlationId\", correlationId)\r\nusing (logger.BeginScope(\"Process started\"))\r\n{\r\n    MyMethodThatTracesLotsOfThings(...);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid MyMethodThatTracesLotsOfThings(...)\r\n{\r\n    logger.LogInformation(\"We did something here\"); \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe logger can use this for the tracing at will. `BeginScope` adds some of this facility, but is really tied to a single message.\r\n\r\n* `TraceLevel.Always`. This would potentially be a breaking change with `TraceLevel`, but I sometimes want to unconditionally trace something. I know the logger implementations can still reject it, but I want to try from my application code to trace. `TraceLevel.None` should be `Int32.MinValue` and `TraceLevel.Always` should be `Int32.MaxValue`. \r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aspnet/Logging/issues/726/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,

replacement\r\nhttp://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System/services/monitoring/system/diagnosticts/EventLog.cs#1432\r\n```\r\n        [ComVisible(false)]\r\n        public void WriteEvent(EventInstance instance, byte[] data, params Object[] values) {\r\n            m_underlyingEventLog.WriteEvent(instance, data, values);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote this issue has not been a problem with ASP.NET Core 1.x, but since 2.0 EF Core starts logging message with IDs like 2005000 for `The LINQ expression 'First()' could not be translated and will be evaluated locally.`\r\n\r\nSo this is pretty critical for anyone using 2.0", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aspnet/Logging/issues/703/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh":
