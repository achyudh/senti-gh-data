"MEMBER", "body": "To make the Docker Secrets config provider more flexible, we should allow the user to specify a prefix to be removed when converting Docker Secret names to Config keys.\r\n\r\nThis makes it easier to use secrets for multiple services, for example, you may have a secret named `backend.foo` which you want to appear as `foo` in the config system. This remapping can be achieved with docker configuration, but it's good to allow flexibility here.\r\n\r\nAlso, when rolling secrets in Docker Swarm, you may want to have a prefix representing the \"version\" of the secrets, which is updated by an Environment Variable. That allows two secrets with the same \"name\" to be present during a rolling upgrade, but ensure that the correct one is loaded in to the app. For example, you may have `v1.foo` and `v2.foo` secrets and a `SECRET_PREFIX=v1` environment variable (which you update to `SECRET_PREFIX=v2`, when adding `v2.*` secrets)\r\n\r\nProposed new APIs:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class DockerSecretsConfigurationSource\r\n{\r\n    // ...\r\n    // add the following:\r\n    public string SecretPrefix { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static class DockerSecretsConfigurationBuilderExtensions\r\n{\r\n    // ...\r\n    // add the following overloads\r\n    public static IConfigurationBuilder AddDockerSecrets(this IConfigurationBuilder builder, string secretsPath, bool optional, string secretPrefix);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: I'd kinda like to be able to have `AddDockerSecrets(string secretPrefix)`, but we already have `AddDockerSecrets(string secretsPath)`. The latter seems much less commonly used, but it's there in 2.0 so it'd be a breaking change :(\r\n\r\n/cc @glennc ", "reactions": {"url":

have to ignore all comments when parsing, I think I've seen this somewhere before. Another option might be to effectively use a YAML parser but stick to the JSON subset with YAML comments. Another might be to just use the comments that JSON.NET can support. Really all we are talking about is some default config sources, and this one is parsed by JSON.NET and supports everything it does.\n", "created_at": "2014-01-30T17:53:41Z", "updated_at":
