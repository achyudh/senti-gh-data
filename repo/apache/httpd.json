could be `APLOG_ERR` (as in Debian package), or at least `APLOG_NOTICE` / \r\n`APLOG_WARNING`.\r\n\r\nWe would then easily have these messages in the error log, without having to set `LogLevel` to `debug`.\r\nGoal is then to ban (with fail2ban) hosts generating too frequently these messages. For example, a **slowloris** attacker will generate such messages.\r\n\r\nThank you very much \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\nBen", "created_at": "2017-02-09T15:56:05Z", "updated_at": "2017-02-10T11:31:40Z",

It does not protect anyone's privacy unless the recipients believe it was set by a real human being, with a real preference for privacy over personalization.\n\nMicrosoft deliberately violates the standard.  They made a big deal about announcing that very fact.  Microsoft are members of the Tracking Protection working group and are fully informed of these facts.  They are fully capable of requesting a change to the standard, but have chosen not to do so.  The decision to set DNT by default in IE10 has nothing to do with the user's privacy.

You can figure out why they want that. If you have a problem with it, choose a better browser.\n\nApache has a history of stepping in when vendors abuse HTTP.

could be `APLOG_ERR` (as in Debian package), or at least `APLOG_NOTICE` / \r\n`APLOG_WARNING`.\r\n\r\nWe would then easily have these messages in the error log, without having to set `LogLevel` to `debug`.\r\nGoal is then to ban (with fail2ban) hosts generating too frequently these messages. For example, a **slowloris** attacker will generate such messages.\r\n\r\nThank you very much \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\nBen", "created_at": "2017-02-09T15:56:05Z", "updated_at": "2017-02-10T11:31:40Z",

It does not protect anyone's privacy unless the recipients believe it was set by a real human being, with a real preference for privacy over personalization.\n\nMicrosoft deliberately violates the standard.  They made a big deal about announcing that very fact.  Microsoft are members of the Tracking Protection working group and are fully informed of these facts.  They are fully capable of requesting a change to the standard, but have chosen not to do so.  The decision to set DNT by default in IE10 has nothing to do with the user's privacy.

You can figure out why they want that. If you have a problem with it, choose a better browser.\n\nApache has a history of stepping in when vendors abuse HTTP.

could be `APLOG_ERR` (as in Debian package), or at least `APLOG_NOTICE` / \r\n`APLOG_WARNING`.\r\n\r\nWe would then easily have these messages in the error log, without having to set `LogLevel` to `debug`.\r\nGoal is then to ban (with fail2ban) hosts generating too frequently these messages. For example, a **slowloris** attacker will generate such messages.\r\n\r\nThank you very much \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\nBen", "created_at": "2017-02-09T15:56:05Z", "updated_at": "2017-02-10T11:31:40Z",

It does not protect anyone's privacy unless the recipients believe it was set by a real human being, with a real preference for privacy over personalization.\n\nMicrosoft deliberately violates the standard.  They made a big deal about announcing that very fact.  Microsoft are members of the Tracking Protection working group and are fully informed of these facts.  They are fully capable of requesting a change to the standard, but have chosen not to do so.  The decision to set DNT by default in IE10 has nothing to do with the user's privacy.

You can figure out why they want that. If you have a problem with it, choose a better browser.\n\nApache has a history of stepping in when vendors abuse HTTP.

could be `APLOG_ERR` (as in Debian package), or at least `APLOG_NOTICE` / \r\n`APLOG_WARNING`.\r\n\r\nWe would then easily have these messages in the error log, without having to set `LogLevel` to `debug`.\r\nGoal is then to ban (with fail2ban) hosts generating too frequently these messages. For example, a **slowloris** attacker will generate such messages.\r\n\r\nThank you very much \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\nBen", "created_at": "2017-02-09T15:56:05Z", "updated_at": "2017-02-10T11:31:40Z",

It does not protect anyone's privacy unless the recipients believe it was set by a real human being, with a real preference for privacy over personalization.\n\nMicrosoft deliberately violates the standard.  They made a big deal about announcing that very fact.  Microsoft are members of the Tracking Protection working group and are fully informed of these facts.  They are fully capable of requesting a change to the standard, but have chosen not to do so.  The decision to set DNT by default in IE10 has nothing to do with the user's privacy.

You can figure out why they want that. If you have a problem with it, choose a better browser.\n\nApache has a history of stepping in when vendors abuse HTTP.
