behavior has been factored out to a reparse_point?\r\n   method responsible for only validating the file attribute contains\r\n   the reparse attribute.\r\n\r\n - This introduces some additional work once a path is determined as a\r\n   reparse point, but this should not happen regularly as reparse\r\n   points are typically fairly rare on Windows systems.\r\n\r\n - Change the behavior of exist? to function similarly to symlink? in that\r\n   only understandable symlinks will be followed. exist? will return true\r\n   for reparse points that are not mount or symlink reparse points",

properly\r\n   on OSX 10.11:\r\n\r\n   * When performing a `gem install bundler`, system Ruby places the\r\n     binstub in /usr/local/bin. However, the SSH environment is not\r\n     configured with /usr/local/bin in PATH. There are multiple\r\n     solutions to this problem:\r\n\r\n      - Add /usr/local/bin to ~/.ssh/environment in Beaker - covered\r\n        in BKR-1139. This allows any additional binaries that might\r\n        be installed (homebrew, git, other Ruby gems with binstubs\r\n        such as puppet and facter) to be available. This is the most\r\n        effective universal solution but requires a Beaker release.\r\n\r\n        A workaround is in place to do this in 000_EnvSetup of the\r\n        pre-suite until Beaker changes land.\r\n\r\n      - Add to the host[:host_env] hash of environment variables via\r\n        a Beaker options file, so that PATH is augmented with\r\n        /usr/local/bin. Unfortunately this requires setting additional\r\n        hosts / options files on disk prior to any code running in\r\n        the Puppet pre-suite, to be picked up during Beakers host\r\n        initialization and injected into ~/.ssh/environment correctly.\r\n        Otherwise, the PATH would have to be manipulated in each new\r\n        SSH command. Due to beaker-hostgenerator commonly being used\r\n        to execute, its simpler to avoid this option.\r\n\r\n        Note that beaker-hostgenerator should also allow arbitrary\r\n        settings injection using {} syntax, but this doesn't appear to\r\n        work properly with ci:test:git and it's uncertain if it\r\n        properly handles the :host_env hash when writing to YAML.\r\n\r\n   * When performing `bundle install`, ensure Ruby is configured to\r\n     use OSX platform specific gems where possible. This impacts\r\n     the inclusion of CFPropertyList.\r\n\r\n   * Due to OSX SIP (System Integrity Protection) /usr/bin is not\r\n     writable and /usr/local/bin should be used instead. Override\r\n     Beakers default puppetbindir setting to /usr/local/bin and use\r\n     that as the --binstub directory when installing the Puppet source\r\n     with Bundler. binstubs should continue to use /usr/bin/ruby as\r\n     the interpreter.\r\n\r\n   * Similarly, when calling install.rb, provide --bindir as the same\r\n     /usr/local/bin as the system Ruby binstub dir is not otherwise\r\n     writable. Beaker helpers will fully qualify the path to puppet\r\n     using the puppetbindir setting already.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/issues/5971/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/issues/5855", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/issues/5855/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/issues/5855/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/issues/5855/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/5855", "id": 227878908, "number": 5855, "title": "(PUP-7519) Enabling rubocop securitycop scans", "user": {"login": "jsane", "id": 25072698, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25072698?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane", "html_url": "https://github.com/jsane", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 183279739, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/labels/Blocked", "name": "Blocked", "color": "e11d21", "default": false}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 7, "created_at": "2017-05-11T05:03:34Z", "updated_at": "2017-08-31T15:32:11Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/pulls/5855", "html_url": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/5855", "diff_url": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/5855.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/5855.patch"}, "body": "Background: Rubocop scans were not running as the various cops in .rubocop.yml were not kept uptodate with the latest definitions.

SSLSocket#accept once\n\nPreviously, our webrick code set the webrick option SSLStartImmediately to true\nand then called `SSLServer#start_immediately = false`, in that order. Ruby\nversions 2.3.6/2.4.3 and up will skip the call to SSLSocket#accept if the\nSSLStartImmediately option is false. However, older versions will skip the call\nif the SSLServer `@start_immediately` instance variable is false[1].\n\nPrior to commit a358d5ec0, newer ruby versions caused an error because\nSSLSocket#accept was called twice on the same socket, once by webrick and again\nby us.\n\nCommit a358d5ec0 fixed the newer ruby case, but regressed on the older ruby\ncase, since SSLSocket#accept was never being called.\n\nThis commit eliminates the call to `start_immediately = false`, and sets the\nconfiguration option to false. This works as far back as ruby 1.9.3, while\npreserving the intent of the original issue[2].\n\nPaired-with: Jacob Helwig <jacob@puppet.com>\n\n[1] https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/2e728d51e70\n[1]

may\r\n   not actually resolve to a different path):\r\n\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_HSM\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_HSM2\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_SIS\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_WIM\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_CSV\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DFS\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DFSR\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DEDUP\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_NFS\r\n\r\n - Modify the behavior of symlink? such that Puppet only considers\r\n   reparse points IO_REPARSE_TAG_MOUNT_POINT, IO_REPARSE_TAG_SYMLINK\r\n   as resolvable symlinks.\r\n\r\n   The others will continue to be treated as regular files /\r\n   directories.\r\n\r\n - Existing symlink? behavior has been factored out to a reparse_point?\r\n   method responsible for only validating the file attribute contains\r\n   the reparse attribute.\r\n\r\n - This introduces some additional work once a path is determined as a\r\n   reparse point, but this should not happen regularly as reparse\r\n   points are typically fairly rare on Windows systems.\r\n\r\n - Change the behavior of exist? to function similarly to symlink? in that\r\n   only understandable symlinks will be followed. exist? will return true\r\n   for reparse points that are not mount or symlink reparse points",

problems prevented ci:test:git from executing properly\r\n   on OSX 10.11:\r\n\r\n   * When performing a `gem install bundler`, system Ruby places the\r\n     binstub in /usr/local/bin. However, the SSH environment is not\r\n     configured with /usr/local/bin in PATH. There are multiple\r\n     solutions to this problem:\r\n\r\n      - Add /usr/local/bin to ~/.ssh/environment in Beaker - covered\r\n        in BKR-1139. This allows any additional binaries that might\r\n        be installed (homebrew, git, other Ruby gems with binstubs\r\n        such as puppet and facter) to be available. This is the most\r\n        effective universal solution but requires a Beaker release.\r\n\r\n        A workaround is in place to do this in 000_EnvSetup of the\r\n        pre-suite until Beaker changes land.\r\n\r\n      - Add to the host[:host_env] hash of environment variables via\r\n        a Beaker options file, so that PATH is augmented with\r\n        /usr/local/bin. Unfortunately this requires setting additional\r\n        hosts / options files on disk prior to any code running in\r\n        the Puppet pre-suite, to be picked up during Beakers host\r\n        initialization and injected into ~/.ssh/environment correctly.\r\n        Otherwise, the PATH would have to be manipulated in each new\r\n        SSH command. Due to beaker-hostgenerator commonly being used\r\n        to execute, its simpler to avoid this option.\r\n\r\n        Note that beaker-hostgenerator should also allow arbitrary\r\n        settings injection using {} syntax, but this doesn't appear to\r\n        work properly with ci:test:git and it's uncertain if it\r\n        properly handles the :host_env hash when writing to YAML.\r\n\r\n   * When performing `bundle install`, ensure Ruby is configured to\r\n     use OSX platform specific gems where possible. This impacts\r\n     the inclusion of CFPropertyList.\r\n\r\n   * Due to OSX SIP (System Integrity Protection) /usr/bin is not\r\n     writable and /usr/local/bin should be used instead. Override\r\n     Beakers default puppetbindir setting to /usr/local/bin and use\r\n     that as the --binstub directory when installing the Puppet source\r\n     with Bundler. binstubs should continue to use /usr/bin/ruby as\r\n     the interpreter.\r\n\r\n   * Similarly, when calling install.rb, provide --bindir as the same\r\n     /usr/local/bin as the system Ruby binstub dir is not otherwise\r\n     writable. Beaker helpers will fully qualify the path to puppet\r\n     using the puppetbindir setting already.", "created_at": "2017-06-11T00:52:47Z", "updated_at": "2017-09-15T17:06:28Z", "closed_at": null,

This is relevant specifically to file resources.\r\n\r\n   However, Puppet cannot resolve the destination location for many of\r\n   the reparse point types, namely the following (some of which may\r\n   not actually resolve to a different path):\r\n\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_HSM\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_HSM2\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_SIS\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_WIM\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_CSV\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DFS\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DFSR\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DEDUP\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_NFS\r\n\r\n - Modify the behavior of symlink? such that Puppet only considers\r\n   reparse points IO_REPARSE_TAG_MOUNT_POINT, IO_REPARSE_TAG_SYMLINK\r\n   as resolvable symlinks.\r\n\r\n   The others will continue to be treated as regular files /\r\n   directories.\r\n\r\n - Existing symlink? behavior has been factored out to a reparse_point?\r\n   method responsible for only validating the file attribute contains\r\n   the reparse attribute.\r\n\r\n - This introduces some additional work once a path is determined as a\r\n   reparse point, but this should not happen regularly as reparse\r\n   points are typically fairly rare on Windows systems.\r\n\r\n - Change the behavior of exist? to function similarly to symlink? in that\r\n   only understandable symlinks will be followed. exist? will return true\r\n   for reparse points that are not mount or symlink reparse points",

properly\r\n   on OSX 10.11:\r\n\r\n   * When performing a `gem install bundler`, system Ruby places the\r\n     binstub in /usr/local/bin. However, the SSH environment is not\r\n     configured with /usr/local/bin in PATH. There are multiple\r\n     solutions to this problem:\r\n\r\n      - Add /usr/local/bin to ~/.ssh/environment in Beaker - covered\r\n        in BKR-1139. This allows any additional binaries that might\r\n        be installed (homebrew, git, other Ruby gems with binstubs\r\n        such as puppet and facter) to be available. This is the most\r\n        effective universal solution but requires a Beaker release.\r\n\r\n        A workaround is in place to do this in 000_EnvSetup of the\r\n        pre-suite until Beaker changes land.\r\n\r\n      - Add to the host[:host_env] hash of environment variables via\r\n        a Beaker options file, so that PATH is augmented with\r\n        /usr/local/bin. Unfortunately this requires setting additional\r\n        hosts / options files on disk prior to any code running in\r\n        the Puppet pre-suite, to be picked up during Beakers host\r\n        initialization and injected into ~/.ssh/environment correctly.\r\n        Otherwise, the PATH would have to be manipulated in each new\r\n        SSH command. Due to beaker-hostgenerator commonly being used\r\n        to execute, its simpler to avoid this option.\r\n\r\n        Note that beaker-hostgenerator should also allow arbitrary\r\n        settings injection using {} syntax, but this doesn't appear to\r\n        work properly with ci:test:git and it's uncertain if it\r\n        properly handles the :host_env hash when writing to YAML.\r\n\r\n   * When performing `bundle install`, ensure Ruby is configured to\r\n     use OSX platform specific gems where possible. This impacts\r\n     the inclusion of CFPropertyList.\r\n\r\n   * Due to OSX SIP (System Integrity Protection) /usr/bin is not\r\n     writable and /usr/local/bin should be used instead. Override\r\n     Beakers default puppetbindir setting to /usr/local/bin and use\r\n     that as the --binstub directory when installing the Puppet source\r\n     with Bundler. binstubs should continue to use /usr/bin/ruby as\r\n     the interpreter.\r\n\r\n   * Similarly, when calling install.rb, provide --bindir as the same\r\n     /usr/local/bin as the system Ruby binstub dir is not otherwise\r\n     writable. Beaker helpers will fully qualify the path to puppet\r\n     using the puppetbindir setting already.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/issues/5971/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/issues/5855", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/issues/5855/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/issues/5855/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/issues/5855/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/5855", "id": 227878908, "number": 5855, "title": "(PUP-7519) Enabling rubocop securitycop scans", "user": {"login": "jsane", "id": 25072698, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25072698?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane", "html_url": "https://github.com/jsane", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 183279739, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/labels/Blocked", "name": "Blocked", "color": "e11d21", "default": false}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 7, "created_at": "2017-05-11T05:03:34Z", "updated_at": "2017-08-31T15:32:11Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/pulls/5855", "html_url": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/5855", "diff_url": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/5855.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/5855.patch"}, "body": "Background: Rubocop scans were not running as the various cops in .rubocop.yml were not kept uptodate with the latest definitions.

SSLSocket#accept once\n\nPreviously, our webrick code set the webrick option SSLStartImmediately to true\nand then called `SSLServer#start_immediately = false`, in that order. Ruby\nversions 2.3.6/2.4.3 and up will skip the call to SSLSocket#accept if the\nSSLStartImmediately option is false. However, older versions will skip the call\nif the SSLServer `@start_immediately` instance variable is false[1].\n\nPrior to commit a358d5ec0, newer ruby versions caused an error because\nSSLSocket#accept was called twice on the same socket, once by webrick and again\nby us.\n\nCommit a358d5ec0 fixed the newer ruby case, but regressed on the older ruby\ncase, since SSLSocket#accept was never being called.\n\nThis commit eliminates the call to `start_immediately = false`, and sets the\nconfiguration option to false. This works as far back as ruby 1.9.3, while\npreserving the intent of the original issue[2].\n\nPaired-with: Jacob Helwig <jacob@puppet.com>\n\n[1] https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/2e728d51e70\n[1]

may\r\n   not actually resolve to a different path):\r\n\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_HSM\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_HSM2\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_SIS\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_WIM\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_CSV\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DFS\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DFSR\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DEDUP\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_NFS\r\n\r\n - Modify the behavior of symlink? such that Puppet only considers\r\n   reparse points IO_REPARSE_TAG_MOUNT_POINT, IO_REPARSE_TAG_SYMLINK\r\n   as resolvable symlinks.\r\n\r\n   The others will continue to be treated as regular files /\r\n   directories.\r\n\r\n - Existing symlink? behavior has been factored out to a reparse_point?\r\n   method responsible for only validating the file attribute contains\r\n   the reparse attribute.\r\n\r\n - This introduces some additional work once a path is determined as a\r\n   reparse point, but this should not happen regularly as reparse\r\n   points are typically fairly rare on Windows systems.\r\n\r\n - Change the behavior of exist? to function similarly to symlink? in that\r\n   only understandable symlinks will be followed. exist? will return true\r\n   for reparse points that are not mount or symlink reparse points",

problems prevented ci:test:git from executing properly\r\n   on OSX 10.11:\r\n\r\n   * When performing a `gem install bundler`, system Ruby places the\r\n     binstub in /usr/local/bin. However, the SSH environment is not\r\n     configured with /usr/local/bin in PATH. There are multiple\r\n     solutions to this problem:\r\n\r\n      - Add /usr/local/bin to ~/.ssh/environment in Beaker - covered\r\n        in BKR-1139. This allows any additional binaries that might\r\n        be installed (homebrew, git, other Ruby gems with binstubs\r\n        such as puppet and facter) to be available. This is the most\r\n        effective universal solution but requires a Beaker release.\r\n\r\n        A workaround is in place to do this in 000_EnvSetup of the\r\n        pre-suite until Beaker changes land.\r\n\r\n      - Add to the host[:host_env] hash of environment variables via\r\n        a Beaker options file, so that PATH is augmented with\r\n        /usr/local/bin. Unfortunately this requires setting additional\r\n        hosts / options files on disk prior to any code running in\r\n        the Puppet pre-suite, to be picked up during Beakers host\r\n        initialization and injected into ~/.ssh/environment correctly.\r\n        Otherwise, the PATH would have to be manipulated in each new\r\n        SSH command. Due to beaker-hostgenerator commonly being used\r\n        to execute, its simpler to avoid this option.\r\n\r\n        Note that beaker-hostgenerator should also allow arbitrary\r\n        settings injection using {} syntax, but this doesn't appear to\r\n        work properly with ci:test:git and it's uncertain if it\r\n        properly handles the :host_env hash when writing to YAML.\r\n\r\n   * When performing `bundle install`, ensure Ruby is configured to\r\n     use OSX platform specific gems where possible. This impacts\r\n     the inclusion of CFPropertyList.\r\n\r\n   * Due to OSX SIP (System Integrity Protection) /usr/bin is not\r\n     writable and /usr/local/bin should be used instead. Override\r\n     Beakers default puppetbindir setting to /usr/local/bin and use\r\n     that as the --binstub directory when installing the Puppet source\r\n     with Bundler. binstubs should continue to use /usr/bin/ruby as\r\n     the interpreter.\r\n\r\n   * Similarly, when calling install.rb, provide --bindir as the same\r\n     /usr/local/bin as the system Ruby binstub dir is not otherwise\r\n     writable. Beaker helpers will fully qualify the path to puppet\r\n     using the puppetbindir setting already.", "created_at": "2017-06-11T00:52:47Z", "updated_at": "2017-09-15T17:06:28Z", "closed_at": null,

This is relevant specifically to file resources.\r\n\r\n   However, Puppet cannot resolve the destination location for many of\r\n   the reparse point types, namely the following (some of which may\r\n   not actually resolve to a different path):\r\n\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_HSM\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_HSM2\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_SIS\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_WIM\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_CSV\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DFS\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DFSR\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DEDUP\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_NFS\r\n\r\n - Modify the behavior of symlink? such that Puppet only considers\r\n   reparse points IO_REPARSE_TAG_MOUNT_POINT, IO_REPARSE_TAG_SYMLINK\r\n   as resolvable symlinks.\r\n\r\n   The others will continue to be treated as regular files /\r\n   directories.\r\n\r\n - Existing symlink? behavior has been factored out to a reparse_point?\r\n   method responsible for only validating the file attribute contains\r\n   the reparse attribute.\r\n\r\n - This introduces some additional work once a path is determined as a\r\n   reparse point, but this should not happen regularly as reparse\r\n   points are typically fairly rare on Windows systems.\r\n\r\n - Change the behavior of exist? to function similarly to symlink? in that\r\n   only understandable symlinks will be followed. exist? will return true\r\n   for reparse points that are not mount or symlink reparse points",

properly\r\n   on OSX 10.11:\r\n\r\n   * When performing a `gem install bundler`, system Ruby places the\r\n     binstub in /usr/local/bin. However, the SSH environment is not\r\n     configured with /usr/local/bin in PATH. There are multiple\r\n     solutions to this problem:\r\n\r\n      - Add /usr/local/bin to ~/.ssh/environment in Beaker - covered\r\n        in BKR-1139. This allows any additional binaries that might\r\n        be installed (homebrew, git, other Ruby gems with binstubs\r\n        such as puppet and facter) to be available. This is the most\r\n        effective universal solution but requires a Beaker release.\r\n\r\n        A workaround is in place to do this in 000_EnvSetup of the\r\n        pre-suite until Beaker changes land.\r\n\r\n      - Add to the host[:host_env] hash of environment variables via\r\n        a Beaker options file, so that PATH is augmented with\r\n        /usr/local/bin. Unfortunately this requires setting additional\r\n        hosts / options files on disk prior to any code running in\r\n        the Puppet pre-suite, to be picked up during Beakers host\r\n        initialization and injected into ~/.ssh/environment correctly.\r\n        Otherwise, the PATH would have to be manipulated in each new\r\n        SSH command. Due to beaker-hostgenerator commonly being used\r\n        to execute, its simpler to avoid this option.\r\n\r\n        Note that beaker-hostgenerator should also allow arbitrary\r\n        settings injection using {} syntax, but this doesn't appear to\r\n        work properly with ci:test:git and it's uncertain if it\r\n        properly handles the :host_env hash when writing to YAML.\r\n\r\n   * When performing `bundle install`, ensure Ruby is configured to\r\n     use OSX platform specific gems where possible.

SSLSocket#accept once\n\nPreviously, our webrick code set the webrick option SSLStartImmediately to true\nand then called `SSLServer#start_immediately = false`, in that order. Ruby\nversions 2.3.6/2.4.3 and up will skip the call to SSLSocket#accept if the\nSSLStartImmediately option is false. However, older versions will skip the call\nif the SSLServer `@start_immediately` instance variable is false[1].\n\nPrior to commit a358d5ec0, newer ruby versions caused an error because\nSSLSocket#accept was called twice on the same socket, once by webrick and again\nby us.\n\nCommit a358d5ec0 fixed the newer ruby case, but regressed on the older ruby\ncase, since SSLSocket#accept was never being called.\n\nThis commit eliminates the call to `start_immediately = false`, and sets the\nconfiguration option to false. This works as far back as ruby 1.9.3, while\npreserving the intent of the original issue[2].\n\nPaired-with: Jacob Helwig <jacob@puppet.com>\n\n[1] https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/2e728d51e70\n[1]

Nor does this commit\r\nattempt to update the puppetserver nightly install. Nightlies is going\r\nto change soon, so it is not worth updating those methods currently.\r\n\r\nThis commit also updates beaker and beaker-hostgenerator versions.

any file that returned FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT\r\n   in a call to GetFileAttributes would be considered a \"symlink\" for\r\n   Puppets purpose. This is relevant specifically to file resources.\r\n\r\n   However, Puppet cannot resolve the destination location for many of\r\n   the reparse point types, namely the following (some of which may\r\n   not actually resolve to a different path):\r\n\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_HSM\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_HSM2\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_SIS\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_WIM\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_CSV\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DFS\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DFSR\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DEDUP\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_NFS\r\n\r\n - Modify the behavior of symlink? such that Puppet only considers\r\n   reparse points IO_REPARSE_TAG_MOUNT_POINT, IO_REPARSE_TAG_SYMLINK\r\n   as resolvable symlinks.\r\n\r\n   The others will continue to be treated as regular files /\r\n   directories.\r\n\r\n - Existing symlink? behavior has been factored out to a reparse_point?\r\n   method responsible for only validating the file attribute contains\r\n   the reparse attribute.\r\n\r\n - This introduces some additional work once a path is determined as a\r\n   reparse point, but this should not happen regularly as reparse\r\n   points are typically fairly rare on Windows systems.\r\n\r\n - Change the behavior of exist? to function similarly to symlink? in that\r\n   only understandable symlinks will be followed. exist? will return true\r\n   for reparse points that are not mount or symlink reparse points",

These are special Sys V services beginning\r\nwith the string 'boot.'. When `chkconfig` is run against them, they print\r\n'<name>  B' instead of '<name>  on', so the existing regex does not match them.\r\nThus the redhat provider always sees them as disabled, and tries

problems prevented ci:test:git from executing properly\r\n   on OSX 10.11:\r\n\r\n   * When performing a `gem install bundler`, system Ruby places the\r\n     binstub in /usr/local/bin. However, the SSH environment is not\r\n     configured with /usr/local/bin in PATH. There are multiple\r\n     solutions to this problem:\r\n\r\n      - Add /usr/local/bin to ~/.ssh/environment in Beaker - covered\r\n        in BKR-1139. This allows any additional binaries that might\r\n        be installed (homebrew, git, other Ruby gems with binstubs\r\n        such as puppet and facter) to be available. This is the most\r\n        effective universal solution but requires a Beaker release.\r\n\r\n        A workaround is in place to do this in 000_EnvSetup of the\r\n        pre-suite until Beaker changes land.\r\n\r\n      - Add to the host[:host_env] hash of environment variables via\r\n        a Beaker options file, so that PATH is augmented with\r\n        /usr/local/bin. Unfortunately this requires setting additional\r\n        hosts / options files on disk prior to any code running in\r\n        the Puppet pre-suite, to be picked up during Beakers host\r\n        initialization and injected into ~/.ssh/environment correctly.\r\n        Otherwise, the PATH would have to be manipulated in each new\r\n        SSH command. Due to beaker-hostgenerator commonly being used\r\n        to execute, its simpler to avoid this option.\r\n\r\n        Note that beaker-hostgenerator should also allow arbitrary\r\n        settings injection using {} syntax, but this doesn't appear to\r\n        work properly with ci:test:git and it's uncertain if it\r\n        properly handles the :host_env hash when writing to YAML.\r\n\r\n   * When performing `bundle install`, ensure Ruby is configured to\r\n     use OSX platform specific gems where possible. This impacts\r\n     the inclusion of CFPropertyList.\r\n\r\n   * Due to OSX SIP (System Integrity Protection) /usr/bin is not\r\n     writable and /usr/local/bin should be used instead. Override\r\n     Beakers default puppetbindir setting to /usr/local/bin and use\r\n     that as the --binstub directory when installing the Puppet source\r\n     with Bundler. binstubs should continue to use /usr/bin/ruby as\r\n     the interpreter.\r\n\r\n   * Similarly, when calling install.rb, provide --bindir as the same\r\n     /usr/local/bin as the system Ruby binstub dir is not otherwise\r\n     writable. Beaker helpers will fully qualify the path to puppet\r\n     using the puppetbindir setting already.", "created_at": "2017-06-11T00:52:47Z", "updated_at": "2017-09-15T17:06:28Z", "closed_at": null,

properly\r\n   on OSX 10.11:\r\n\r\n   * When performing a `gem install bundler`, system Ruby places the\r\n     binstub in /usr/local/bin. However, the SSH environment is not\r\n     configured with /usr/local/bin in PATH. There are multiple\r\n     solutions to this problem:\r\n\r\n      - Add /usr/local/bin to ~/.ssh/environment in Beaker - covered\r\n        in BKR-1139. This allows any additional binaries that might\r\n        be installed (homebrew, git, other Ruby gems with binstubs\r\n        such as puppet and facter) to be available. This is the most\r\n        effective universal solution but requires a Beaker release.\r\n\r\n        A workaround is in place to do this in 000_EnvSetup of the\r\n        pre-suite until Beaker changes land.\r\n\r\n      - Add to the host[:host_env] hash of environment variables via\r\n        a Beaker options file, so that PATH is augmented with\r\n        /usr/local/bin. Unfortunately this requires setting additional\r\n        hosts / options files on disk prior to any code running in\r\n        the Puppet pre-suite, to be picked up during Beakers host\r\n        initialization and injected into ~/.ssh/environment correctly.\r\n        Otherwise, the PATH would have to be manipulated in each new\r\n        SSH command. Due to beaker-hostgenerator commonly being used\r\n        to execute, its simpler to avoid this option.\r\n\r\n        Note that beaker-hostgenerator should also allow arbitrary\r\n        settings injection using {} syntax, but this doesn't appear to\r\n        work properly with ci:test:git and it's uncertain if it\r\n        properly handles the :host_env hash when writing to YAML.\r\n\r\n   * When performing `bundle install`, ensure Ruby is configured to\r\n     use OSX platform specific gems where possible. This impacts\r\n     the inclusion of CFPropertyList.\r\n\r\n   * Due to OSX SIP (System Integrity Protection) /usr/bin is not\r\n     writable and /usr/local/bin should be used instead. Override\r\n     Beakers default puppetbindir setting to /usr/local/bin and use\r\n     that as the --binstub directory when installing the Puppet source\r\n     with Bundler. binstubs should continue to use /usr/bin/ruby as\r\n     the interpreter.\r\n\r\n   * Similarly, when calling install.rb, provide --bindir as the same\r\n     /usr/local/bin as the system Ruby binstub dir is not otherwise\r\n     writable. Beaker helpers will fully qualify the path to puppet\r\n     using the puppetbindir setting already.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/issues/5971/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/issues/5855", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/issues/5855/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/issues/5855/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/issues/5855/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/5855", "id": 227878908, "number": 5855, "title": "(PUP-7519) Enabling rubocop securitycop scans", "user": {"login": "jsane", "id": 25072698, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25072698?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane", "html_url": "https://github.com/jsane", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsane/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 183279739, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/labels/Blocked", "name": "Blocked", "color": "e11d21", "default": false}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 7, "created_at": "2017-05-11T05:03:34Z", "updated_at": "2017-08-31T15:32:11Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/pulls/5855", "html_url": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/5855", "diff_url": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/5855.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/5855.patch"}, "body": "Background: Rubocop scans were not running as the various cops in .rubocop.yml were not kept uptodate with the latest definitions.

SSLSocket#accept once\n\nPreviously, our webrick code set the webrick option SSLStartImmediately to true\nand then called `SSLServer#start_immediately = false`, in that order. Ruby\nversions 2.3.6/2.4.3 and up will skip the call to SSLSocket#accept if the\nSSLStartImmediately option is false. However, older versions will skip the call\nif the SSLServer `@start_immediately` instance variable is false[1].\n\nPrior to commit a358d5ec0, newer ruby versions caused an error because\nSSLSocket#accept was called twice on the same socket, once by webrick and again\nby us.\n\nCommit a358d5ec0 fixed the newer ruby case, but regressed on the older ruby\ncase, since SSLSocket#accept was never being called.\n\nThis commit eliminates the call to `start_immediately = false`, and sets the\nconfiguration option to false. This works as far back as ruby 1.9.3, while\npreserving the intent of the original issue[2].\n\nPaired-with: Jacob Helwig <jacob@puppet.com>\n\n[1] https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/2e728d51e70\n[1]

For example, task `foo` would match both `foo.py`\nand `foobar.py`. The desired behavior is that filenames need to match\nall the way up to the file extension, in order to be associated with a\nparticular task.\n\nThis commit changes the existing_paths method to

any file that returned FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT\r\n   in a call to GetFileAttributes would be considered a \"symlink\" for\r\n   Puppets purpose. This is relevant specifically to file resources.\r\n\r\n   However, Puppet cannot resolve the destination location for many of\r\n   the reparse point types, namely the following (some of which may\r\n   not actually resolve to a different path):\r\n\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_HSM\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_HSM2\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_SIS\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_WIM\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_CSV\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DFS\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DFSR\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_DEDUP\r\n   IO_REPARSE_TAG_NFS\r\n\r\n - Modify the behavior of symlink? such that Puppet only considers\r\n   reparse points IO_REPARSE_TAG_MOUNT_POINT, IO_REPARSE_TAG_SYMLINK\r\n   as resolvable symlinks.\r\n\r\n   The others will continue to be treated as regular files /\r\n   directories.\r\n\r\n - Existing symlink? behavior has been factored out to a reparse_point?\r\n   method responsible for only validating the file attribute contains\r\n   the reparse attribute.\r\n\r\n - This introduces some additional work once a path is determined as a\r\n   reparse point, but this should not happen regularly as reparse\r\n   points are typically fairly rare on Windows systems.\r\n\r\n - Change the behavior of exist? to function similarly to symlink? in that\r\n   only understandable symlinks will be followed. exist? will return true\r\n   for reparse points that are not mount or symlink reparse points",

problems prevented ci:test:git from executing properly\r\n   on OSX 10.11:\r\n\r\n   * When performing a `gem install bundler`, system Ruby places the\r\n     binstub in /usr/local/bin. However, the SSH environment is not\r\n     configured with /usr/local/bin in PATH. There are multiple\r\n     solutions to this problem:\r\n\r\n      - Add /usr/local/bin to ~/.ssh/environment in Beaker - covered\r\n        in BKR-1139. This allows any additional binaries that might\r\n        be installed (homebrew, git, other Ruby gems with binstubs\r\n        such as puppet and facter) to be available. This is the most\r\n        effective universal solution but requires a Beaker release.\r\n\r\n        A workaround is in place to do this in 000_EnvSetup of the\r\n        pre-suite until Beaker changes land.\r\n\r\n      - Add to the host[:host_env] hash of environment variables via\r\n        a Beaker options file, so that PATH is augmented with\r\n        /usr/local/bin. Unfortunately this requires setting additional\r\n        hosts / options files on disk prior to any code running in\r\n        the Puppet pre-suite, to be picked up during Beakers host\r\n        initialization and injected into ~/.ssh/environment correctly.\r\n        Otherwise, the PATH would have to be manipulated in each new\r\n        SSH command. Due to beaker-hostgenerator commonly being used\r\n        to execute, its simpler to avoid this option.\r\n\r\n        Note that beaker-hostgenerator should also allow arbitrary\r\n        settings injection using {} syntax, but this doesn't appear to\r\n        work properly with ci:test:git and it's uncertain if it\r\n        properly handles the :host_env hash when writing to YAML.\r\n\r\n   * When performing `bundle install`, ensure Ruby is configured to\r\n     use OSX platform specific gems where possible. This impacts\r\n     the inclusion of CFPropertyList.\r\n\r\n   * Due to OSX SIP (System Integrity Protection) /usr/bin is not\r\n     writable and /usr/local/bin should be used instead. Override\r\n     Beakers default puppetbindir setting to /usr/local/bin and use\r\n     that as the --binstub directory when installing the Puppet source\r\n     with Bundler. binstubs should continue to use /usr/bin/ruby as\r\n     the interpreter.\r\n\r\n   * Similarly, when calling install.rb, provide --bindir as the same\r\n     /usr/local/bin as the system Ruby binstub dir is not otherwise\r\n     writable. Beaker helpers will fully qualify the path to puppet\r\n     using the puppetbindir setting already.", "created_at": "2017-06-11T00:52:47Z", "updated_at": "2017-09-15T17:06:28Z", "closed_at": null,

Additional security or other cop rules can/would be added in future.   \r\nRubocop do not have support for flagging YAML.load_file which would have been desirable. Likewise it is not necessary to mark the known instance of Yaml.load_file in Puppet::Util::Yaml to be ignored.\r\n\r\nNote that there are a couple of other YAML.load instances elsewhere so this may generate violations. If that is not desired this PR be merged after all these have been resolved/changed appropriately.
