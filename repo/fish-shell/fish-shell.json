There's no way around that other than the idea that it's syntactic sugar.\r\n* *The law of user focus*: I don't know about anyone else, but I expected these operators to exist when I first used Fish. They're almost universal across other languages and shells, and they're the first thing I reached for. I realized that's a sample size of one, but I wonder if other people expect the same thing. The use of `;` also requires the user to understand that `and` is a command, which adds a bit of cognitive load.\r\n* *The law of discoverability*: When I type `&&` in a command, Fish prints out an error message telling me what I should have used `and` instead. However, I wish would just do what I wanted instead.

Printf debugging suggests that stuckness happens on `if not type -q __fish_command_not_found_handler` line, inside `__fish_disable_bracketed_paste` handler. Commenting-out `printf` inside that handler mitigates the issue.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n### Naive way in line how issue was noticed\r\n1. From cmd.exe run bash\r\n2. Verify that pid=2 via `echo $$`\r\n3. From bash run `exec fish`\r\n4. At this point fish hangs and terminal is unresponsive.\r\n5. Start another terminal emulator and perform steps 1 and 2.\r\n6. In 2nd terminal emulator you have working fish instance.\r\n7. Run `pkill fish` to kill all running fish instances. Go to step 1 to reproduce again.\r\n\r\n### Another way to reproduce proving that it is related to pid=2\r\n1. From cmd.exe run `bash`\r\n2. From another cmd.exe run `bash`\r\n3. Run `echo $$` in both terminals\r\n4. Run `exec fish` in a terminal where pid!=2, this starts fish just fine\r\n5. Run `exec fish` in a terminal where pid==2, this instance hangs\r\n\r\n4 and 5 can be reordered.\r\n\r\n## Further actions\r\nI am open to debug this further but I am not sure what to look for.\r\n\r\n## Use case\r\nThis is useful if you want to run fish as your main shell in WSL. fish can replace bash on startup via ~/.bashrc. Bash normally starts as pid=2 so as I would expect any other default shell to:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1058248/33801875-258125ac-dd61-11e7-991a-39a75bc3d799.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Possible mitigations\r\nMake it possible to disable [bracketed paste mode](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/3871#issuecomment-321034918).

I just read the Design Principles document today and that alone convinced me to switch to Fish. The switch has gone swimmingly so far -- Fish is completely living up to its \"Configurability is the root of all evil\" principle.\r\n\r\nI have run into one moderate problem. I already have a way to manage configuration state between machines (I use version controlled dotfiles, but the particulars of my solution aren't important here -- lots of other people use different ways). This makes Universal Variables a \"Law of Orthogonality\" violation for me. I'd like for my `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file to describe the entire state of Fish configuration on my machine, but now I also have to think about a second mechanism that also has its own way of storing state.\r\n\r\nThe few problems I've had so far have had to do with this issue, for instance not realizing I was setting a Universal Variables in my `config.fish` file, so when I removed it the setting still persisted. Persistent, mutable state on a machine is an easy way to create user confusion, and if we can get away without it (and the `config.fish` file already provides a great way of doing so) I think it's worth considering.\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks for Fish!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4542/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540", "id": 275014361, "number": 4540, "title": "`read | cat` crashes fish", "user": {"login": "JohnMH", "id": 2576152, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2576152?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH", "html_url": "https://github.com/JohnMH", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 4724776, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "fc2929", "default": true}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestone/18", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18/labels", "id": 2597361, "number": 18, "title": "fish-3.0", "description": "The proposed 3.0 major release of fish.

"[cmake] Untangle the CMake versioning\n\nThis untangles the CMake versioning issues (I hope) as discussed in #4626.\nNote most of the advice found on the Internet about how to inject git\nversions into CMake is just wrong.\n\nThe behavior we want is to unconditionally run the script\nbuild_tools/git_version_gen.sh at build time (i.e. when you invoke ninja or\nmake, and not when you invoke cmake, which is build system generation time).\nThis script is careful to only update the FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE if the\ncontents have changed, to avoid spurious rebuilding dependencies of\nFISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE. Assuming the git version hasn't changed, the script\nwill run, but not update FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE, and therefore\nfish_version.o will not have to be rebuilt.\n\nThis might normally rebuild more than is necessary even if the timestamp is\nnot updated, because ninja computes the dependency chain ahead of time. But\nNinja also supports the 'restat' option for just this case, and CMake is rad\nand exposes this via BYPRODUCTS. So mark FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE as a\nbyproduct and make the script always update a dummy file\n(fish-build-version-witness.txt). Note this is the use case for which\nBYPRODUCTS is designed.\n\nWe also have fish_version.cpp #include \"FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE\", and do a\nsemi-silly thing and make FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE valid C++ (so there's just\none version file).

non-external\r\nprocess (a block/builtin/function) is inside a pipeline.\r\n\r\nThis keepalive process is then made the process group leader, which\r\ntheoretically stops the process group from being coopted by PID\r\nreuse (which I'm still not sure can actually happen).\r\n\r\nBut if a non-external process is first or last in the pipeline, then\r\nfish itself needs to read/write to the terminal, so it should remain\r\npgroup leader, and therefore the keepalive process is not needed.\r\n\r\nFixes #4540.\r\n\r\n## TODOs:\r\n<!-- Just check off what what we know been done so far. We can help you with this stuff. -->\r\n- [N/A] Changes to fish usage are reflected in user documentation/manpages.\r\n- [ ] Tests have been added for regressions fixed\r\n- [ ] User-visible changes noted in CHANGELOG.md\r\n", "created_at": "2018-01-10T15:58:21Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-18T17:06:06Z", "closed_at": null, "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha": "3ec134c218b3edec4301024af08c9ab26dc0577a", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestone/18", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18/labels", "id": 2597361, "number": 18, "title": "fish-3.0", "description": "The proposed 3.0 major release of fish.

-print0` in command substitutions.\r\n\r\nWhat this does is check if a NUL is in the comsub output and then split on that instead of newline,\r\nwhich makes `something (find -print0)` just work.\r\n\r\nThe one fly in the ointment is if there is a command that uses NULs to separate its output,\r\nbut doesn't print a trailing NUL if there is just one \"thing\" to print.\r\nThat would cause us to fall back to splitting on newlines, which might do the wrong thing.\r\n\r\nSo far, everything I've tested (`find`, `git config -z`) seemed to print a trailing NUL.\r\n\r\nThis implements a proposal by @cben.\r\n\r\nFixes #3164.\r\n\r\n## TODOs:\r\n<!-- Just check off what what we know been done so far. We can help you with this stuff. -->\r\n- [ ] Changes to fish usage are reflected in user documentation/manpages.\r\n- [x] Tests have been added for regressions fixed\r\n- [ ] User-visible changes noted in CHANGELOG.md\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis does one extra `memchr` per command substitution, which is probably not significant.

This can be used in your fish_prompt\n+# function.\n+#\n+# The behavior of __fish_git_prompt is very heavily based off of the bash\n+# script's __fish_git_prompt function. As such, usage and customization is very\n+# similar, although some extra flexibility is provided in this script.\n+#\n+# The argument to __fish_git_prompt will be displayed only if you are currently\n+# in a git repository. The %s token will be the name of the branch. If HEAD is\n+# not a branch, it attempts to show the relevant tag. The tag search is\n+# controlled by the __fish_git_prompt_describe_style variable, with the\n+# following values:\n+#     default (or unset)    Any tag that exactly matches HEAD\n+#     contains              Nearest annotated tag that contains HEAD\n+#     branch                Nearest tag/branch that contains HEAD\n+#     describe              Output of `git describe`\n+#\n+# In addition, if you set __fish_git_prompt_showdirtystate to a nonempty value,\n+# unstaged (*) and staged (+) changes will be shown next to the branch name.\n+# You can configure this per-repository with the bash.showDirtyState variable,\n+# which defaults to true once __fish_git_prompt_showdirtystate is enabled. The\n+# choice to leave the variable as 'bash' instead of renaming to 'fish' is done\n+# to preserve compatibility with existing configured repositories.\n+#\n+# You can also see if currently something is stashed, by setting\n+# __fish_git_prompt_showstashstate to a nonempty value. If something is\n+# stashed, then a '$' will be shown next to the branch name.\n+#\n+# If you would like to see if there're untracked files, then you can set\n+# __fish_git_prompt_showuntrackedfiles to a nonempty value. If there're\n+# untracked files, then a '%' will be shown next to the branch name.\n+#\n+# If you would like to see the difference between HEAD and its upstream, set\n+# __fish_git_prompt_showupstream to 'auto'. A \"<\" indicates you are behind, \">\"\n+# indicates you are ahead, and \"<>\" indicates you have diverged. You can\n+# further control behavior by setting __fish_git_prompt_showupstream to a\n+# space-separated list of values:\n+#     verbose        show number of commits head/behind (+/-) upstream\n+#     legacy         don't use the '--count' option available in recent versions\n+#                    of git-rev-list\n+#     git            always compare HEAD to @{upstream}\n+#     svn            always compare HEAD to your SVN upstream\n+# By default, __fish_git_prompt will compare HEAD to your SVN upstream if it\n+# can find one, or @{upstream} otherwise.

I think that being able to wrap shell commands or fish functions with another function by enhancing the supported arguments is n important and very powerful use case.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4627/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4624", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4624/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4624/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4624/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/4624", "id": 284703568, "number": 4624, "title": "Split command substitutions on NUL if one is found", "user": {"login": "faho", "id": 5185367, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5185367?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho", "html_url": "https://github.com/faho", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 402356383, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/labels/RFC", "name": "RFC", "color": "ffefe5", "default": false}, {"id": 4724778, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/labels/enhancement", "name": "enhancement", "color": "84b6eb", "default": true}, {"id": 278051545, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/labels/release%20notes", "name": "release notes", "color": "bfdadc", "default": false}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestone/18", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18/labels", "id": 2597361, "number": 18, "title": "fish-3.0", "description": "The proposed 3.0 major release of fish.

There's no way around that other than the idea that it's syntactic sugar.\r\n* *The law of user focus*: I don't know about anyone else, but I expected these operators to exist when I first used Fish. They're almost universal across other languages and shells, and they're the first thing I reached for. I realized that's a sample size of one, but I wonder if other people expect the same thing. The use of `;` also requires the user to understand that `and` is a command, which adds a bit of cognitive load.\r\n* *The law of discoverability*: When I type `&&` in a command, Fish prints out an error message telling me what I should have used `and` instead. However, I wish would just do what I wanted instead.

Printf debugging suggests that stuckness happens on `if not type -q __fish_command_not_found_handler` line, inside `__fish_disable_bracketed_paste` handler. Commenting-out `printf` inside that handler mitigates the issue.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n### Naive way in line how issue was noticed\r\n1. From cmd.exe run bash\r\n2. Verify that pid=2 via `echo $$`\r\n3. From bash run `exec fish`\r\n4. At this point fish hangs and terminal is unresponsive.\r\n5. Start another terminal emulator and perform steps 1 and 2.\r\n6. In 2nd terminal emulator you have working fish instance.\r\n7. Run `pkill fish` to kill all running fish instances. Go to step 1 to reproduce again.\r\n\r\n### Another way to reproduce proving that it is related to pid=2\r\n1. From cmd.exe run `bash`\r\n2. From another cmd.exe run `bash`\r\n3. Run `echo $$` in both terminals\r\n4. Run `exec fish` in a terminal where pid!=2, this starts fish just fine\r\n5. Run `exec fish` in a terminal where pid==2, this instance hangs\r\n\r\n4 and 5 can be reordered.\r\n\r\n## Further actions\r\nI am open to debug this further but I am not sure what to look for.\r\n\r\n## Use case\r\nThis is useful if you want to run fish as your main shell in WSL. fish can replace bash on startup via ~/.bashrc. Bash normally starts as pid=2 so as I would expect any other default shell to:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1058248/33801875-258125ac-dd61-11e7-991a-39a75bc3d799.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Possible mitigations\r\nMake it possible to disable [bracketed paste mode](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/3871#issuecomment-321034918).

I just read the Design Principles document today and that alone convinced me to switch to Fish. The switch has gone swimmingly so far -- Fish is completely living up to its \"Configurability is the root of all evil\" principle.\r\n\r\nI have run into one moderate problem. I already have a way to manage configuration state between machines (I use version controlled dotfiles, but the particulars of my solution aren't important here -- lots of other people use different ways). This makes Universal Variables a \"Law of Orthogonality\" violation for me. I'd like for my `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file to describe the entire state of Fish configuration on my machine, but now I also have to think about a second mechanism that also has its own way of storing state.\r\n\r\nThe few problems I've had so far have had to do with this issue, for instance not realizing I was setting a Universal Variables in my `config.fish` file, so when I removed it the setting still persisted. Persistent, mutable state on a machine is an easy way to create user confusion, and if we can get away without it (and the `config.fish` file already provides a great way of doing so) I think it's worth considering.\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks for Fish!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4542/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540", "id": 275014361, "number": 4540, "title": "`read | cat` crashes fish", "user": {"login": "JohnMH", "id": 2576152, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2576152?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH", "html_url": "https://github.com/JohnMH", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 4724776, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "fc2929", "default": true}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestone/18", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18/labels", "id": 2597361, "number": 18, "title": "fish-3.0", "description": "The proposed 3.0 major release of fish.

"[cmake] Untangle the CMake versioning\n\nThis untangles the CMake versioning issues (I hope) as discussed in #4626.\nNote most of the advice found on the Internet about how to inject git\nversions into CMake is just wrong.\n\nThe behavior we want is to unconditionally run the script\nbuild_tools/git_version_gen.sh at build time (i.e. when you invoke ninja or\nmake, and not when you invoke cmake, which is build system generation time).\nThis script is careful to only update the FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE if the\ncontents have changed, to avoid spurious rebuilding dependencies of\nFISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE. Assuming the git version hasn't changed, the script\nwill run, but not update FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE, and therefore\nfish_version.o will not have to be rebuilt.\n\nThis might normally rebuild more than is necessary even if the timestamp is\nnot updated, because ninja computes the dependency chain ahead of time. But\nNinja also supports the 'restat' option for just this case, and CMake is rad\nand exposes this via BYPRODUCTS. So mark FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE as a\nbyproduct and make the script always update a dummy file\n(fish-build-version-witness.txt). Note this is the use case for which\nBYPRODUCTS is designed.\n\nWe also have fish_version.cpp #include \"FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE\", and do a\nsemi-silly thing and make FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE valid C++ (so there's just\none version file). This means we have to filter out the quotes in other\ncases..", "tree": {"sha": "5d5b0822724da4a476dedab1c5b204f78262bf16", "url":

non-external\r\nprocess (a block/builtin/function) is inside a pipeline.\r\n\r\nThis keepalive process is then made the process group leader, which\r\ntheoretically stops the process group from being coopted by PID\r\nreuse (which I'm still not sure can actually happen).\r\n\r\nBut if a non-external process is first or last in the pipeline, then\r\nfish itself needs to read/write to the terminal, so it should remain\r\npgroup leader, and therefore the keepalive process is not needed.\r\n\r\nFixes #4540.\r\n\r\n## TODOs:\r\n<!-- Just check off what what we know been done so far. We can help you with this stuff. -->\r\n- [N/A] Changes to fish usage are reflected in user documentation/manpages.\r\n- [ ] Tests have been added for regressions fixed\r\n- [ ] User-visible changes noted in CHANGELOG.md\r\n", "created_at": "2018-01-10T15:58:21Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-18T17:06:06Z", "closed_at": null, "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha": "3ec134c218b3edec4301024af08c9ab26dc0577a", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestone/18", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18/labels", "id": 2597361, "number": 18, "title": "fish-3.0", "description": "The proposed 3.0 major release of fish.

-print0` in command substitutions.\r\n\r\nWhat this does is check if a NUL is in the comsub output and then split on that instead of newline,\r\nwhich makes `something (find -print0)` just work.\r\n\r\nThe one fly in the ointment is if there is a command that uses NULs to separate its output,\r\nbut doesn't print a trailing NUL if there is just one \"thing\" to print.\r\nThat would cause us to fall back to splitting on newlines, which might do the wrong thing.\r\n\r\nSo far, everything I've tested (`find`, `git config -z`) seemed to print a trailing NUL.\r\n\r\nThis implements a proposal by @cben.\r\n\r\nFixes #3164.\r\n\r\n## TODOs:\r\n<!-- Just check off what what we know been done so far. We can help you with this stuff. -->\r\n- [ ] Changes to fish usage are reflected in user documentation/manpages.\r\n- [x] Tests have been added for regressions fixed\r\n- [ ] User-visible changes noted in CHANGELOG.md\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis does one extra `memchr` per command substitution, which is probably not significant.

This can be used in your fish_prompt\n+# function.\n+#\n+# The behavior of __fish_git_prompt is very heavily based off of the bash\n+# script's __fish_git_prompt function. As such, usage and customization is very\n+# similar, although some extra flexibility is provided in this script.\n+#\n+# The argument to __fish_git_prompt will be displayed only if you are currently\n+# in a git repository. The %s token will be the name of the branch. If HEAD is\n+# not a branch, it attempts to show the relevant tag. The tag search is\n+# controlled by the __fish_git_prompt_describe_style variable, with the\n+# following values:\n+#     default (or unset)    Any tag that exactly matches HEAD\n+#     contains              Nearest annotated tag that contains HEAD\n+#     branch                Nearest tag/branch that contains HEAD\n+#     describe              Output of `git describe`\n+#\n+# In addition, if you set __fish_git_prompt_showdirtystate to a nonempty value,\n+# unstaged (*) and staged (+) changes will be shown next to the branch name.\n+# You can configure this per-repository with the bash.showDirtyState variable,\n+# which defaults to true once __fish_git_prompt_showdirtystate is enabled. The\n+# choice to leave the variable as 'bash' instead of renaming to 'fish' is done\n+# to preserve compatibility with existing configured repositories.\n+#\n+# You can also see if currently something is stashed, by setting\n+# __fish_git_prompt_showstashstate to a nonempty value. If something is\n+# stashed, then a '$' will be shown next to the branch name.\n+#\n+# If you would like to see if there're untracked files, then you can set\n+# __fish_git_prompt_showuntrackedfiles to a nonempty value. If there're\n+# untracked files, then a '%' will be shown next to the branch name.\n+#\n+# If you would like to see the difference between HEAD and its upstream, set\n+# __fish_git_prompt_showupstream to 'auto'. A \"<\" indicates you are behind, \">\"\n+# indicates you are ahead, and \"<>\" indicates you have diverged. You can\n+# further control behavior by setting __fish_git_prompt_showupstream to a\n+# space-separated list of values:\n+#     verbose        show number of commits head/behind (+/-) upstream\n+#     legacy         don't use the '--count' option available in recent versions\n+#                    of git-rev-list\n+#     git            always compare HEAD to @{upstream}\n+#     svn            always compare HEAD to your SVN upstream\n+# By default, __fish_git_prompt will compare HEAD to your SVN upstream if it\n+# can find one, or @{upstream} otherwise.

I think that being able to wrap shell commands or fish functions with another function by enhancing the supported arguments is n important and very powerful use case.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4627/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4624", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4624/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4624/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4624/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/4624", "id": 284703568, "number": 4624, "title": "Split command substitutions on NUL if one is found", "user": {"login": "faho", "id": 5185367, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5185367?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho", "html_url": "https://github.com/faho", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 402356383, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/labels/RFC", "name": "RFC", "color": "ffefe5", "default": false}, {"id": 4724778, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/labels/enhancement", "name": "enhancement", "color": "84b6eb", "default": true}, {"id": 278051545, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/labels/release%20notes", "name": "release notes", "color": "bfdadc", "default": false}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestone/18", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18/labels", "id": 2597361, "number": 18, "title": "fish-3.0", "description": "The proposed 3.0 major release of fish.

There's no way around that other than the idea that it's syntactic sugar.\r\n* *The law of user focus*: I don't know about anyone else, but I expected these operators to exist when I first used Fish. They're almost universal across other languages and shells, and they're the first thing I reached for. I realized that's a sample size of one, but I wonder if other people expect the same thing. The use of `;` also requires the user to understand that `and` is a command, which adds a bit of cognitive load.\r\n* *The law of discoverability*: When I type `&&` in a command, Fish prints out an error message telling me what I should have used `and` instead. However, I wish would just do what I wanted instead.

Printf debugging suggests that stuckness happens on `if not type -q __fish_command_not_found_handler` line, inside `__fish_disable_bracketed_paste` handler. Commenting-out `printf` inside that handler mitigates the issue.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n### Naive way in line how issue was noticed\r\n1. From cmd.exe run bash\r\n2. Verify that pid=2 via `echo $$`\r\n3. From bash run `exec fish`\r\n4. At this point fish hangs and terminal is unresponsive.\r\n5. Start another terminal emulator and perform steps 1 and 2.\r\n6. In 2nd terminal emulator you have working fish instance.\r\n7. Run `pkill fish` to kill all running fish instances. Go to step 1 to reproduce again.\r\n\r\n### Another way to reproduce proving that it is related to pid=2\r\n1. From cmd.exe run `bash`\r\n2. From another cmd.exe run `bash`\r\n3. Run `echo $$` in both terminals\r\n4. Run `exec fish` in a terminal where pid!=2, this starts fish just fine\r\n5. Run `exec fish` in a terminal where pid==2, this instance hangs\r\n\r\n4 and 5 can be reordered.\r\n\r\n## Further actions\r\nI am open to debug this further but I am not sure what to look for.\r\n\r\n## Use case\r\nThis is useful if you want to run fish as your main shell in WSL. fish can replace bash on startup via ~/.bashrc. Bash normally starts as pid=2 so as I would expect any other default shell to:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1058248/33801875-258125ac-dd61-11e7-991a-39a75bc3d799.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Possible mitigations\r\nMake it possible to disable [bracketed paste mode](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/3871#issuecomment-321034918).

I just read the Design Principles document today and that alone convinced me to switch to Fish. The switch has gone swimmingly so far -- Fish is completely living up to its \"Configurability is the root of all evil\" principle.\r\n\r\nI have run into one moderate problem. I already have a way to manage configuration state between machines (I use version controlled dotfiles, but the particulars of my solution aren't important here -- lots of other people use different ways). This makes Universal Variables a \"Law of Orthogonality\" violation for me. I'd like for my `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file to describe the entire state of Fish configuration on my machine, but now I also have to think about a second mechanism that also has its own way of storing state.\r\n\r\nThe few problems I've had so far have had to do with this issue, for instance not realizing I was setting a Universal Variables in my `config.fish` file, so when I removed it the setting still persisted. Persistent, mutable state on a machine is an easy way to create user confusion, and if we can get away without it (and the `config.fish` file already provides a great way of doing so) I think it's worth considering.\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks for Fish!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4542/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540", "id": 275014361, "number": 4540, "title": "`read | cat` crashes fish", "user": {"login": "JohnMH", "id": 2576152, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2576152?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH", "html_url": "https://github.com/JohnMH", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 4724776, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "fc2929", "default": true}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestone/18", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18/labels", "id": 2597361, "number": 18, "title": "fish-3.0", "description": "The proposed 3.0 major release of fish.

"[cmake] Untangle the CMake versioning\n\nThis untangles the CMake versioning issues (I hope) as discussed in #4626.\nNote most of the advice found on the Internet about how to inject git\nversions into CMake is just wrong.\n\nThe behavior we want is to unconditionally run the script\nbuild_tools/git_version_gen.sh at build time (i.e. when you invoke ninja or\nmake, and not when you invoke cmake, which is build system generation time).\nThis script is careful to only update the FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE if the\ncontents have changed, to avoid spurious rebuilding dependencies of\nFISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE. Assuming the git version hasn't changed, the script\nwill run, but not update FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE, and therefore\nfish_version.o will not have to be rebuilt.\n\nThis might normally rebuild more than is necessary even if the timestamp is\nnot updated, because ninja computes the dependency chain ahead of time. But\nNinja also supports the 'restat' option for just this case, and CMake is rad\nand exposes this via BYPRODUCTS. So mark FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE as a\nbyproduct and make the script always update a dummy file\n(fish-build-version-witness.txt). Note this is the use case for which\nBYPRODUCTS is designed.\n\nWe also have fish_version.cpp #include \"FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE\", and do a\nsemi-silly thing and make FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE valid C++ (so there's just\none version file). This means we have to filter out the quotes in other\ncases..", "tree": {"sha": "5d5b0822724da4a476dedab1c5b204f78262bf16", "url":

non-external\r\nprocess (a block/builtin/function) is inside a pipeline.\r\n\r\nThis keepalive process is then made the process group leader, which\r\ntheoretically stops the process group from being coopted by PID\r\nreuse (which I'm still not sure can actually happen).\r\n\r\nBut if a non-external process is first or last in the pipeline, then\r\nfish itself needs to read/write to the terminal, so it should remain\r\npgroup leader, and therefore the keepalive process is not needed.\r\n\r\nFixes #4540.\r\n\r\n## TODOs:\r\n<!-- Just check off what what we know been done so far. We can help you with this stuff. -->\r\n- [N/A] Changes to fish usage are reflected in user documentation/manpages.\r\n- [ ] Tests have been added for regressions fixed\r\n- [ ] User-visible changes noted in CHANGELOG.md\r\n", "created_at": "2018-01-10T15:58:21Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-18T17:06:06Z", "closed_at": null, "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha": "3ec134c218b3edec4301024af08c9ab26dc0577a", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestone/18", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18/labels", "id": 2597361, "number": 18, "title": "fish-3.0", "description": "The proposed 3.0 major release of fish.

-print0` in command substitutions.\r\n\r\nWhat this does is check if a NUL is in the comsub output and then split on that instead of newline,\r\nwhich makes `something (find -print0)` just work.\r\n\r\nThe one fly in the ointment is if there is a command that uses NULs to separate its output,\r\nbut doesn't print a trailing NUL if there is just one \"thing\" to print.\r\nThat would cause us to fall back to splitting on newlines, which might do the wrong thing.\r\n\r\nSo far, everything I've tested (`find`, `git config -z`) seemed to print a trailing NUL.\r\n\r\nThis implements a proposal by @cben.\r\n\r\nFixes #3164.\r\n\r\n## TODOs:\r\n<!-- Just check off what what we know been done so far. We can help you with this stuff. -->\r\n- [ ] Changes to fish usage are reflected in user documentation/manpages.\r\n- [x] Tests have been added for regressions fixed\r\n- [ ] User-visible changes noted in CHANGELOG.md\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis does one extra `memchr` per command substitution, which is probably not significant.

This can be used in your fish_prompt\n+# function.\n+#\n+# The behavior of __fish_git_prompt is very heavily based off of the bash\n+# script's __fish_git_prompt function. As such, usage and customization is very\n+# similar, although some extra flexibility is provided in this script.\n+#\n+# The argument to __fish_git_prompt will be displayed only if you are currently\n+# in a git repository. The %s token will be the name of the branch. If HEAD is\n+# not a branch, it attempts to show the relevant tag. The tag search is\n+# controlled by the __fish_git_prompt_describe_style variable, with the\n+# following values:\n+#     default (or unset)    Any tag that exactly matches HEAD\n+#     contains              Nearest annotated tag that contains HEAD\n+#     branch                Nearest tag/branch that contains HEAD\n+#     describe              Output of `git describe`\n+#\n+# In addition, if you set __fish_git_prompt_showdirtystate to a nonempty value,\n+# unstaged (*) and staged (+) changes will be shown next to the branch name.\n+# You can configure this per-repository with the bash.showDirtyState variable,\n+# which defaults to true once __fish_git_prompt_showdirtystate is enabled. The\n+# choice to leave the variable as 'bash' instead of renaming to 'fish' is done\n+# to preserve compatibility with existing configured repositories.\n+#\n+# You can also see if currently something is stashed, by setting\n+# __fish_git_prompt_showstashstate to a nonempty value. If something is\n+# stashed, then a '$' will be shown next to the branch name.\n+#\n+# If you would like to see if there're untracked files, then you can set\n+# __fish_git_prompt_showuntrackedfiles to a nonempty value. If there're\n+# untracked files, then a '%' will be shown next to the branch name.\n+#\n+# If you would like to see the difference between HEAD and its upstream, set\n+# __fish_git_prompt_showupstream to 'auto'. A \"<\" indicates you are behind, \">\"\n+# indicates you are ahead, and \"<>\" indicates you have diverged. You can\n+# further control behavior by setting __fish_git_prompt_showupstream to a\n+# space-separated list of values:\n+#     verbose        show number of commits head/behind (+/-) upstream\n+#     legacy         don't use the '--count' option available in recent versions\n+#                    of git-rev-list\n+#     git            always compare HEAD to @{upstream}\n+#     svn            always compare HEAD to your SVN upstream\n+# By default, __fish_git_prompt will compare HEAD to your SVN upstream if it\n+# can find one, or @{upstream} otherwise.

I think that being able to wrap shell commands or fish functions with another function by enhancing the supported arguments is n important and very powerful use case.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4627/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4624", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4624/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4624/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4624/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/4624", "id": 284703568, "number": 4624, "title": "Split command substitutions on NUL if one is found", "user": {"login": "faho", "id": 5185367, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5185367?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho", "html_url": "https://github.com/faho", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/faho/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 402356383, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/labels/RFC", "name": "RFC", "color": "ffefe5", "default": false}, {"id": 4724778, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/labels/enhancement", "name": "enhancement", "color": "84b6eb", "default": true}, {"id": 278051545, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/labels/release%20notes", "name": "release notes", "color": "bfdadc", "default": false}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestone/18", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18/labels", "id": 2597361, "number": 18, "title": "fish-3.0", "description": "The proposed 3.0 major release of fish.

There's no way around that other than the idea that it's syntactic sugar.\r\n* *The law of user focus*: I don't know about anyone else, but I expected these operators to exist when I first used Fish. They're almost universal across other languages and shells, and they're the first thing I reached for. I realized that's a sample size of one, but I wonder if other people expect the same thing. The use of `;` also requires the user to understand that `and` is a command, which adds a bit of cognitive load.\r\n* *The law of discoverability*: When I type `&&` in a command, Fish prints out an error message telling me what I should have used `and` instead. However, I wish would just do what I wanted instead.

Printf debugging suggests that stuckness happens on `if not type -q __fish_command_not_found_handler` line, inside `__fish_disable_bracketed_paste` handler. Commenting-out `printf` inside that handler mitigates the issue.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n### Naive way in line how issue was noticed\r\n1. From cmd.exe run bash\r\n2. Verify that pid=2 via `echo $$`\r\n3. From bash run `exec fish`\r\n4. At this point fish hangs and terminal is unresponsive.\r\n5. Start another terminal emulator and perform steps 1 and 2.\r\n6. In 2nd terminal emulator you have working fish instance.\r\n7. Run `pkill fish` to kill all running fish instances. Go to step 1 to reproduce again.\r\n\r\n### Another way to reproduce proving that it is related to pid=2\r\n1. From cmd.exe run `bash`\r\n2. From another cmd.exe run `bash`\r\n3. Run `echo $$` in both terminals\r\n4. Run `exec fish` in a terminal where pid!=2, this starts fish just fine\r\n5. Run `exec fish` in a terminal where pid==2, this instance hangs\r\n\r\n4 and 5 can be reordered.\r\n\r\n## Further actions\r\nI am open to debug this further but I am not sure what to look for.\r\n\r\n## Use case\r\nThis is useful if you want to run fish as your main shell in WSL. fish can replace bash on startup via ~/.bashrc. Bash normally starts as pid=2 so as I would expect any other default shell to:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1058248/33801875-258125ac-dd61-11e7-991a-39a75bc3d799.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Possible mitigations\r\nMake it possible to disable [bracketed paste mode](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/3871#issuecomment-321034918).

I just read the Design Principles document today and that alone convinced me to switch to Fish. The switch has gone swimmingly so far -- Fish is completely living up to its \"Configurability is the root of all evil\" principle.\r\n\r\nI have run into one moderate problem. I already have a way to manage configuration state between machines (I use version controlled dotfiles, but the particulars of my solution aren't important here -- lots of other people use different ways). This makes Universal Variables a \"Law of Orthogonality\" violation for me. I'd like for my `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file to describe the entire state of Fish configuration on my machine, but now I also have to think about a second mechanism that also has its own way of storing state.\r\n\r\nThe few problems I've had so far have had to do with this issue, for instance not realizing I was setting a Universal Variables in my `config.fish` file, so when I removed it the setting still persisted. Persistent, mutable state on a machine is an easy way to create user confusion, and if we can get away without it (and the `config.fish` file already provides a great way of doing so) I think it's worth considering.\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks for Fish!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4542/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4540", "id": 275014361, "number": 4540, "title": "`read | cat` crashes fish", "user": {"login": "JohnMH", "id": 2576152, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2576152?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH", "html_url": "https://github.com/JohnMH", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnMH/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 4724776, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "fc2929", "default": true}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestone/18", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18/labels", "id": 2597361, "number": 18, "title": "fish-3.0", "description": "The proposed 3.0 major release of fish.

"[cmake] Untangle the CMake versioning\n\nThis untangles the CMake versioning issues (I hope) as discussed in #4626.\nNote most of the advice found on the Internet about how to inject git\nversions into CMake is just wrong.\n\nThe behavior we want is to unconditionally run the script\nbuild_tools/git_version_gen.sh at build time (i.e. when you invoke ninja or\nmake, and not when you invoke cmake, which is build system generation time).\nThis script is careful to only update the FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE if the\ncontents have changed, to avoid spurious rebuilding dependencies of\nFISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE. Assuming the git version hasn't changed, the script\nwill run, but not update FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE, and therefore\nfish_version.o will not have to be rebuilt.\n\nThis might normally rebuild more than is necessary even if the timestamp is\nnot updated, because ninja computes the dependency chain ahead of time. But\nNinja also supports the 'restat' option for just this case, and CMake is rad\nand exposes this via BYPRODUCTS. So mark FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE as a\nbyproduct and make the script always update a dummy file\n(fish-build-version-witness.txt). Note this is the use case for which\nBYPRODUCTS is designed.\n\nWe also have fish_version.cpp #include \"FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE\", and do a\nsemi-silly thing and make FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE valid C++ (so there's just\none version file). This means we have to filter out the quotes in other\ncases..", "tree": {"sha": "5d5b0822724da4a476dedab1c5b204f78262bf16", "url":

non-external\r\nprocess (a block/builtin/function) is inside a pipeline.\r\n\r\nThis keepalive process is then made the process group leader, which\r\ntheoretically stops the process group from being coopted by PID\r\nreuse (which I'm still not sure can actually happen).\r\n\r\nBut if a non-external process is first or last in the pipeline, then\r\nfish itself needs to read/write to the terminal, so it should remain\r\npgroup leader, and therefore the keepalive process is not needed.\r\n\r\nFixes #4540.\r\n\r\n## TODOs:\r\n<!-- Just check off what what we know been done so far. We can help you with this stuff. -->\r\n- [N/A] Changes to fish usage are reflected in user documentation/manpages.\r\n- [ ] Tests have been added for regressions fixed\r\n- [ ] User-visible changes noted in CHANGELOG.md\r\n", "created_at": "2018-01-10T15:58:21Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-18T17:06:06Z", "closed_at": null, "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha": "3ec134c218b3edec4301024af08c9ab26dc0577a", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18", "html_url": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestone/18", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestones/18/labels", "id": 2597361, "number": 18, "title": "fish-3.0", "description": "The proposed 3.0 major release of fish.

-print0` in command substitutions.\r\n\r\nWhat this does is check if a NUL is in the comsub output and then split on that instead of newline,\r\nwhich makes `something (find -print0)` just work.\r\n\r\nThe one fly in the ointment is if there is a command that uses NULs to separate its output,\r\nbut doesn't print a trailing NUL if there is just one \"thing\" to print.\r\nThat would cause us to fall back to splitting on newlines, which might do the wrong thing.\r\n\r\nSo far, everything I've tested (`find`, `git config -z`) seemed to print a trailing NUL.\r\n\r\nThis implements a proposal by @cben.\r\n\r\nFixes #3164.\r\n\r\n## TODOs:\r\n<!-- Just check off what what we know been done so far. We can help you with this stuff. -->\r\n- [ ] Changes to fish usage are reflected in user documentation/manpages.\r\n- [x] Tests have been added for regressions fixed\r\n- [ ] User-visible changes noted in CHANGELOG.md\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis does one extra `memchr` per command substitution, which is probably not significant.

This can be used in your fish_prompt\n+# function.\n+#\n+# The behavior of __fish_git_prompt is very heavily based off of the bash\n+# script's __fish_git_prompt function. As such, usage and customization is very\n+# similar, although some extra flexibility is provided in this script.\n+#\n+# The argument to __fish_git_prompt will be displayed only if you are currently\n+# in a git repository. The %s token will be the name of the branch. If HEAD is\n+# not a branch, it attempts to show the relevant tag. The tag search is\n+# controlled by the __fish_git_prompt_describe_style variable, with the\n+# following values:\n+#     default (or unset)    Any tag that exactly matches HEAD\n+#     contains              Nearest annotated tag that contains HEAD\n+#     branch                Nearest tag/branch that contains HEAD\n+#     describe              Output of `git describe`\n+#\n+# In addition, if you set __fish_git_prompt_showdirtystate to a nonempty value,\n+# unstaged (*) and staged (+) changes will be shown next to the branch name.\n+# You can configure this per-repository with the bash.showDirtyState variable,\n+# which defaults to true once __fish_git_prompt_showdirtystate is enabled. The\n+# choice to leave the variable as 'bash' instead of renaming to 'fish' is done\n+# to preserve compatibility with existing configured repositories.\n+#\n+# You can also see if currently something is stashed, by setting\n+# __fish_git_prompt_showstashstate to a nonempty value. If something is\n+# stashed, then a '$' will be shown next to the branch name.\n+#\n+# If you would like to see if there're untracked files, then you can set\n+# __fish_git_prompt_showuntrackedfiles to a nonempty value. If there're\n+# untracked files, then a '%' will be shown next to the branch name.\n+#\n+# If you would like to see the difference between HEAD and its upstream, set\n+# __fish_git_prompt_showupstream to 'auto'. A \"<\" indicates you are behind, \">\"\n+# indicates you are ahead, and \"<>\" indicates you have diverged. You can\n+# further control behavior by setting __fish_git_prompt_showupstream to a\n+# space-separated list of values:\n+#     verbose        show number of commits head/behind (+/-) upstream\n+#     legacy         don't use the '--count' option available in recent versions\n+#                    of git-rev-list\n+#     git            always compare HEAD to @{upstream}\n+#     svn            always compare HEAD to your SVN upstream\n+# By default, __fish_git_prompt will compare HEAD to your SVN upstream if it\n+# can find one, or @{upstream} otherwise.
