It does not protect anyone's privacy unless the recipients believe it was set by a real human being, with a real preference for privacy over personalization.\n\nMicrosoft deliberately violates the standard.  They made a big deal about announcing that very fact.  Microsoft are members of the Tracking Protection working group and are fully informed of these facts.  They are fully capable of requesting a change to the standard, but have chosen not to do so.  The decision to set DNT by default in IE10 has nothing to do with the user's privacy.
