So the char-array is definitely a lot faster, and this is what it is all about, since this is a very prominent function during the conversion to Avro.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJoeri\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sqoop/issues/comments/208859666/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "vishnusn": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sqoop/pulls/16", "title": "Trunk", "body": "Sqoop-trunk\n", "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sqoop/pulls/15", "title": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'refs/remotes/apache/trunk' into trunk", "body": null, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sqoop/pulls/14", "title": "[SQOOP-2839]", "body": "On our investigation we found out this is related to Sqoop\u2019s internal implementation.

StringBuilders are inefficient, char arrays are a lot faster since everything is pre-allocated already. Furthermore, the overhead over constantly allocating a new object, and the fact that internally the StringBuilder will do some copying as well, make this an inefficient approach.\n\nFor example, I implemented your approach and instead of a 500% improvement with our method, I have a 230% increase in performance with the StringBuilder approach. So the char-array is definitely a lot faster, and this is what it is all about, since this is a very prominent function during the conversion to Avro.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJoeri\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sqoop/issues/comments/208859666/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "vishnusn": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sqoop/pulls/16", "title": "Trunk", "body": "Sqoop-trunk\n", "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sqoop/pulls/15", "title": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'refs/remotes/apache/trunk' into trunk", "body": null, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sqoop/pulls/14", "title": "[SQOOP-2839]", "body": "On our investigation we found out this is related to Sqoop\u2019s internal implementation.
