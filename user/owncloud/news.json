I thought this was useful once, but we did not need it\n- Also implement a modified date for feeds and folders so you don't have to fetch everything all over again\n- Provide helper routes to make syncing a breeze. You normally have three usecases, those should be reflected by three routes\n  - Initial sync: Fetch feeds, folders, unread + starred items: **GET /api/2.0.0/sync**\n  - Sync local changes (no return appart from errors because the next GET request fetches all changed items anyways):  **POST /api/2.0.0/sync** \n  \n  ``` json\n  {\"items\": [{\"id\": 1, \"read\": true, \"fingerprint\": \"some_hash\"}]}\n  ```\n  \n    The fingerprint is a hash over the title, url, content and enclosures and if it is the same in the current database, only the status (read/starred) will be returned to the client.\n  - Checking for new contents without changes:: **GET /api/2.0.0/sync**  + http cache headers\n\nThe response will be the changes.\n\nFurthermore creating feeds/folders that already exist should respond with the existing object instead of just returning an error message. This makes it very easy to create folders: you just submit the contents and if you get a 409 you just use the returned contents.\n\nIdeas?
