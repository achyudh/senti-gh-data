correctly but refresh is too short (5 seconds) and avatar don't show (only if you don't log in)\r\nThere may be a place to settle but I have not found despite days of research.\r\n\r\nI don't have screen for refresh but i have one for avatar missing : \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22099903/34914884-f0892990-f91b-11e7-96f9-cafad6d956d7.png)\r\n\r\nIf i log on with my

I hope this will lead to a working new calendar app soon, as this is in the work for a long time already. Anyway, maybe it is a good idea to take a little bit more time to focus on implementing a unified Web/Cal/CardDAV endpoint in core and use this in the calendar rework here, see https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/5939. As far as I know this is a (fartime) goal in core already, with first steps to be found in the private repository of @DeepDiver1975: https://github.com/DeepDiver1975/dav. As it looks like CalDAV still has to be implemented here, this might be the chance to do it right at the first place, instead of doing the same work twice and changing the underlying CalDAV implementation later on.\n\nAny opinions on how the calendar-rework should be handled? @georgehrke @jancborchardt @raghunayyar @DeepDiver1975 @karlitschek\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/issues/comments/137938677/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "MEMBER"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/calendar/pulls/comments/43395509", "body": "I don't know exactly what the \"multiselect issue\" is, but in case it is useful here: we use a multiselect directive for angular in the tasks app for selecting different categories.
