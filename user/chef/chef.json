But whenever we install a ruby gem via `chef_gem` resource, it always takes 3 minutes until completion. The only way it works immediatly is, if we use the `clear_sources` flag to set it to true.\r\n\r\nOur investigations showed that whenever an installation source is specified, the default `rubygems url` (rubygems.org) is used. It would be possible to set the `clear_sources` flag to clean the `rubygems_url` list and to avoid this problem, but that can not be made for shared cookbooks (such as push_jobs, etc). \r\n\r\n## Chef Version\r\nClient: 13.6.4\r\n\r\n## Platform Version\r\nLinux, Red Hat 7.4\r\n\r\n## Replication Case\r\n\r\n* Ensure an air-gapped client\r\n* Define a custom `rubygems_url` (via `client.rb`)\r\n* Run the following snipped that installs a not existing ruby gems\r\n\r\n```\r\nchef_gem 'chef-ruby-lvm' do\r\n  action [ :remove, :install ]\r\n  # clear_source true # uncomment to fix the 3min timeout. \r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same behaviour can be faced by using `gem install` directly.\r\n\r\n**3 Minutes installation duration:**\r\n```\r\ngem install --source http://rubygems.mycustomer.local/repository/rubygems mixlib-install --verbose\r\n...\r\nunable to pull data from https://rubygems.org/': timed out (https://api.rubygems.org/specs.4.8.gz)\r\n1 gem installed\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Instant installation duration:** \r\n```\r\ngem install --clear-sources --source http://rubygems.mycustomer.local/repository/rubygems mixlib-install --verbose\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Client Output\r\n\r\nThe behaviour without the `clear_sources` (with 3 minutes duration) is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2017-12-14T12:19:26+01:00] DEBUG: chef_gem[chef-ruby-lvm] no installed version found for chef-ruby-lvm (>= 0)\r\n[2017-12-14T12:19:26+01:00] DEBUG: found gem chef-ruby-lvm version 0.3.0 for platform ruby from \r\n[2017-12-14T12:19:26+01:00] DEBUG: chef_gem[chef-ruby-lvm] chef-ruby-lvm not installed, installing 0.3.0\r\n[2017-12-14T12:22:26+01:00] INFO: chef_gem[chef-ruby-lvm] installed chef-ruby-lvm at 0.3.0\r\n[32m- install version 0.3.0 of package chef-ruby-lvm[0m\r\n[0m[2017-12-14T12:22:26+01:00] DEBUG: chef_gem[chef-ruby-lvm] resetting gem environment to default\r\n```", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/chef/chef/issues/6729/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "martinmosegaard": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/chef/chef/issues/6724", "title": "Catch Errno::EINVAL in ConfigFetcher", "body": "<!--- \r\n!!!!!!

This is not because <user> authenticated correctly or because the <user> is missing the create permission. It is because using user-credentials on a bootstrap, recreates the client and node -- stripping permissions of the existing client and node.

Thus the missing create permission message. \r\n\r\nThe error message is very misleading and cost me over two days of developer time -- it should be rewritten to provide more detail to what exactly is missing permission.

We should print some debug information about the token like if it is elevated. With this information you'll see that when we run chef from an elevated shell, we still have an elevated token even if we run `has_admin_privileges?` from inside `with_user_context` using a regular user.\r\nThe above functionality was masked by this line in the before block in ```spec\\functional\\win32\\security_spec.rb:\r\nallow(Chef::ReservedNames::Win32::Security).to receive(:OpenProcessToken).and_return(true)```\r\nThis caused the 'running as non admin user' test to pass even though it should fail. Fixing this might be hard, because a regular user cannot use much of the functionality in `has_admin_privileges`, maybe not even calling `open_current_process_token`. One solution might be catching the access denied results and returning false, presuming that if we get an access denied in this area then we aren't elevated.\r\n\r\nNote that we reverted the functional tests in https://github.com/chef/chef/pull/6588 due odd behavior on Appveyor.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n- [x] able to run a ruby block with only the privileges of another user, while preserving the functionality needed by remote_file.\r\n- [x] `Chef::ReservedNames::Win32::Security.has_admin_privileges?` prints a debug message that contains token elevation information.\r\n- [x] The Chef::Win32::Security functional test for running as a non-admin user that was reverted is returned and does not return a false positive.\r\n- [x] The functional tests pass on appveyor or we have a documented reason to exclude them on appveyor. \r\n\r\n### Check List\r\n\r\n- [x] New functionality includes tests\r\n- [x] All tests pass\r\n- [ ] RELEASE\\_NOTES.md, has been updated if required (not required for bugfixes, required for API changes)\r\n- [x] All commits have been signed-off for the Developer Certificate of Origin.
