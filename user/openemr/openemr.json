That is, the encounter is created, the status is updated to (@ Arrived) and the [flow board](http://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/Patient_Flow_Board) also reflects the time they checked in and starts the clock counting.\r\n\r\n**Checks performed**\r\nIn an effort to ensure my code is as reliable as possible, I have performed the following checks\r\n\r\n- The same patient cannot check in twice\r\n- Only patients with appointments today can check in\r\n- If a patient has 2 appointments on the same day, nothing untoward happens, they are simply checked in for both simultaneously. The only time I can think of this happening is, for example, if they have an appointment with the Dr and then the nurse, say for phlebotomy services. Maybe the community can clarify for me?\r\n-  This feature can be enabled and disabled via the global preferences pane.\r\n\r\n**Documentation**\r\nI am working on docs - just let me know where to send them/post them.

That is, the encounter is created, the status is updated to (@ Arrived) and the [flow board](http://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/Patient_Flow_Board) also reflects the time they checked in and starts the clock counting.\r\n\r\n**Checks performed**\r\nIn an effort to ensure my code is as reliable as possible, I have performed the following checks\r\n\r\n- The same patient cannot check in twice\r\n- Only patients with appointments today can check in\r\n- If a patient has 2 appointments on the same day, nothing untoward happens, they are simply checked in for both simultaneously. The only time I can think of this happening is, for example, if they have an appointment with the Dr and then the nurse, say for phlebotomy services.

That is, the encounter is created, the status is updated to (@ Arrived) and the [flow board](http://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/Patient_Flow_Board) also reflects the time they checked in and starts the clock counting.\r\n\r\n**Checks performed**\r\nIn an effort to ensure my code is as reliable as possible, I have performed the following checks\r\n\r\n- The same patient cannot check in twice\r\n- Only patients with appointments today can check in\r\n- If a patient has 2 appointments on the same day, nothing untoward happens, they are simply checked in for both simultaneously. The only time I can think of this happening is, for example, if they have an appointment with the Dr and then the nurse, say for phlebotomy services. Maybe the community can clarify for me?\r\n-  This feature can be enabled and disabled via the global preferences pane.\r\n\r\n**Documentation**\r\nI am working on docs - just let me know where to send them/post them.

That is, the encounter is created, the status is updated to (@ Arrived) and the [flow board](http://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/Patient_Flow_Board) also reflects the time they checked in and starts the clock counting.\r\n\r\n**Checks performed**\r\nIn an effort to ensure my code is as reliable as possible, I have performed the following checks\r\n\r\n- The same patient cannot check in twice\r\n- Only patients with appointments today can check in\r\n- If a patient has 2 appointments on the same day, nothing untoward happens, they are simply checked in for both simultaneously. The only time I can think of this happening is, for example, if they have an appointment with the Dr and then the nurse, say for phlebotomy services. Maybe the community can clarify for me?\r\n-  This feature can be enabled and disabled via the global preferences pane.\r\n\r\n**Documentation**\r\nI am working on docs - just let me know where to send them/post them.

It's a nice way to get code submitted and reviewed, although can't use the merge feature (code needs to be committed to sourceforge and then mirrored to github). When you send a pull request, would also be useful to put a message in the sourceforge developer forum and link to the pull request there, so other developers can easily review the code also. Also useful to know your github branch that it came from, because then it's very easy to test you code (simply fetch the branch) locally.\n-brady\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/issues/comments/755991/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "OWNER"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openemr/openemr/issues/comments/756443", "body": "That's too bad about needing to put it into you master branch, because it's now not gonna be compatible with the official master branch.

That is, the encounter is created, the status is updated to (@ Arrived) and the [flow board](http://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/Patient_Flow_Board) also reflects the time they checked in and starts the clock counting.\r\n\r\n**Checks performed**\r\nIn an effort to ensure my code is as reliable as possible, I have performed the following checks\r\n\r\n- The same patient cannot check in twice\r\n- Only patients with appointments today can check in\r\n- If a patient has 2 appointments on the same day, nothing untoward happens, they are simply checked in for both simultaneously. The only time I can think of this happening is, for example, if they have an appointment with the Dr and then the nurse, say for phlebotomy services.
