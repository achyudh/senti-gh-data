If the `install.rdf` file contains a valid XXE payload (like the billion laughs attack https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack), this can cause a DoS scenario (and possibly even code execution). \r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/php-webdriver/blob/139980fb59bb0e48e47a1bc515ee4fb6e6848780/lib/Firefox/FirefoxProfile.php#L209\r\n\r\n### Remediation\r\nPrior to loading any xml, disable entities ensuring that the above-mentioned attacks will no longer be possible.\r\n`libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);`\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n* Php-webdriver version: 1.5.0\r\n* PHP version: 7.2.0\r\n* Selenium server version: 3.8.1\r\n* Operating system: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n* Browser used + version: Firefox\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/issues/519/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "sapzape": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/issues/513", "title": "Take element screenshot not implemented in php-webdriver", "body": "As per spec: https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#dfn-take-element-screenshot\r\nTake element screenshot is not implemented in php-webdriver.

I attempted to set the request timeout when creating a new instance of RemoteWebDriver, but that throws back the same error with the adjusted timeout. I'm not entirely positive what's going on, but if I revert this change everything works just fine again.

If the `install.rdf` file contains a valid XXE payload (like the billion laughs attack https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack), this can cause a DoS scenario (and possibly even code execution). \r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/php-webdriver/blob/139980fb59bb0e48e47a1bc515ee4fb6e6848780/lib/Firefox/FirefoxProfile.php#L209\r\n\r\n### Remediation\r\nPrior to loading any xml, disable entities ensuring that the above-mentioned attacks will no longer be possible.\r\n`libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);`\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n* Php-webdriver version: 1.5.0\r\n* PHP version: 7.2.0\r\n* Selenium server version: 3.8.1\r\n* Operating system: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n* Browser used + version: Firefox\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/issues/519/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "sapzape": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/issues/513", "title": "Take element screenshot not implemented in php-webdriver", "body": "As per spec: https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#dfn-take-element-screenshot\r\nTake element screenshot is not implemented in php-webdriver.

If the `install.rdf` file contains a valid XXE payload (like the billion laughs attack https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack), this can cause a DoS scenario (and possibly even code execution). \r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/php-webdriver/blob/139980fb59bb0e48e47a1bc515ee4fb6e6848780/lib/Firefox/FirefoxProfile.php#L209\r\n\r\n### Remediation\r\nPrior to loading any xml, disable entities ensuring that the above-mentioned attacks will no longer be possible.\r\n`libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);`\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n* Php-webdriver version: 1.5.0\r\n* PHP version: 7.2.0\r\n* Selenium server version: 3.8.1\r\n* Operating system: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n* Browser used + version: Firefox\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/issues/519/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "sapzape": {"issues": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/issues/513", "title": "Take element screenshot not implemented in php-webdriver", "body": "As per spec: https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#dfn-take-element-screenshot\r\nTake element screenshot is not implemented in php-webdriver.

This problem is occurring on both OSX Yosemite with PHP 5.4.33 + cURL 7.37.1, and CentOS 6.2 with PHP 5.4.34 + cURL 7.19.7\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/comments/10109865/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "review_comments": []}, "hgati": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/comments/11467383", "body": "Me too.\nOperation timed out after 30001 milliseconds with 0 bytes received.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/comments/11467383/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/comments/11467492", "body": "This problem is occurring on Ubuntu 14.02 + PHP 5.6.7 + curl 7.35.0\nMe too.\nOperation timed out after 30001 milliseconds with 0 bytes received.\n\n``` sh\nPHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'WebDriverCurlException' with message 'Curl error thrown for ht \ntp POST to /session/35bc7b40-08d1-11e5-9435-335f0dd12e48/url with params: {\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.aerop \nostale.com\\/product\\/index.jsp?productId=11790024&cp=3534618.3534619.3534623.3541049.19442956\"}\n\nOperation timed out after 300000 milliseconds with 0 bytes received' in /var/www/htdocs/vendo \nr/facebook/webdriver/lib/WebDriverExceptions.php:50\nStack trace:\n#0 /var/www/htdocs/vendor/facebook/webdriver/lib/remote/HttpCommandExecutor.php(233): WebDriv \nerException::throwException(-1, 'Curl error thro...', Array)\n#1 /var/www/htdocs/vendor/facebook/webdriver/lib/remote/RemoteWebDriver.php(491): HttpCommand \nExecutor->execute(Object(WebDriverCommand))\n#2 /var/www/htdocs/vendor/facebook/webdriver/lib/remote/RemoteWebDriver.php(171): RemoteWebDr \niver->execute('get', Array)\n#3 /var/www/htdocs/vendor/facebook/webdriver/lib/support/events/EventFiringWebDriver.php(86): \n RemoteWebDriver->get('http://www.aero...')\n#4  in /var/www/htdocs/vendor/facebook/webdriver/lib/WebDriverExceptions.php on line 50\n```\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/comments/11467492/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/comments/11490061", "body": "yes, this throws intermittently even at 300,000 not 30,000 \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/comments/11490061/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "review_comments": []}, "the-noob": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/comments/18590210", "body": "I feel this case should either throw an exception or return `$this`, `null` is not even mentioned in the docstring\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/comments/18590210/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/comments/18594173", "body": "I had a 'todo' in my list to mention/fix this for like 2 months and _I think_ the reason was that I couldn't start Selenium with a predefined profile (Windows/Cygwin) because this failed silently... but I'm not so sure now.\nAnyways, since it's under your radar it's all fine :)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/comments/18594173/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "NONE"}], "review_comments": []}, "tveronesi": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [], "commit_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/php-webdriver/comments/21103749", "body": "executing php example.php , system complains about no Cookie class defined ...
