I would prefer to deprecate it fully, but\nthere might still be legitimate reasons to use this.

They also have various\nthread-safety acrobatics, which make concurrent initialization within\nlibavformat safe. In addition, the libraries are moving towards making\ntheir global init functions safe, which removes all need for central\nglobal init. In particular, GnuTLS 3.5.16 and OpenSSL 1.1.0g have been\nfound to have safe init functions. In all cases, they use internal\nreference counters to avoid that the global uninit functions interfere\nwith concurrent uses of the library by other API users who called global\ninit.\n\nwinsock should be thread-safe as well, and maintains an internal\nreference counter as well.\n\nSince we still support ancient TLS libraries, which do not have this\nfixed, and since it's unknown whether winsock and GnuTLS\nreinitialization is costly in any way, don't deprecate the libavformat\nfunctions yet."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commits/6512ff72f9cc058e27646604caeacc4ef0dbd93e", "message": "avformat: deprecate another ffserver API leftover"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commits/cbbb2067341d7c2d98f560f81c6fb103af33a490", "message": "hwcontext_vdpau: implement av_hwdevice_get_hwframe_constraints()\n\nIn addition, this does not allow creating frames contexts with sw_format\nfor which no known transfer formats exist.

Is it just to solve the problem of `n` starting at 0 or 1?\n\nEdit1:\nOh mmh, I should have read your initial post, my bad.\n\nBut another note; now that the counter is stored in a common place (link->frame_count), I wonder if we couldn't have a more global starting number instead. That would make more sense when using for instance in combination with showinfo filter (which prints the n), or actually any kind of filters where the counter is used (anything with timeline for instance, or various expressions).\n\nEdit2:\nTo be more specific, maybe have a look to filters_common_options in avfilter.c, and try to add it here. Unfortunately, if you do that, it will be limited to each filter scope. Maybe we need some global libavfilter options, so when a `-start_n` is specified by a tool, it is populated everywhere. Such thing should be discussed on ffmpeg-devel mailing list or IRC.\n\nI know I'm being pedantic for such a trivial feature, but I believe it can be done way better and have a few benefits in the long term.

Is it just to solve the problem of `n` starting at 0 or 1?\n\nEdit1:\nOh mmh, I should have read your initial post, my bad.\n\nBut another note; now that the counter is stored in a common place (link->frame_count), I wonder if we couldn't have a more global starting number instead. That would make more sense when using for instance in combination with showinfo filter (which prints the n), or actually any kind of filters where the counter is used (anything with timeline for instance, or various expressions).\n\nEdit2:\nTo be more specific, maybe have a look to filters_common_options in avfilter.c, and try to add it here. Unfortunately, if you do that, it will be limited to each filter scope. Maybe we need some global libavfilter options, so when a `-start_n` is specified by a tool, it is populated everywhere. Such thing should be discussed on ffmpeg-devel mailing list or IRC.\n\nI know I'm being pedantic for such a trivial feature, but I believe it can be done way better and have a few benefits in the long term. Adding such option like this now will mean a depreciation burden next time it's implemented generically.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/issues/comments/18243491/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/issues/comments/18244469", "body": "Note: XYZ is supported for decoding since 0c47c9028be2cf4b1a557e653606fced5b959445\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/issues/comments/18244469/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "mjmvisser": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/issues/comments/18408496", "body": "Good idea (filters_common_options), I hadn't realized n was used outside of the drawtext filter.

They also have various\nthread-safety acrobatics, which make concurrent initialization within\nlibavformat safe. In addition, the libraries are moving towards making\ntheir global init functions safe, which removes all need for central\nglobal init. In particular, GnuTLS 3.5.16 and OpenSSL 1.1.0g have been\nfound to have safe init functions. In all cases, they use internal\nreference counters to avoid that the global uninit functions interfere\nwith concurrent uses of the library by other API users who called global\ninit.\n\nwinsock should be thread-safe as well, and maintains an internal\nreference counter as well.\n\nSince we still support ancient TLS libraries, which do not have this\nfixed, and since it's unknown whether winsock and GnuTLS\nreinitialization is costly in any way, don't deprecate the libavformat\nfunctions yet."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commits/6512ff72f9cc058e27646604caeacc4ef0dbd93e", "message": "avformat: deprecate another ffserver API leftover"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commits/cbbb2067341d7c2d98f560f81c6fb103af33a490", "message": "hwcontext_vdpau: implement av_hwdevice_get_hwframe_constraints()\n\nIn addition, this does not allow creating frames contexts with sw_format\nfor which no known transfer formats exist.

Is it just to solve the problem of `n` starting at 0 or 1?\n\nEdit1:\nOh mmh, I should have read your initial post, my bad.\n\nBut another note; now that the counter is stored in a common place (link->frame_count), I wonder if we couldn't have a more global starting number instead. That would make more sense when using for instance in combination with showinfo filter (which prints the n), or actually any kind of filters where the counter is used (anything with timeline for instance, or various expressions).\n\nEdit2:\nTo be more specific, maybe have a look to filters_common_options in avfilter.c, and try to add it here. Unfortunately, if you do that, it will be limited to each filter scope. Maybe we need some global libavfilter options, so when a `-start_n` is specified by a tool, it is populated everywhere. Such thing should be discussed on ffmpeg-devel mailing list or IRC.\n\nI know I'm being pedantic for such a trivial feature, but I believe it can be done way better and have a few benefits in the long term. Adding such option like this now will mean a depreciation burden next time it's implemented generically.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/issues/comments/18243491/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/issues/comments/18244469", "body": "Note: XYZ is supported for decoding since 0c47c9028be2cf4b1a557e653606fced5b959445\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/issues/comments/18244469/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "mjmvisser": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/issues/comments/18408496", "body": "Good idea (filters_common_options), I hadn't realized n was used outside of the drawtext filter.

Is it just to solve the problem of `n` starting at 0 or 1?\n\nEdit1:\nOh mmh, I should have read your initial post, my bad.\n\nBut another note; now that the counter is stored in a common place (link->frame_count), I wonder if we couldn't have a more global starting number instead. That would make more sense when using for instance in combination with showinfo filter (which prints the n), or actually any kind of filters where the counter is used (anything with timeline for instance, or various expressions).\n\nEdit2:\nTo be more specific, maybe have a look to filters_common_options in avfilter.c, and try to add it here. Unfortunately, if you do that, it will be limited to each filter scope. Maybe we need some global libavfilter options, so when a `-start_n` is specified by a tool, it is populated everywhere. Such thing should be discussed on ffmpeg-devel mailing list or IRC.\n\nI know I'm being pedantic for such a trivial feature, but I believe it can be done way better and have a few benefits in the long term. Adding such option like this now will mean a depreciation burden next time it's implemented generically.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/issues/comments/18243491/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/issues/comments/18244469", "body": "Note: XYZ is supported for decoding since 0c47c9028be2cf4b1a557e653606fced5b959445\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/issues/comments/18244469/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "commit_comments": [], "review_comments": []}, "mjmvisser": {"issues": [], "commits": [], "pull_requests": [], "issue_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/issues/comments/18408496", "body": "Good idea (filters_common_options), I hadn't realized n was used outside of the drawtext filter.
