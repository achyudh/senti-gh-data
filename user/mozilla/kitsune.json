We want visitors on `support.mozilla.org` to be able to write to database and thus we need a database solution which supports writes from multiple locations. \r\n - Recently AWS announced Aurora Multi Master support.

Either way Aurora only supports multi-AZ Multi Master at the moment (2018-01-15) with a plan to support multi-Region in the future. We can re-eval when multi-Region becomes available but for the time being we need an alternative plan.\r\n\r\n## Suggested Database Architecture:\r\n\r\n - Replication in RDS using MariaDB is known to work well. \r\n - The Arch defines:\r\n   - A DB in **Oregon** as the **Master** database\r\n   - Databases in  **other regions** (currently Frankfurt and Tokyo) as **Read Replicants** of the Master database\r\n - Kitsune instances in **all regions** use [django-multidb-router](https://github.com/jbalogh/django-multidb-router) in **Pinning Mode** to route write db operations to **Oregon** while read operations get routed to the nearest Read Replica.\r\n - We need a secure tunnel between Oregon and other regions, using Inter-Region VPC Peering where supported or other method where not supported.\r\n\r\n![prod after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/584352/34943770-bc5a3e8a-fa05-11e7-9ed8-1b8667413846.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Pre AWS Migration - Development Architecture\r\n\r\n - To develop and test the architecture we want to setup a minimal version with a Master Database in Oregon and a Read Replica in Frankfurt.\r\n - The Master Database will get populated with a recent anonymized SQL dump.
