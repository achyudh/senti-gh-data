We have `requests` (amongst many other things) in `./webapp-django/vendor` and `./webapp-django/vendor-local`. That's the definitive place to put dependencies. Due to a couple of funfactory lines in `manage.py` it makes sure those two directories trumps anything in the environment. \n\nActually it's quite harmless then. So if you have `requests` version X in the virtualenv (or system python for that matter) and you have `requests` version Y in vendor-local, then django will pick up `requests` version Y.\n\nIt is by far the worse decision every made for playdoh to try to maintain a requirements file when what really matters is the vendor directories. That's why I always wipe it from all but compiled stuff. At least I try to. \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/comments/5580284/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/comments/8464903", "body": "This is no longer correct. \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/comments/8464903/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}], "review_comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/pulls/comments/231332", "body": "This file needs to be removed and `docs/_build` needs to be added to the socorro's `.gitignore`\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/pulls/comments/231332/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/pulls/comments/231334", "body": "These two paragraphs are now wrong. \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/pulls/comments/231334/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/pulls/comments/245520", "body": "Are you sure this will work with ReST?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/pulls/comments/245520/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/pulls/comments/219083", "body": "RTD updates immediately if you commit to the master on socorro-docs on github. post-commit hook love\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/pulls/comments/219083/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/pulls/comments/219092", "body": "If this is a base class, name it so. \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/pulls/comments/219092/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/pulls/comments/219127", "body": "why isn't this self.get_parameters(...)?\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/pulls/comments/219127/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/pulls/comments/219134", "body": "oh, it's a staticmethod. right?\nStill looking quite odd. \n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/pulls/comments/219134/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0}, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-services/socorro/pulls/comments/219159", "body": "Why are all of these static methods?
